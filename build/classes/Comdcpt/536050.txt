We are excited about community comments regarding the game and additions y'all would like to see.  Do you's guys want custom avatars?  Would you pay for them?  Maybe best community suggestion gets a free avatar of their choice?  As stated earlier, we aren't focused on AAA presentation because we would rather play a sloppy ball of fun than a highly polished easily palatable turd.  Not that there is anything wrong with Assassin's Creed, we even liked Unity!  So you can buy now at a cheap rate and come along for the ride or you can sit back, buy it later, and said you owned it all along...hipster. ;)","about_the_game":"This demo includes one inside room and the yard of 994 W 24th.
