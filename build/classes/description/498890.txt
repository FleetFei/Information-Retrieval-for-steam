							D&D Tokens Volume 1D&D Tokens Volume 1 is a collection of monsters and NPCs from D&D's past that you can use with your modern Dungeons & Dragons game or with any fantasy game on Fantasy Grounds. These tokens were originally featured in the D&D Monster Vault boxed set, but have been presented in a completely new format with just the tokens - all digitally rendered and loaded into a token module for use with Fantasy Grounds.* Note that the art from these creatures and NPCs come from D&D 4th Edition, and may have been visually re-concepted or may not have a corresponding monster or NPC in the latest version of Dungeons & Dragons. They can be used for custom creations or variants of existing creatures.This set features digital tokens for the following iconic monsters and NPCs from Dungeons &Dragons:    abyssal eviscerator    air elemental    ambush drake    angel    angel valor    babau    balor    beholder gauth    black dragon    bloodseeker    blue dragon    bugbear    bulette    carrion crawler    cave spider    chain devil    croc    crushgrip constrictor    cyclops    deathjump spider    deathknight    demonic minotaur    direbear    direrat    direwolf    displacer beast    doomspinner spider    doppelganger    dracolich    dragoborn sorceror    dragonbor nmale    dretch    drider    drow female    drow male    dryad    duergar    dwarf female    dwarf male    earth archon    earth elemental    effreet    eladrin female    eladrin male    elf female    elf male    ettin    female human guard    fire archon    fire elemental    fire giant    fire giant2    fire titan    flesh golem    frost giant    frost giant2    frost titan    gargoyle    gelatinous cube    ghoul    githyanki    gnoll    gnome female    gnome male    goblin    goblin minion    green dragon    green slime    guard drake    hag    halfling female    halfling male    hezrou    hillgiant    hillgiant female    hill titan    hobgoblin    horse    human male guard    human male wizard    human minion    hyena    ice archon    ice devil    imp    iron golem    kobold    lich    lizardfolk blackscale    lizard greenscale    manticore    marilith    medusa    medusa male    mindflayer    minotaur    mummy    ochre jelly    ogre    orca rcher    orc shaman    orc warrior    otyugh    owlbear    pitfiend    poison lizard    psuedodragon    purple worm    ragedrake    rakshasa    red dragon    roper    rust monster    shark    skeleton    skeleton minion    spider swarm    spitting cobra    spitting drake    stirge    stone golem    succubus    tiefling female    tiefling male    treant    troglodyte minion    troglodyte warrior    troll    troll render    umberhulk    vampire female    vampire male    vampire spawn    vrock    water archon    water elemental    wererat    werewolf    whitedragon    wolf    wraith    yuan-ti    yuan-ti2    yuan-ti3    Zombie    zombie hulk    zombie minion
