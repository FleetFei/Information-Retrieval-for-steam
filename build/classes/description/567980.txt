
							About This Game
							Introducing Santa Rockstar . A guitar rhythm game featuring a badass Santa travelling the world playing Rock/Metal versions of classic Christmas carols. 

Slay guitar solos as a tattooed, heavy metal loving Santa. Grind on with your band of pierced, leather wearing, reindeer – all while riding on your sleigh and delivering gifts ’round the world. 

Santa Rockstar keeps you rocking-on around the Christmas tree with holiday favorites, such as: Jingle Bells, Carol of the Bells, March of the Nutcracker, Silent Night, God Rest ye Gentlemen, We Wish You A Merry Christmas, Joy to the World, Santa is in Trouble, Little Bells for You, Hark the Herald, Snowball Fight, Three Wise Men, Santa’s Journey Begins. 

This Santa’s probably not checking to see if you’re naughty or nice, making Santa Rockstar a perfect gift for those that don’t do Christmas Carols and prefer to, shred open gifts, tip-back some eggnog, and party on!
