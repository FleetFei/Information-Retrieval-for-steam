Escape Goat 2 is the follow-up to the critically-acclaimed 2011 indie game, featuring more than double the content: larger rooms, HD graphics, dynamic lighting, and a host of devilish new traps. Pick your path through the massive Stronghold, divided into ten unique zones. Worry not, brave Goat, for you have a friend on this mission: Your immortal mouse familiar can crawl to otherwise unreachable areas, to hit switches and distract enemies. Use your wits, reason, reflexes and courage to overcome each room, and save your friends from an eternal slumber... Over 100 rooms of puzzles, traps, and sheeply lore With destructible and movable walls, the rooms take on many forms as you manipulate hidden machinery to reach the exit Fully hand-drawn, hi-def art and animation, brought to life with a custom lighting engine Epic 90's Redbook Audio soundtrack, featuring guest track by Disasterpeace (composer, FEZ)Listen to the soundtrack!
