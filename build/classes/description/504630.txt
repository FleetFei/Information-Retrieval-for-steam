							Experience the thrill of flying from the comfort of your broomstick. Blast your way across the field to score the winning goal before time runs out! 

Learn to Fly, Score, and Fight as you prepare your skills for the game day! 

We want everyone to know that we are working on polishing the game and adding in a multiplayer mode as well. We are releasing Broomball for free before the update because we want to get feedback on the game mechanics to make sure we can provide the best experience for everyone. We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we have enjoyed the development process. 

Happy Hunting,

The Broomball Team

We will also be releasing free tutorials on www.leadingones.com detailing our development process for any developers out there who are interested in getting started with making their own VR games!
