							In this Lovecraft-Inspired short, Katie (Adriene Mishler) takes her brother John (Brock England) to the site of an accident he's just had in his car. The only thing they find there is a strange amulet. When she tries to call John the next day, his number has been disconnected. But when she investigates his disappearance, her life takes a turn for the worse. Much worse. Maybe when you hit someone with your car in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere, it's best to call an ambulance.Directed by: Jason NeulanderProduced by: Christopher Shea, Jason NeulanderStarring: Adriene Mishler, Brock England, Jessie Douglas, Victor Steele
