							Utilizing his control over all electromagnetism, Magneto has used his powers for many purposes: leader of the Brotherhood, terrorist, and even X-Man. Once a close friend of Professor Charles Xavier, Magneto took a more extreme path against prejudice and used his powers to prove mutantkind's superiority by any means necessary. Not an unreasonable man by any means, Magneto has been known to work on the side of angels if he feels it will accomplish noble goals and this time is no different.Items Included in this Pack:MagnetoMagneto Marvel NOW!
