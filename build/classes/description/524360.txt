This is the second Episode in the soon-to-be long running Farnham Fables series. Buying this will unlock the entire second Episode on the newly created Episode list on Tape 1. It plays exactly the same as the first Episode, only with new characters, new locations, new story, new music, new everything! If you liked the first Episode, or maybe just kinda liked it but thought maybe things could be just a little better, then you'll really enjoy the second Episode maybe!
