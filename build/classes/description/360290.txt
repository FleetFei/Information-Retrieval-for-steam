
							About This Video
							This is a feature length documentary filmed between 2009 -2012 in the USA and in Copenhagen.
Us and the Game Industry explores computer game development.

A developer cluster was invited to contribute to discussion on design outcomes with this new form.

Developers share their motivation, design process, focus and execution of game ideas.

They include:
Jason Rohrer, Alexander Bruce, Die Gute Fabrik, Zack Gage and  programmers and designers at thatgamecompany.

Each developer has a different style and takes a different direction. Each wonders about the potential of digital game design.
Filming begins in San Francisco and expands significantly to an observation of processes at thatgamecompany as the team builds,completes and offers JOURNEY, a networked game play for two on PS3, to the public.

Composer, Austin Wintory, for JOURNEY, breaks new ground with a score made interactive for networked play. Many aspects of  the game design process for JOURNEY received world recognition. Antichamber went on to be heralded as an engagement in " an  Escher-like world". Other explorations are here: Mutazione from Die Gute Fabrik and  J.S JOUST are presented. The Castle Doctrine from Jason Rohrer and SpellTower from Zach Gage are considered. And, threading through, Robin Hunicke, Jenova Chen, Kellee Santiago, John Edwards et al - are exemplary figures of a long- term excitement and engagement with this design field who celebrate life and challenge the threat of mediocrity in the form. All participants in the film remain active with next games or ventures.
