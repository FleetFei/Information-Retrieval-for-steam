							The world of TERA is pretty big, and if you want to see it all, you’re going to need a fast mount—and the ability to teleport around the map doesn’t hurt, either! This pack will help you get around in TERA faster. The Explorer’s Pack contains:
Night Mare Mount–A fiery mount that lets you travel much more quickly—and it looks as fearsome as hell! This a permanent account-bound mount. It does not expire and can be used by any character on your account.Village Atlas (7 days)–Allows you to fast-travel to any town or city that you've discovered—for when you’re in a hurry. The Village Atlas lasts for seven days. The item's usage time decreases even when you're offline.Travel Journal (7 days)–Lets you “save” up to five locations, anywhere on the TERA map, and teleport directly to them—handy when you need to take a quick trip back to town. The Travel Journal lasts seven days. The item's usage time decreases even when you're offline.
