							You knew there was gonna be some sort of pirate-skin at some point, right? Chatting in piratespeech will never be more appropriate than when you rock this baby during an Awesomenauts match. All Yo Ho's, plank-walking references, plundering references and buried treasure references will be 74,2% funnier (and totally non-cliche) if you are manly enough to tread the interstellar battlefields as Cap'n Vinnie & Seadog Spike.


This DLC contains a custom skin for Vinnie & Spike in Awesomenauts, and will automatically unlock the character if you have not already done so.
