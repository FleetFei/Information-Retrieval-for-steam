							"Play as the newest adventurer to enter the Gauntlet - Lilith the Necromancer.  Using her expertise in dark magic and her knowledge of the Book of the Dead, Lilith summons a pack of undead skeletons to rise from the ground and strike her enemies before they quickly vanish.  She also has the ability to Ghostwalk through her foes to either slow them down or make a hasty retreat.  
And with every enemy she destroys or Ghostwalks through, Lilith builds up her “Soul Power” which allows her to call forth Skeleton Fighters that fight independently of her as allies. Download and play as the Master of Necromancy today!"
