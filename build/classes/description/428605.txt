							Fantasy Zone is famous for its free scrolling and shop system. Similar to the original, shooting down enemies will drop coins, which you can use to buy stronger attacks.

This DLC will add 1 ship, playable in DLC Mode.
You will receive access to 3 special stages designed specially for this ship. (Only scores using this ship will be registered in the special stages.)
You will also get access to the SEGA pack: 10 newly arranged stages including 3 boss fights, as well as CS PACK 2: 10 stages from CS mode.
Buying any DLC also lets you use all the DARIUSBURST ships from the base game in the DLC Mode stages.
