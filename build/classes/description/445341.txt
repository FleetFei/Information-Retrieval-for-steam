							This faction flair pack adds new flavor to the fierce dwarves of the Brising Clan. One of the first dwarven clans to wander through Nidavellir, the Brisings were led by their chieftain Modsognir to settle in Svarinshaug, braving the forces of nature. The clan has a passion for metalworking even greater than that of most dwarven, and their flaming forges have produced some of the greatest artifacts the land has ever seen.Acquire this pack to get the full experience when playing the The First Dwarves campaign!Features:Brising command panel interfaceNew graphics for the Brising Clan's SmithyNew portraits for Brising Miners, Skilled Miners, Expert Miners and MilitiaNew basic shield icon for Brising soldiers with the clan's symbol (also used for the Brising Round Shield item), with corresponding unit graphicsDwarven Mead Hall, Bastion and Transport graphics containing the Brising symbol (along with some minor modifications)Graphics by Jo√£o Victor G.
