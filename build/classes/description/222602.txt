Constructed from 1998 onwards, the Class 424 is similar in appearance to the DB Class 425 and 423 trainsets, but are better suited to the low platforms on the Hanover network with their comparatively low floor height.In total 40 units have been built by Adtranz/Bombardier and Siemens, and many units carry the names of towns and cities on the Hanover S-Bahn network.The Class 424 for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn’s distinctive red and white livery and features a SIFA driver vigilance device, LZB and PZB90 cab signalling.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB Class 424 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
