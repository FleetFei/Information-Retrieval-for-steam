							Eliza takes the stage!

Eliza is a diva with a secret - a dark and ancient past. Host to the skeletal parasite, Sekhmet, Eliza manipulates her own blood to ruthlessly crush her foes. 

Thanks to the incredible support of Skullgirls’ fans, Eliza is the third of 5 additional characters funded by Lab Zero’s Indiegogo campaign to be added to Skullgirls Encore.

Eliza features the same stunning, feature-quality animation and great gameplay you've come to expect from Skullgirls and Lab Zero Games, as well as a story mode and detailed tutorials so you can learn more about her and the Skullgirls world!
