
							About This Game
							《PRICE》 is a free puzzle game. Ivry woke up from nightmare, finding himself in a wierd chamber. He had to seek for truth as well as his sister Iva so as to escape from darkness and get out of terror. 

This game imports a new system for "Clue Combis" aside from traditional puzzle solving. 

As the game processes, the background music becomes more complete, and a final version of music awaits at the end of game. 

An updated decoder is recommended for a better experience, since there're 11 video performances to cover the whole story.
