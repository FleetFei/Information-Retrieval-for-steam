							You are the pilot of a highly maneuverable fighter ship codenamed the “Fury”, after the Furies of ancient Mythology. The Fury is made possible by a super conductive core, fused of lava from beneath the surface of Earth and “cryo-lava” from Titan, one of the moons of Venus. Utilizing a newly discovered elemental binding, it has become possible to create a “Geocore” that can generate enough power to drive superconductive technology. An insanely powerful drive system allows the ship and pilot to create a magnetic sphere in which the ship can move in any direction freely and with no inertia. It is up to you to pilot this advanced machine to investigate the mines, where highly advanced robots and remote mining machinery have been deployed to gather the elements needed to make more Geocores. Nothing has been heard from either the robot crews or the mining machines in one of the main facilities, and you have been called upon to investigate.
