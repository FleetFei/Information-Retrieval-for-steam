							Eric Brooks' mother was attacked by a vampire while giving birth, which would change Eric's fate forever. Becoming part man and part vampire, Eric retained many of the powers vampires possessed - including incredible speed, strength, and ability to sense other supernatural creatures - without suffering many of the weaknesses such as vulnerability to sunlight... but did not spare him the curse of bloodthirst. Referred to as the Daywalker by those he hunts, Eric Brooks swore vengeance against all vampires and became Blade - the vampire-slayer.Items Included in this Pack:Blade in default Undead Again CostumeBlade Hero S.T.A.S.H.
