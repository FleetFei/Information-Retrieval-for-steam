							SINISTRY SILINIUM is a psychological thriller packed together with action, stealth, and puzzle elements. Emphasizing a creepy grasping atmosphere, a perfection of artistic imagery makes up this game. No less time and attention are dedicated to the development of its narrative, combat system, and realistic in-game physics.You play as someone who finds themselves in a little town, where a secret sound wave emitting experiment-gone-wrong makes the local populace lose their mind and go out-of-ordinary insane. Not only have you to make it out of there alive, but also you are to make your choices at every turn — choices that will decide how this story concludes. Local dwellers — now victims of the horrible experiment,- aren't all dangerously aggressive and therefore can be spared. By avoiding violence you save the much needed ammo and possibly gain access to previously unavailable locations and plot lines, which remain closed off if you choose the run-and-gun play style. Make no mistake — sorting friends from foes is not as easy as it might first seem. Growing intensity and unease shall become your constant watchers and mentors.Every object within the game can be examined and manipulated just like in reality. Items react to touch in all the meaningful ways and may play a tremendous part in your character's survival. Many of the puzzles are built around the physical interactions, and the town's inhabitants don't just spew blood when shot, being appropriately animated for the occasion.On top of that you will visit surreal scenes caused by the protagonist's hallucinations, because he too did not escape the fate of the remaining residents of the town.Features:Deep atmosphere Unusual storyInteractive environmentPhysical interaction with objectsGood replayabilityMultiple endingsElements of surrealism
