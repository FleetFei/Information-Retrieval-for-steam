							Hektor’s demo features the game’s entire first level, which includes the procedurally generated corridors that set Hektor apart from other titles in its genre. From playing this level, Steam users can expect to get an excellent feel for the game. After completing the demo, players who do decide to buy the full version game, can pick up right where they left off without having to restart from the beginning.
