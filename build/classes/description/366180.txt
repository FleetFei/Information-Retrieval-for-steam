							Meet the disposable heroes... A rag-tag band of nobodies who - quite by accident - represent the kingdom's last hope. With the royal army slain it is they who must venture across the land on a quest to bring back the head of the king's son so that the light might return. If they had a brain cell between them they might actually be dangerous. -The game will have a 2 player co-op system. (Play alone or let a friend join the game to fight side by side with you on your quest.)ONCE UPON A TIME, IN A LAND FORGOTTEN BY MANY, LIVED A KING AND HIS WIFE, HAPPILY MARRIED AND LOVED BY THEIR SUBJECTS.ON ONE DAY THE NEWSBOY SHOUTED ‘LONG LIVE THE KING AND HIS SON!
