							Sorin Markov’s fully unlocked “Blood Hunger” black deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Sorin Markov is older than most other Planeswalkers you’ve encountered. His multiple millennia have brought him an easy confidence and a host of loyal followers. This deck is packed with deadly vampires ready to feast on the opposition. Of course, you may need to snack on your own every once in a while too. Only the strongest will survive. Let the blood hunt begin!
