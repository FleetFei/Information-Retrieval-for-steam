							The Braves & Bows is adventure platformer game in the open world. Here you can explore the castle and it's surroundings, placed on island that disconnected from other world. You should use a bow to fight with enemies that settled in the castle. As the process move forward you can improve your bow with help of masters located in different parts of the castle. During the fight with your enemies you will earn money that you can use to buy stuff for bow improvement and arrows with different effects. Some arrows will be effective against one type of enemies, but worse against another, and vise versa. Also some types of arrows can be useful for puzzle solving. 
As you move to the final you will get different abilities that will allow you to go back and explore places you couldn't visit before.
