							Younger sister to the X-Men's Colossus, Illyana Rasputin was raised into a world that would continuously try to engulf her. Abducted by the demon lord Belasco, Illyana was raised in the hell dimension Limbo in order to allow Belasco the means to ascend to absolute power. Belasco's plan ultimately relied on the corruption of the young Illyana's soul, for each piece of her soul he corrupted, Belasco would harness its power. Ultimately resorting to teaching her the dark arts in order to complete her corruption, Illyana began executing Belasco's downfall--invariably taking his place as the mutant ruler of Limbo: Magik!Items Included in this Pack:Magik in default Marvel NOW!
