							What is one small step for a human, is one GiAnt adventure for an Ant....Become an Ant in this fun filled first-person platformer from the indie solo developer at 'Wreck Tangle Games'. Roam vast human sized worlds as a tiny little ant, but this is no Ant Simulator! This is an AntVenture! Our protagonist must find sweet delectables whilst being hunted by all manner of creatures, animals and insects!! Spiders, Fly’s, Rats, Wasps, Cockroaches and even humans will stop at nothing to get rid of the ant infestation! Candy isn’t just lying around either; puzzles fill the worlds blocking you from success! Solve the puzzles whilst avoiding, running from or fighting your enemies! Hit enemies with your trusty match stick to make a path to safety!---------------------- You have been nominated as the sweet collecting ant, the most challenging of all food collecting teams, as those fatty humans do not often drop these little delectables. You must roam vast human sized worlds hunting for those goodies that have been littered by man, but not all treasures are just lying around, obstacles and challenges will get in your way at every corner. Plus, you're not the only one looking for food either, while collecting our tiny hero must avoid or fight other insects and vermin who are hunting for the same thing (*and don't forget those pesky humans). You are equipped with a Matchstick to fight with and your 'Antdar' a natural radar that all ant's possess, this will help you find the next candy piece, power ups and even your way back home. Power ups are scattered around the worlds to help you survive and reach previously unreachable areas! Jumping higher or running faster may come in useful.
