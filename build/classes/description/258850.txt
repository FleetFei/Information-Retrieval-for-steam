							Hive - The Pillbug is an expansion piece for the core Hive game.

The Pillbug adds a lot of depth and new strategies to traditional Hive.  While the Pillbug itself moves slowly just like the Queen (ie. one space at at time), it does have its own special abliity:  It is able to pick up its neighboring pieces and move them regardless if they are a friends or foe!  The Pillbug adds a whole new level of defensive and offensive strategy to the game!

You can use the Pillbug in all of the game modes available in the core Hive game, including online, local, and games against the computer.  You can also earn new achievements that can only be granted using the Pillbug's special abilities!
