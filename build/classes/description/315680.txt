							Magic is not an art or religion. Magic is a craft. Experience an amazing and unforgettable adventure set in a dark fantasy universe! Spellcrafter is an RPG game with deep tactical turn-based combat and a unique spell casting system. Explore the magical world, collect gold, interact with NPCs, take quests and make moral choices! Recruit heroes, assemble and summon powerful troops and send them into battle! The unique feature of Spellcrafter is the spell casting system. The game recognizes the sign you draw on the screen and automatically chooses the appropriate spell from the spellbook. If you donâ€™t remember the correct sign you are able to consult the spellbook, but beware! Reaching for the spellbook takes additional time and the quicker you cast your spell, the more powerful it will be! The game is divided into 3 acts. Each act tells a part of a compelling and magical story about the nature of reality, power and morality. Additionally, each act features 3 levels with a different setting and a different playable character (human, necromancer, elf).
