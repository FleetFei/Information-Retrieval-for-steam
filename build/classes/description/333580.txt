							Slow Down, Bull is an action collecting game about a stressed out, overachiever bull who just wants to make beautiful art. Help steer Esteban through a beautiful schoolcraft art world to collect as many crafty pieces as you can, but be careful! Every time you steer him, he gets a little more stressed out, and you DON'T want to stress him out! Run and bounce around levels in 5 different areas, avoid knocking over hapless denizens, don't get caught by Annette the Bullcatcher, and above all, keep your cool! Meet new critter friends to help Esteban achieve his dreams of being the best he can possibly be. Replay levels to improve your scores!In partnership with Starlight Children's Foundation, 50% of Insomniac's net proceeds from Slow Down, Bull (at least 30% of the purchase price) will benefit Starlight's efforts to improve the life and health of kids and families around the world.
