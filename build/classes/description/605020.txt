Intro is what greets you to Mountain Mind world in a calmly manner, with layered solos.

Asteroid Blues is the fusion between rather Homme like riffs with heavily tuned and toned guitar, with a lenghty solo to accompany.

Xardoz is the heaviest and darkest piece of Mountain Mind, you will not be able to stop yourself from headbanging with these heavy riffs and solos behind them.

Like Tears In Rain intro appeared from the thin line between blues and stoner rock, continued to its stoner form with heavy riffs and a vocal to accompany.

Palm Desert '87 is the fastest piece on EP with its well settled riff and layered solos at the end. 

Goddess of Time is a one shot improvisation record which takes its inspiration from Colour Haze, it's a journey to live by.

Sunset of Valley is the calm end of the experience, watching sunset in the valley.
