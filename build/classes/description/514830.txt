							Stifled is a Mic-Enabled Sound-Based Survival Thriller, where sound is the only way you see and the enemies HEAR your fear. In Stifled, the sounds made by your in-game character and yourself through *microphone input reveal the otherwise hidden world through ‘echolocation’. However, undue noise will attract the attention of creatures lurking in the darkness. To survive, you will have to tread the line between making sounds to see, and staying quiet to stay hidden. (Put the microphone near your nose for even more challenge!)Microphone InputMicrophone input is recommended but not necessary.Sound generation can be replaced with a key input if you choose to.VR SupportThe game currently supports the Oculus DK2 and CV1 headsets.Support for OSVR and Vive is planned for.Stifled is the spiritual successor to our award winning student project, Lurking.
