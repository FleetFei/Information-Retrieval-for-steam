							Bunker Punks is a roguelike first-person shooter set in a dystopian future. You control a group of revolutionaries, raiding corporate strongholds for supplies, weapons and armor. Customize your bunker, strengthen your gang and overthrow the corporate government.

Features:

CLASSIC FPS GAMEPLAY – Heavily inspired by the classic FPS games of the early 90’s:  High-speed-action, circle-strafing and unloading a stream of bullets into enemies.

BUNKER BUILDING – Build and upgrade new rooms in your bunker to buff your punks, improve your economy and enable new abilities. It’s a non-linear skill tree for a wide variety of play styles.

RANDOMLY GENERATED LEVELS – Every level is generated randomly by the game. The layout is different, the enemies are different, the loot is different, even the propaganda posters on the walls are different.  You never know what’s around the next corner.

CUSTOMIZATION – Combine loot, character attributes and bunker rooms to customize each character in your Bunker Punks gang
