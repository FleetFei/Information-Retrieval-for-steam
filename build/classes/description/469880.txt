							Play Atulos Online as a Reaper or Orc.

The Reaper is an NPC in Atulos Online that is now available as a player character class. Gain a slight edge in Arena Wars and strut around the land of Atulos as death incarnate!

The Orc is also now available for selection as a player character. You'll be equipped with a sword and brace, combining the swordsmanship of the Fire Guardian with the defense of the Earth Warrior. And you'll look pretty damn stylish getting around in green.
