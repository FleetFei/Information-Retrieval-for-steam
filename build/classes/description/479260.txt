							Cuties – They are 50 colourful logical levels where you have to lead two rabbits in love through a number of obstacles. There are chasms, traps, breakable bridges and angry plants in green forests, hot deserts and even in the North Pole. The main villain is a bad pig who is on the way of the loving rabbits. Fortunately, it’s quite easy to lull its vigilance if you collect a certain number of carrots. 
Characteristics: 
- Simultaneous control of the rabbits moving mirror-imagely in opposite directions; 
- A large number of levels, that become more and more complicated; 
- Rich graphics to please the eye; 
- Constantly increasing content and new levels; 
- It’s a pleasure not only to while away the time, but to develop both cerebral hemispheres as well.
