							   Tsioque (pronounced /tsɪɒk/) is an animated adventure game inspired by classic 80s and 90s point and click titles. Craftily mixing influences of games like Day of the Tentacle, Dragon's Lair or Humongous Games' Pajama Sam, it offers its own, original narrative experience, which can be described as both dark and adorable.We take the role of a young princess Tsioque, imprisoned in a castle ruled by the Evil Wizard. At first glance, with her blond hair and big blue eyes, she may seem like your typical princess, but she's anything but typical. She doesn't wait for Prince Charming to rescue her - she rescues herself, using her wits, stubbornness, and an unusual talent for bringing unintended chaos and destruction wherever she goes.Humor? Check. Darkness? Check. Suspense? Check!
