							A comedy/sci-fi with a healthy dollop of gutteral horror. Motivational Growth features the voice of cult hero Jeffrey Combs, with Adrian DiGiovanni and Danielle Doetsch. Director/Screenwriter Don Thacker is a game designer whose resume includes Pixeljam, XGen Studios, Robot Loves Kitty, Rocketcat Games, TOO DX and fast-rising point and click shooter  Starr Mazer. The heavily video game-inflected Motivational Growth features a retro-video game inspired chiptune soundtrack by Alex Mauer. Synopsis: After a failed TV set leads to a failed suicide attempt, depressed and reclusive Ian Folivor begins taking life advice from a fungal growth in his filthy bathroom. A surprisingly smooth talking chunk of aspergillus, The Mold works to win Ianâ€™s trust by helping him clean himself up, remodel his lifestyle and, with luck, make some headway with the girl next door. When Ian begins receiving strange messages from his broken television set, however,  the reality of his restyled life begins to crumble, exposing the gruesome and disturbing world into which Ian has actually been cast.Directed by: 	Don ThackerProduced by: 	Alexis Nordling
