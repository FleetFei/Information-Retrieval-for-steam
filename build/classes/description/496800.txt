							According to the legend, an ominous entity known as The Queen of Spades can be summoned by drawing a door and staircase on a mirror in the darkness and saying her name three times. They say the Queen of Spades gets her energy from reflective objects and anyone who sees her will go insane or die. Four teenagers decide to try to conjure up The Queen of Spades as a joke. But when one of them dies suddenly, the group realizes they are up against an inexplicable and deadly evil.
