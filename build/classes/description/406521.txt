							The world of 2064 can be hard to navigate. The Sights of Neo-SF is the official art book by Read Only Memories director and lead artist John "JJSignal" James. Highly stylized and specific in its visuals, ROM's progression from early sketches to final form is fully outlined in this 26-page PDF. You will see early concepts fully realized, previous versions of your favorite characters and even some characters that didn't make the final cut. JJ lists Bubblegum Crisis, Akira, Megazone 23, and the Pluto manga as his biggest style inspirations. Come see where the ideas behind the game began and watch them evolve into the vibrant city of Neo-SF we know and love.
