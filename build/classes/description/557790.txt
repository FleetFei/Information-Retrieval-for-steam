							Marcus is an amateur archaeologist. He, as a newbie, had no chance to show his worth. He got only boring tasks. During one of these tasks he was sent to check already examined temple of Maya. No one has expected Marcus to find the secret entrance and get into the part of the ruins that any real archeologist has ever visited. He, together with you, will have to face the ancient ruins full of dangerous traps – all this to find the ancient artefact – the goblet of Maya, which, as the legend says, has a power of day and night.
