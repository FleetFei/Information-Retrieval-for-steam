
							About This Game
							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. 
In this second round of releases we offer "Nobunaga's Ambition-Nation," the second release in the series and the first to be released outside of Japan (under the name Nobunaga's Ambition). 
Players take the role of one of the main characters of the period, Nobunaga Oda, Shingen Takeda, Kenshin Uesugi, or others and try to unite the 50 kingdoms of Japan, from Ezo in the north to Kyushu in the south, under their own rule.
