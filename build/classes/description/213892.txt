							The fully unlocked “Masks of the Dimir” deck. On Ravnica, the House Dimir provides covert services that other guilds can’t or won’t, using their secrecy as both weapon and defense. Put yourself in the role of a Dimir secret-broker as you extract information from the minds of others to use as currency for your own gain. Draw upon millennia of lore in the necromantic arts to weave a web of illusions and nightmares for your enemy to stumble through. Make your opponent throw away spells and creatures while you use your mind-magic to gain card advantage and bring out the real horrors. In Additional content for Magic 2014.
