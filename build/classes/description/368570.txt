							Game producer Nekki, creator of hits like Shadow Fight 2 and Vector, presents you Beat Da Beat - a nail-biting action game to the rhythms of Dubstep tracks!

Everything that happens on the screen - movement, actions, shootings - are based on the musical composition. Can you imagine anything more awesome than dodging a rain of enemy bullets to a mighty Dubstep beat, turning the alien enemies into atoms, while dancing happily to this?
What? Punching the bad guy's face in close combat? No problem!

Wow, slow down! You wanna fight already?
Wait. You didn't think that we will let you go with this metallic lemon?
You have 10 unique spaceships at your service, with each an individual ability.
For some to unlock, you have to sweat pretty much - but it's totally worth it!
Besides this, if you're attached to your old ship already, you can upgrade it to turn it into a real machine of vengeance.

So far, we have:

- A deep written love-story, which will make you cry
- Pixelart style. You don't see this around often!
- Unbelievable musical levels
- 4 difficulty modes
- Great bosses
- Awesome music from awesome musicians
- A dancing guy in the corner. Wow!

Seriously?
You have read until the end and haven't started playing yet? So what if I tell you there are explosions? Lot's of explosions!
