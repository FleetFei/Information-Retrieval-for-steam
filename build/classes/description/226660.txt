							Crusader Kings II: Hymns to the Old Gods contains four new songs, totaling almost 12 minutes, created by the talented composer Andreas Waldetoft.


These grand songs run while playing as Norse characters to enhance the experience and atmosphere of the game. Andreas Waldetoft has been working on Paradox Development Studio games since Hearts of Iron II and Europa Universalis III.



 We Are Norse - The Norse were feared warriors who raided, explored and settled large areas of Europe, Asia and the North Atlantic islands. This song pays homage to their strength and resolve
 The City of Birka - On the island Björkö in lake mälaren, the city of Birka was one of the earliest urban settlements in Scandinavia, being founded in the middle of the 8th century. This song was written to honor one of the most important trade centers of the Viking age
 Wilderness - From the harsh winters comes the strength of the Norse. There is also great beauty in the vast wilderness of Scandinavia. This tune seeks to convey the serene beauty and spirit of the Nordic lands
 Thor - The son of Odin and the protector of mankind. With his hammer Mjölnir, he was one of the most popular gods in Norse mythology. This powerful hymn was written as a tribute to the God of Thunder and Lightning
