							Superstar Dance Club is a character-based dancing game, compatible with Konami's DDR mat controller. Show your best moves with Suzy and friends as you tap your feet (or the controller) to the music. You'll start at the local club and if you're good enough, work your way to Superstar status where you can show off your hottest dance skills in different arenas and locations. Join various different characters and create the ultimate dance sensation.
