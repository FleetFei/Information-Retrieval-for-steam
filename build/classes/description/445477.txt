							This session lets you jump straight in and drive the Southern Pacific GE CW44-9 in 'easy' or 'realistic' mode.For the full experience, select 'Realistic Mode' and start driving this beautiful locomotive!The GE C44-9W is a 4,400 hp (3,281 kW) diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems of Erie, Pennsylvania. Keeping in tradition with GE's locomotive series nicknames beginning with the Dash 7 of the 1970s, the C44-9W was dubbed the Dash 9 upon its debut in 1993. The design has since proven popular with North American railroads. Because of more stringent emissions requirements that came into effect in the United States on January 1, 2005, the Dash 9-44CW has been replaced in production by the GE ES44DC.Many North American railroads have ordered the C44-9W. They were originally ordered by Chicago & North Western Railway, Santa Fe, BNSF, CSX, Southern Pacific, Canadian National Railway, BC Rail, and Union Pacific Railroad. Norfolk Southern purchased the very similar Dash 9-40CWs.Features IncludeFull custom CabAuto Running NumbersAnimated WipersNight LightingFire ScriptCab SignalsGecko Script
