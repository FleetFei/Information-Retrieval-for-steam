							Ready to give up? 
Ready to rage? 

In 'Alien Hostage' you must complete all challenges given to you by the human scientists who have trapped you on Earth. The only way to escape and travel back to your home is by completing every single one of their challenges, every dangerous rage inducing stage. 
Each consecutive stage will become more difficult. We can guarantee that you will rage unless you can become a master at controlling your UFO. 

Collect all the props to proceed to the next stage. Buy upgrades in the human's upgrade store. 
Destroy your ship and watch it shatter into small fragments. 
Some levels have more to them than just collecting props to proceed, for example, some stages might have small puzzles you must complete. 

If you think what I've told you so far sounds hard then your going to love this next part... 
The human scientists also have specially designed super weapons to prevent you from reaching your home. 


Can you do it? 
Can you make it back Home?
