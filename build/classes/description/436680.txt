							Magic was thought long vanished from the world of Gallantia after a civil war between the ancient wizards and the armies of man. Until now....Magic vanished when the ancient wizards who ruled Gallantia were ousted by the armies of man. Knowledge of the arcane and the ones who worked the ancient Blessings were lost - buried in the sands of time.  Magic has been relegated to the realm of myth, of superstition. Yet, myths often have a basis in truth, and a chance encounter in the Eternal Forest could change the world forever.Join Violetta, the Witch of Everlasting Journeys, as she travels through an expansive fantasy setting rich in history and lore on an epic quest to discover if mankind has truly made "A More Beautiful World" in the absence of miracles.What will she find at the end of her adventure?
