							The unique background and nature of each of the seven races in the Sword of the Stars series extends beyond the star-traversing battleships and into the soundtrack thanks to the Award Winning Studio X Labs and composer Paul Ruskay.
This is the remastered and re-orchestrated soundtrack to Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, which includes a special bonus track, the Loa's theme from Sword of the Stars 2: End of Flesh. Ruskay, the musical mind behind such games as Max Payne 2, Kung-fu Chaos, Def Jam Vendetta, and the entire Homeworld series, has taken the looped tracks from in-game and expanded them out into this lush, alien soundtrack.
Let the sounds of an alien culture inspire you at the gym, relax you to sleep, or revel in the cries of your defeated enemies on the fields of battle!*
