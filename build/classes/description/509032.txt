							Before Okhlos there were Okhlos prototypes! Okhlos: Olympus Edition includes six of these amazing, half-baked prototypes from the Coffee Powered Machine archives. Try out fun but failed features like frenzied local multiplayer, stealthy mob-ness, side-scrolling mayhem and more!

Each prototype can be found in its own folder in the 'Okhlos' game folder on your PC and contain the game files, screenshots, and a readme.txt file that explains what makes each one unique. Please note that all prototype builds are PC compatible only.
