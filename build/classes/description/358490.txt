							Drip Drip is a casual strategy game with RTS inspired controls for the PC where the player is an elite drip collector and manages the Disaster Response Team. With a team of tools and water collecting and building fixing skills, travel across the USA and visit 24 exciting cities on your mission to ensure the safety of each building from the severe storms and their devastating weather conditions. 

From inside small houses to towering skyscrapers, containers like pans, buckets, and barrels will have to be moved around the floors to catch the dripping water and then be emptied to save the buildings from extreme damage, flooding, and destruction. The water dumped out of windows will earn you money so other containers and tools can be bought to keep the buildings standing while you withstand a constant barrage of pouring rain and never-ending threats like the UFO, Ghost, Witch Doctor, and Lightning Bolts during each storm cycle.
