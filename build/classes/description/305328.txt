Guitarists including Buck Owens, Muddy Waters, Albert Collins, Steve Cropper, Jeff Buckley and Jonny Greenwood have all made the Telecaster an essential component of everything from country to blues to soul to modern rock.In Doug Wamble's (Wynton Marsalis, Norah Jones) second Artist Series release, The Telecaster Sessions, he takes this classic guitar through seven complete recording sessions, each in a different tempo, style and key.  In addition, Doug uses all three pickup positions (bridge, middle and neck) to capture the full spectrum of the Telecaster's unique tone.  With a huge selection of funky rhythm loops, soulful melodies, blues-drenched lead lines, and down home pickin', The Telecaster Sessions captures Wamble's incredible touch on the guitar, allowing you to easily layer and arrange the perfect track for your next project.
