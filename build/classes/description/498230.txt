							When a mild-mannered medical officer finds himself deployed to the most worthless stretch of land in the entire galaxy, the last things he expects to find are his patients dead, a poltergeist haunting a robot, a 200-ton tank in the center of a love triangle, and an evil strain of artificial intelligence attempting to enslave all of humanity. Welcome to Blood Gulch.
