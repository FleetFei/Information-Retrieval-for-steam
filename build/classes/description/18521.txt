					Defense Grid: Resurgence Map Pack 4
					Kill Zone and Overflow - The final installment of the Resurgence series includes two more environments sure to challenge your tactical planning.  In Kill Zone, will you construct your defenses near the spiral road in, the spiral road out, or the open platform in the middle?  Perhaps all three!  But youâ€™ll need to be on your toes to deter the invaders. Overflow has numerous connected platforms that will provide countless options to turn back the enemies.  Will you be able to keep the cores safe?
