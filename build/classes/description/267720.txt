							Set amongst the heavens, the music of the Sword of the Stars games has always been one of aliens instruments and military anthems. But in The Pit you aren't in the heavens, you've entered a hell, and with it comes a dark and mechanical accompaniment! Composed and produced by Ben Lam at Power Up Audio, The Pit OST takes the retro sound of gaming eras past and heightens it with a modern, hands-on sound, making it a must-have for instrumental aficionados.Track List:BootEnter The PitForebodingEvasionMarch of the Maintenance BotsEngineer At WorkGreenhouse of the DamnedSecurity SearchStrangler StalkBeware of the BlobsWarbot ScansRise of the XombiesZuul MastersYou Lose!
