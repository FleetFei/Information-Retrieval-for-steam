							The 4 Stroke Champions and Events DLC adds a new category and 18 new challenge events! Ride the 1.000cc MotoGP™ bikes that competed between 2004 and 2006, with their powerful engines, and less electronics than today's bikes. Choose from 20 riders across 13 teams, for a total of 7 different manufacturers.The 4-Stroke challenges take their inspiration from some of the real events that took place in those years, such as the Jerez Grand Prix in 2005 with its epic struggle at the last corner between Rossi and Gibernau, the unforgettable battles between Biaggi and Rossi, and Stoner making his MotoGP™ debut.Rider and TeamLoris Capirossi	- 65 - Ducati Team – 2004	Ducati DesmosediciTroy Bayliss- 12 - Ducati Team – 2004	Ducati DesmosediciNeil Hodgson - 50 - D'Antin MotoGP - 2004	Ducati DesmosediciValentino Rossi - 46 - Yamaha Team – 2005	Yamaha M1Colin Edwards - 5 - Yamaha Team – 2005	Yamaha M1Kenny Roberts - 10 - Team Suzuki MotoGP – 2004	Suzuki GSV-RJohn Hopkins - 21 - Team Suzuki MotoGP – 2004	Suzuki GSV-RSete Gibernau - 15 - Movistar Honda MotoGp – 2005	Honda RCV 211vMarco Melandri - 33 - Movistar Honda MotoGp – 2005	Honda RCV 211vMax Biaggi - 3 - Team Honda – 2004	Honda RCV 211vNicky Hayden - 69 - Repsol Honda Team – 2006	Honda RCV 211vMakoto Tamada - 6 - JIR Konica Minolta Honda – 2005	Honda RCV 211vAlex Barros - 4 - Team Honda – 2005	Honda RCV 211vShinya Nakano - 56 - Kawasaki Racing Team – 2005	Kawasaki – ZX-RRAlex Hofmann - 66 - Kawasaki Racing Team – 2005	Kawasaki – ZX-RRCasey Stoner - 27 - Honda LCR – 2006	Honda RCV 211vRuben Xaus - 11 - Yamaha – 2005	Yamaha M1Toni Elías - 24 - Yamaha – 2005	Yamaha M1Jeremy McWilliams - 99 - Aprilia Racing - 2004	Aprilia RS CubeShane Byrne - 67 - Aprilia Racing - 2004	Aprilia RS CubeBikes and riders from the DLC can be used in offline and online Grand Prix, Championship, Time Attack, and Split Times modes.
