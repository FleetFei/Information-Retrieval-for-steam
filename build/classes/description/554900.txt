We will host closed testings before official multiplayer update; in order to avoid bugs/glitches. As of right now, this is an early access build, meaning things might not work as intended, and glitches may occur. Please do not purchase this game if you expect to play a finished product. We will refine and do our best fixing issues (bugs, glitches, etc) when they occur.
