							In 2012, Norfolk Southern celebrated its 30th anniversary and honoured some of the railroads in its history by repainting 20 locomotives in ‘fallen flag’ liveries.Since the 1820s, hundreds of railroad companies were built, merged, reorganised and consolidated into what eventually became Norfolk Southern in 1982. Each livery was modified to fit the GE ES44AC and EMD SD70ACe, while staying as true as possible to the original designs.
