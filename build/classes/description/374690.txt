
							About This Software
							RigIT is a 3D computer graphics animation tool that automatically rigs skeletons from an animation library to 3D meshes from 3D mesh libraries. RigIT is a fast, high resolution, near pose, automatic rigger that can rig skeletons to meshes with or without well-defined interiors. It allows you to import skeletons and animations from Motion Capture (.bvh) files and automatically rigs them to objects imported from Wavefront (.obj) files that contain a single object mesh.  These rigged meshes can then be exported to a Collada (.dae) file.  RigIT is designed to decrease time to market costs by reducing the time requirement for, and simplifying the process of, assigning animations to computer graphics.
