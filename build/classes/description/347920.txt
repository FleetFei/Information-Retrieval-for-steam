							Welcome to helm! Steam and Metal — scroll shooter in the steampunk world. Hordes of steam enemies and huge bosses are waiting to be destroyed. Spectacular levels of handcrafted pixels waiting for someone to pass through them. Scoundrels have killed the professor and stolen his blueprints. Only his brave daughter in an experimental steamdriven aircraft is able to avenge her father's death. When there are too many enemies — just shoot 'em all up!
