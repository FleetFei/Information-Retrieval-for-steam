							All across the world of Edolie, people are gathering to celebrate the coming of Harvest, the biggest event of the year. Feasts and dancing will mark the passing of another generous year.

For Willow it’s a chance for her to travel to a neighborhood island to watch the festivals unfold, but this is going to be a harvest unlike any that have come before.

Troubles from this magical world’s dark past and conspiring events are about to be unleashed. A discovery is made far away that will bring everyone into danger, so why does nobody care?

Discover the secrets of Edolie as you adventure with a group of new found friends, seemingly alone in their desire to discover what is going on.
