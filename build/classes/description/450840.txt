							A REALLY SHORT STORY: 

Seven days to Timothy's 13th birthday, his father dies mysteriously. Later that night while looking through his Father's stuff, Tim makes a discovery. He finds an old chest with four items: A really cool hat, a weird looking flame gun, a map and a note which read "Dear Tim, save me. Love, Dad. P.S. Wear the hat". Tim is mysteriously teleported to Hell upon wearing the hat through the old chest. He must now brave this dark world and find his dad in time for his birthday.
