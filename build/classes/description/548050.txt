							Runes is a unique puzzle game where you need to arrange the marbles in each and every level to match the picture in the upper-right corner. The less moves you use to do that, the more stars you'll earn. Each of the pieces can only move in the direction of their arrows, so your moves must be thought out and planned in order for the orbs to arrive at their designated places.
