Year One so if any of this sounds exciting take a look and we hope to hear from you in the forums!IMPORTANT: Z. Year One is a standalone product -- the entire game is included already. There are currently no plans for DLC or expansion sets, etc. More like Duels of the Planeswalker and less like Hearthstone.IMPORTANT x2: Being a tabletop card game in digital form means you'll have to read often to know what things do in Z. If you don't want to do that, you're going to have a bad time! Press TAB in-game at any time to pull up the How to Play screen!
