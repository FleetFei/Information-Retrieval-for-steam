							In Vol'Talkes, you play in the role of Captain Ben Kincaid, a Commander of the Allied Defense Force, a military organisation that was founded to protect mankind from alien attacks. With the development of so called CAIs (crystaline artificial intelligences) mankind discoveres the opporturnity to embed the personality of a human in a crystaline device and thus empower it with almost infinite computing power. Unfortunatly these CAIs are not accepted as equal individuals by the human race and so, after years of oppression by their creators, they start to rebel against them and a war begins, that will define the future of mankind in the universe. But the story is not carved in stone. On your journey with Captain Kincaid you are forced to make decisions, which will often push you in a conflict between moral and obedience and most of the time there is no real black and white, but various shades of grey. Thereby the story evolves in different directions and the type of available units and possible partners for alliances will change dramatically.Gameplay Features• more than 40 different units• hardpoint-based strike options guarantee deep tactical gameplay• no simple paper-scissor-stone mechanics• intense and long battles with hundrets of units under your command• plan your attacks in a huge galactic scale on long term objectives• 2 different game layers in real time - a strategic galaxy map and tactical battle enviroments• 5 different fractions• 2 playable fractionsSingleplayer Features• singleplayer campaign with 60-80 hours of gameplay• player decisions have an huge impact on story development and unlock different units and allies• many different side missions, that want to be found and mastered• different strategic and tactical options guarantee gameplay rich in variety• tactical use of Power-Ups• long lasting support after launch with new maps, missions and unitsMultiplayer Features• Units unlock after progress in singleplayer campaign• Unlock of powerful hero units• 2 playable fractions• different tech-trees• hardcore hero units (they die once, they're gone)• tactical buffs and debuffs• buff crafting system• huge shipyards develop new units and heroes• coop multiplayer with 4 players vs 4 NPCs• up to 4 vs 4 player battles
