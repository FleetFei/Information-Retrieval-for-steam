							In the future, some time after the success of ADMX, the full nature of dark matter is finally understood. Governments, corporations and criminals have begun to harness the benefits of this discovery. From generating electricity to the creation of designer drugs, the power of dark matter axions is harnessed in many ways. The effects of this time period are disasterous. Illness, harmful radiation and horrific mutations are widespread. Criminals commonly referred to as "bandits" fight for control of society. The military is downtrodden. The only hope left for humanity lies in the hands of scientists and mercenaries looking to solve the mysteries of the axion. You are one of the few... the remnant... what will become of you? Axion is an open world first/third person shooter with rpg and survival elements. The game is single player or multiplayer with LAN and online capability. Features include a large open world, character development and storyline in both single and multiplayer.
