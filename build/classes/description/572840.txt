							Sewer (Map Pack)What can be more exciting than getting under the city and crawling around in its waste? It’s full of joy and adventure, isn’t it?And sometimes, it’s necessary. The druid’s trees are dying. He says the roots are reaching down in the deep, right to the old sewer system that runs under the city. Something is happening down there and it would be great if you could prevent the destruction of the rare and precious trees before it’s too late.This set includes 49 sewer tiles.Requires: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and any Ruleset.
