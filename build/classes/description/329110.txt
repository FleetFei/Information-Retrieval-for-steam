THE FANS HAVE SPOKEN“This game is Awesome! Challenging and entertaining. Not just some gem or gummy game. Terrific find!”“I think this is the best "match 3" game out there. It's got a ton of RPG elements to it that makes it very deep. It reminds me a lot of Hearthstone.”“Got to love a good mix of bejeweled and magic the gathering in an app. Love it!”“Basically this game takes my favorite elements of Ascension and Hearthstone and gives them a different, and I think improved, foundation.”“My wife teases me that Gems of War is Candy Crush for boys. It's an intriguing combination of a gem game and a collectable card game. I like the campaign and the guild play.”“This is like the version of Puzzle Quest I never knew I wanted. Oodles of quests, challenges, guild activities, cool monsters, arena fights, ranked fights, and man I could just play that treasure mini game all day.”
