							The Thunderhead is walking expression of voltaic energy. Though a warjack, Thunderhead cannot be called a steamjack. This massive warjack is powered solely by voltaic energy and, as it is a combat ‘jack, that energy has also been weaponized. Thunderhead releases massive pulses of destructive electricity in wide swaths or concentrated bursts. The electromagnetic component of these energies ensures that once Thunderhead strikes a target, it can continue to arc energy through the target until it is destroyed!Behemoth embodies the national pride of the Khadoran Empire. Appropriately, it is half again as tall as any warjack in Khador’s arsenal, more heavily armored, and packs all the most sosphicated weapons Khadoran mechaniks could devise. A secondary cortex inside Behemoth’s chassis allows a pair of bombards to continuously shell the battlefield even as the great warjack closes or engages heavier targets. In close combat, Behemoth’s heavy iron fists drive into its targets aided by directional, explosive charges.Twisted engineering and evil sorcery came together to produce a unique and singularly sinister warjack. No one knows who made the Deathjack and no one knows why, but the Nightmare Empire was quick to bind the warjack into its service. Malign intelligence allows the Deathjack to use necromancy. The worst thing about the Deathjack is its ability to feed on the death to heal itself. In fact, the Deathjack can never truly be destroyed…The Avatar of Menoth came to the Harbinger of Menoth through her communing with the Creator of Man. The plans she laid out were followed diligently were followed faithfully by the faithful, and when the massive warjack was complete, no lighting of the heartfire was necessary. The Avatar roared to life as though touched by Menoth himself. The massive blade it wields, Burning Wrath, falls upon heretics and nonbelievers with unstoppable power. The unworthy cannot penetrate its massive shield and when Menoth’s Gaze falls his enemies, none can resist its power.
