							Super Cyborg is an old school non-stop hardcore run'n'gun action game! You are an elite battle cyborg who is sent in to investigate a series of anomalies on a mysterious island. The merciless and powerful alien known only as the 'Xirxul life form' has been awakened by unwitting scientists and now: all humanity is in danger!  Shoot, run and jump through 7 levels filled with endless hordes of biological terrors and some of the fiercest boss fights in any title. Destroy everything that moves on this island, because if it moves- it kills!
Are you ready to save the Earth?
