
							About This Game
							B.U.T.T.O.N. is a physical party game for 2-8 players.

						Step back away from the computer, race to the keyboard/controllers through physical space, and do whatever it takes to win (or to avoid losing). Act like a monkey, jump up and down, wrestle over the keyboard/controllers, cheat your competitors, and above all, expect the unexpected. Brutally unfair tactics are, after all, totally OK now!

						Key features:
						
						Physical, unpredictable gameplay offers something different from the typical computer game
						Perfect for family events and parties â€“ move around, compete, and enjoy! 
						Four players can play simultaneously on only one controller, or eight players on only two controllers
						Tons of different tasks and challenges keep the game fresh and unpredictable 
						Award-winning indie sensation, showcased at IndieCade and finalist for the Nuovo Award at the 13th Annual Independent Games Festival
