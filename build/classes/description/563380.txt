
							About This Game
							Shadows is a puzzle-based platformer taking place in a mysterious, silhouetted world. Your goal is to construct a beacon of light to call for help and find your way home. Along the way, you will be able to discover pieces of your past, memories lost after your arrival in the caves. Fireflies will be your guiding light; without them you will enter into the darkness of the caves never to return. 

Constructing the beacon and finding your way home will not be so simple, however: you'll face jumping puzzles, runic riddles, challenges of darkness, among many others in order to find the parts of the beacon. You will have to seek out what is needed: an orb, a large crystal, a small crystal, the base of the beacon, and a refractor. Along the way, you are also tasked to collect 50 fireflies that will illuminate the orb and give the beacon its light. Fireflies, however, will depart over time and, if you're not careful, you will perish in the darkness.
