							Gideon Jura’s fully unlocked “Wielding Steel” white deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Strong. Heroic. Gallant. Gideon is accurately portrayed as all these things, but to him they are just words. Only his actions carry meaning, and his strong morals and sense of duty lead him to take action frequently in defense of justice. His deck emphasizes the strength of a coordinated, well-equipped army. With brave Soldiers and majestic Angels working in tandem, the unruly forces of chaos won’t stand a chance.
