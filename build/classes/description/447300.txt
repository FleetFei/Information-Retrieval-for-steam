							Tired of hunting around the city, trying to find characters to unlock? Then this pack is for you!

This pack will unlock 5 additional starting characters for the game, without you having to locate them first. The characters are:

1. Alice Wazcheck
   A very fit yoga teacher who starts with 20 extra snacks! She begins the game to the far right of the map, near the mayor's mansion.

2. Joan Dartsmith
   A sewage worker who starts in the sewers directly beneath the gunshop, oh yeah! She also gets a sewer access card!

3. Clive Mackersdonger
   Starts with a hospital key-card and just outside the Eastern entrance to the hospital. 

4. Hannah Greatford
   A car mechanic that starts with the fuel siphoner. A great character for crafting as she's never short on fuel!

5. Roger Grubberwick
   Poor old Roger! Not much better than the starting characters but does get a lot of random crafting supplies to start with.

Even with these characters unlocked you still get the fun of locating the last 3, and best, starting characters, although it will be much easier now you have access to new parts of the map! Good Luck!
