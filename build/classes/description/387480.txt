							Told with courageous humor and unflinching candor, cancerpants tells the story of spirited and self-aware 36-year-old Austinite Rochelle “Ro” Poulson’s battle to stay strong after an unexpected diagnosis of stage III breast cancer. Unfolding in intimate diary style cancerpants charts Ro and her partner Julie’s emotional odyssey as they engage their entire circle of friends, family and local community to aid Ro’s quest to find meaning, life enrichment and personal growth. Ro refuses to be “just a body,” and throughout the film she demonstrates how to sustain a constructively fighting spirit within the experience of serious illness. We watch her undergo chemo, a (failed) lumpectomy, a double mastectomy, radiation and a brain tumor scare. Taking charge, reflecting on her choices, maintaining her connection to others, celebrating her expanding mindfulness and self-awareness, Ro embodies a mindful warrior throughout her breast cancer experience, lending strength to all those who share her journey, inspiring confidence and trust. Through Ro’s searingly honest and courageous voice this film connects all those touched by and fearful of breast cancer, arming viewers with insights into the experience that will dispel fears and help women face the reality of breast cancer and its impact. Although breast cancer will be a part of Ro for the rest of her life, she doesn't see cancer as a curse. Ro discovers no finite answers when it comes to cancer, but Ro hopes cancerpants will generate awareness and play a role in finding a cure.
