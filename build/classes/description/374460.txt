							The 1970's and 80's were a golden time for video games. Impossiball pays homage to one of the original greats of that era, but with a 21st century update.The aim is to score as many points as you can by getting balls past your opponent, whilst stopping as many as possible from getting past you. By rotating your ship you have fine control over the direction balls will bounce. The first player to reach the score limit wins. There is a variety of Power-Ups and 'game changers' like Magnet, Invisiball, Inversion, Shield and Impossiball to make your game easier, or your opponent's game harder.Time-tested, classic game-play upgraded with 500 balls on screen and 3D graphics. You can try to beat the AI (with three difficulty levels) or challenge a friend.We have drawn inspiration from Pong (of course) as well as Geometry Wars, Speedball, Break Out and Arkanoid among others.As of version 0.1 (released on 22 November 2016), there are now two different game-modes to choose from: the classic IMPOSSIBALL as described above and the new DODGEBALL which, as its name suggests, requires you to avoid the balls as they get faster and bigger!
