							The official soundtrack of the indie horror game, Quadrant!
This OST features nearly 30 tracks from composers Matt Caradus and Otus Hobst. Included are all soundtrack songs and ambient tracks used in the game.
Bringing you their very best, Matt and Otus have created a truly dynamic and textured soundtrack; a perfect compliment to Quadrant, but can stand on it's own as a great piece of work!
