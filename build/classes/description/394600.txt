							Get ready for a blast from the 8-bit past with the all-new 2D action/platforming game, MIGHTY GUNVOLT! A loving nod to the retro side-scrollers of the late '80s, MIGHTY GUNVOLT offers simple controls, cute and colourful graphics, and a surprising amount of complexity and fun.
Play as one of three characters: Gunvolt, the star of Azure Striker GUNVOLT; Ekoro, an angel from Japan's Gal*Gun series; or Beck, the hero of Mighty No. 9. Each character possesses unique skills that will allow players to keep challenging each stage in new and creative ways!
