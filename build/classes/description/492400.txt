With loads of unlockable costumes, perks, and characters, Thunder Gun: Revenge of the Mutants will keep you playing for hours while you master its insane difficulty, comboing, chaining, and rocket-jumping.FeaturesFear the gameâ€™s punishing, old-school DifficultyBe rewarded by an XP system that values skill over grindingUnlock loads of Characters, Costumes, and PerksBattle on different Maps, each with their own obstacles to overcomeKeep matches fresh with Endless and 5-Minute play modesSupreme controllability with both Mouse/Keyboard and Gamepad supportWhippings are inevitableSoundtrackThe Thunder Gun: Revenge of the Mutants Soundtrack was written and created by Mike LeRoy specifically for the game and can be purchased at his Bandcamp Page.
