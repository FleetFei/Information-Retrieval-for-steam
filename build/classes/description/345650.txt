
							About This Game
							Vinty has been getting nowhere with her calligraphy. Her confidence has sunk to an all time low.
As life pressures her toward giving up, will she forget why she pursued this craft in the first place? 

Without Within is a short visual novel that explores the creative mind. The game was released for free in Christmas 2014 as thanks to everyone for supporting my endeavors thus far. For those who kindly appreciate the experience and wish to make a contribution, there is an Extra Edition DLC that includes the soundtrack, a digital artbook, as well as three inspirational chase cards.

Unfortunately, being a free game, Without Within is unable to feature trading cards. Sorry Vinty!

Thank you! I hope you will enjoy the read.
