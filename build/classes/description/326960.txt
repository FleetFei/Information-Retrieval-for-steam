							In a free, add-on mod for Killing Floor, created by David Hensley (with help from Killing Floor originator, Alex Quick), you can fight off the bizarre and warped toys of someone's nightmare, that are hell-bent on finishing you off. All the standard Zeds are replaced with evil toys, set in the Devil's Dollhouse map.
