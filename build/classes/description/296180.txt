							Western Germany, March 1964... The last Great War rages on. Madness at the front lines. Men butchering each other.  War-torn Europe stands ripped apart by a front line that runs straight through the heart of Germany where American and Western European troops battle against enemy forces.  An eternal war seemingly with no end in sight. Opposing forces mercilessly attack with unrelenting force, claiming small victories one day only to lose them the next.  As Lieutenant James Anderson you must infiltrate and destroy key enemy positions deep behind enemy lines. If successful, your mission could finally put a stop to the carnage and restore what everybody has long since forgotten about: peace. Inspired by real-world events and elements from WWI, WWII and modern warfare, Iron Storm brings the carnage!
