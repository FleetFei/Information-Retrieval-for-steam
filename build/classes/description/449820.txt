							The player assumes the role of a dangerous and powerful girl known as SCP-029. After a facility wide power outage occurs, numerous SCPs breach containment and proceed to wreak havoc throughout the facility. SCP-029 must use her mind-controlling powers to survive and find a way to escape from the facility.

We wanted to incorporate some of the SCP favorites like SCP-173 and SCP-106. To that end we opted to set "Daughter of Shadows" in the same facility as "SCP: Containment Breach." Beyond the physical location of the facility and a few SCPs, "Daughter of Shadows" is designed to be an entirely new experience. Most of the emphasis is on the introduction and discovery of new SCPs.
