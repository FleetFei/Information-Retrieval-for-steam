							[p]The shadow of the mighty Galactus approaches Earth! His herald, the Silver Surfer, has discovered our lush planet and called the ruler of the Power Cosmic, who is already on his way. A menace to the entire galaxy, Galactus wants to consume the Earth by converting it into pure energy. Only the Fantastic Four can face this challenge, as only they have enough power to obtain the Ultimate Nullifier and with it coerce the ruler of the Power Cosmic to depart. But before the Fantastic Four can meet with Galactus, they have to deal with Doctor Doom and his Doombots, invading Skrulls, and much more.
