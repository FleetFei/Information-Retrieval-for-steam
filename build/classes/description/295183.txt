							You must own the EWS & Freightliner Class 08s Loco Add-On before you will be able to use this add-on. If you check in the in-game store it will verify if you own it before you purchase. 

The Class 08 was the ‘go to’ locomotive for general purpose duties, with almost any shunting required in yards and at stations carried out by a ‘Gronk’. Over a ten year period from 1952, almost 1,000 models were built at British Railways’ Derby, Crewe, Darlington, Doncaster and Horwich Works, making it the most numerous of all BR classes. 

This pack presents the Class 08 in its RES livery and consists of two variations that represent a couple of configurations of toolboxes and so forth on the sides of the locomotives.
