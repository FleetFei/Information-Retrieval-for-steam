							Arena: Cyber Evolution is free to play and we want it to stay this way forever. We believe that it should be at the core of any sport to be accessible for everyone to play and practice no matter what.As an independent game studio, we however need some money to keep developing the game and improving it.  This is why we integrated monetization features in the game with the possibility to buy skins, hats and other customization items with real money.  For us, this is a simple way to allow players who really enjoy and believe in the game to support its continued development by ‘’donating’’ and receiving rewards for it.All the money received this way will be used to fuel the game development.
