							Known to chainsaw-wielding loggers around the world as ‘limbing’, the art of stripping felled trees of their branches is exciting, but very dangerous. Welcome to Limberjack — a secluded training site where you can pursue your dream of breaking into the World Logging Championships to become the undisputed greatest limber alive.

The game confronts you with a similar challenge that faces contestants in the real-world championships. You stand right by the trunk of a tree, grip your Husqvarna chainsaw with your control, and start sawing away against the clock. Compete with yourself or others, picking up the techniques used by the pros as you go along, and discovering the best way to finish quickly without getting in harm’s way.
