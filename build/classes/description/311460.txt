							Flexstyle has assembled a special arranged version of all the music from Trace Vector into a rocking soundtrack!We didnâ€™t just dump the game files into an album and call it a day. Instead, Flexstyle has taken the morphing layered music from the game and mixed them into 13 tracks (34:08) of remastered beats that are a pleasure to listen to! All the music from the game is in there with some subtle added flairs that will make you want to shoot laser beams from your eyes and do a light speed slingshot around Jupiter into deep space!Tracklist: 1: All Systems Go - 2:13 2: The Cosmic Void - 2:09 3: Realm of Chaos - 2:11 4: Bittersweet Nebula 2:38 5: The Mysterious Tear 2:46 6: Strange Space 2:19 7: Electromagnetic 2:28 8: Incomplete Promise 2:58 9: Withering of Energy - 2:5010: The Unsettling Calm - 2:1711: A Strange Feeling - 2:5712: A New Beginning - 4:1113: Trace Vector Title Screen - 2:11Total run time: 34:08Encoded in MP3 320kbps variable bit rate
