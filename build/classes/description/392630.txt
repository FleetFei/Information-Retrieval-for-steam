The young Takechiyo Matsudaira who was captured and held as a hostage by the Oda clan will later grow up to become Ieyasu Tokugawa. As a hostage, he came to know Kipposhi, the child name of a young Nobunaga Oda. 10 years later, after Nobunaga achieved his near miraculous victory at Okehazama, and Ieyasu had revived the failing Matsudaira clan, these two become trusted allies and create a grand drama that claimed a place in the history of conquerors.
