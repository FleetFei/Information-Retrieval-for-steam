							Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 50 Cent give gripping performances in this non-stop action-thriller. Stallone stars as Ray Breslin, the world's foremost expert on high-security prisons. But when he's framed for a crime and thrown into a cutting-edge, ultra-secret facility he designed, he must recruit a fellow inmate (Schwarzenegger) to help him bust out of the escape-proof facility.
