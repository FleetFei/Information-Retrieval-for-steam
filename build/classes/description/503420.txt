							Duany (protagonist) traveled aimlessly through the roads of the Akaf desert. 
He feels a strange sensation, a bang happens and suddenly his bike stops working. Duany walks to a close gas station to ask for help, and encounters a strange man who introduces himself as Marley. He says a gang has just ransacked the station and they took everything!
Marley offers Duany a great reward to retrieve a special item the assailants took, and running out of options, he ends up accepting it without knowing what he was getting into in a big trouble.
