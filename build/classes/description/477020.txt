							“The Lion’s Song: Episode 3 – Derivation” dives into the scientific world at the beginning of the 20th century – an era of great achievements, but also dark downfalls. On the eve of World War I mathematician Emma Recniczek enters the academic stage to solve a problem revolving around “change”. In order to discuss her theory with like-minded people Emma tries to gain access to a gentlemen’s club of famous mathematicians. As her request is denied because of her being a woman, she decides to disguise as a man. Will this metamorphosis help Emma shed light on the problem at the centre of her theory? Will Emil be able to prevail in the circle of leading mathematicians of his time? Moreover, can she maintain her disguise or will it collapse when put to the test? The choices players make in this episode will have a direct impact on the storylines of all future and past episodes, connecting The Lion’s Song to one overarching narrative. The decisions made will ultimately determine if the protagonists find the success they are working for.Please take also a look at the other episodes from The Lion's Song:http://store.steampowered.com/app/477030
