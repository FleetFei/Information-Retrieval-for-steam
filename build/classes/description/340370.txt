
							About This Game
							Carol has written a book about one of her previous adventures. She has put a lot of work into it, but after receiving rejections from several publishers, her enthusiasm for the project is beginning to wane. 

Her hope is somewhat rekindled when a publisher who recently rejected her book sends her an SMS, telling Carol that he wants to meet her. 

However, the publisher is not interested in Carol’s writing skills, but in her aptitude for locating missing persons. He wants to hire her to find a missing eccentric author. 

Its obvious to Carol from the very beginning that it’s not an average missing person case. The author’s wife was murdered 6 years ago. Just before his disappearance, a young woman was found murdered, with pages from the author’s latest book stuffed into her mouth.
