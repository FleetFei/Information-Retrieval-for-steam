							Ever been so moved by something that has no physical properties? Only the most pure of all auditory sensations can so strongly alter a human's emotion. THis. is exactly the kind of effect the masterful vibrational manipulations known as the Ticket Original Soundtrack (Ticket OST) has. Once entered the brain through yoru audio receptors (ears), you are not yourself anymore. You are nothing. You, there is no, "you". you are everything, all is one, one is you, you is nothing. Nirvana is reached. Thank you.Tracklist:1. Fanfare2. Ticket3. File Select4. Yellow Map5. A World of Minor Differences6. Caneen7. Grocery Store8. Dr. Drop It9. Campfire10. Old Man's Brain11.
