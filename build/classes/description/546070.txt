							Flower arrangement has a long history in many cultures.  When I decided to simulate things using program codes, I found that flowers are the best topic. The combinations of colors and shapes are so peaceful, free, and beautiful.  And unlike traditional games, I want to show you rich feeling with simple operations. For virtual plants the shapes and colors are freely adjustable, they are "living things" full generated and controlled by program codes.For more my stuff (Algorithmic Art) : http://guojun-pan.artistwebsites.com
