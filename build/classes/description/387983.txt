							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Overdrive expansion.Professor Milton Yoolip has made many inventions, but his best work is quite possible a fully-sentient robot that mimics his every move. Whenever duty calls but Yoolip would rather spend his time tinkering on new gadgets or go to the park with his granddaughter, he sends Clockwork Yoolip to take his stead. Few people even notice the difference, given the Professors eccentric personality and the many tools he usually carries around.This DLC contains a custom skin for Professor M. Yoolip in Awesomenauts!
