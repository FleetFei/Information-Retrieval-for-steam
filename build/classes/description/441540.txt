							Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and Dead Gentlemen Productions continue the epic and hilarious story of dyslexic wizard Perf and his attempt to rid himself of a sword of prophecy that has brought down assassins, barbarian kings, and severe bad breath upon him and his party. Featuring guests stars Fran Kranz (Cabin in the Woods) and Bob Sapp (Conan), this movie-length cut of Season Two increases the stakes, the humor, and the humanity that made JourneyQuest a worldwide cult hit.
