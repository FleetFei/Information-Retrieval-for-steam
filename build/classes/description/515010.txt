							A Duel Hand Disaster: Trackher is a split-screen single player twin stick risk 'em up where you control two ships simultaneously. Your primary goal is to get the highest score possible, however the only way to keep your score is to leave the level with it. Playing till death will result in a zero score and a wipe of your leaderboard progress; that is if you had one to begin with ;)Every consecutive successful run will not only require a wager of your previous score but will also unlock a new tier with new challenges and a higher base score multiplier. If you reach your wager, upon a successful extraction, you will earn your wager as a bonus. You may leave before reaching the wager but you will not receive the bonus.
