							This DLC is only available to purchase in the USA.The SW1500 is a classic example of a US yard switcher, and the different colour schemes and variants included in this add-on make it ideal for all your switching operations in Train Simulator.Built by the General Motors Electromotive Division as a replacement of the SW1200, the SW1500 was intended for switching duties, but was capable of light short line work as a road switcher. It was a development of the SW1200 and previous SW-series switchers dating back many years earlier, and was fitted with a 1500 horsepower two-stroke V-12 diesel engine. A total of 808 examples were built from 1966 to 1974, serving industrial and railroad operators across the length and breadth of the United States, with approximately a quarter of the whole production initially purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad. A huge number of SW1500s can still be found in use today, proving the durability and versatility of this old locomotive design. The SW1500 for Train Simulator includes different variants and liveries making it as versatile as the real thing.includes:SW1500 Switcher in the following liveries: Union Pacific, Southern Pacific, BNSF, Burlington Northern, Norfolk Southern ‘Lines’, Norfolk Southern ‘Horse’, Frisco, Western Pacific, Southern and Canadian National.Scenarios2 scenarios for the  Cajon Pass  (Barstow-San Bernadino), also available on SteamMobile Switcher A Grand Day Cutting
