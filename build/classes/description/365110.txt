							Once upon a time, an evil Demon Lord ruled the world. Your whole life has been spent training for the moment you and your companions could defeat the Demon Lord and save the world. Wielding incredible power, your victory is almost certain. However, after Good triumphs, what happens to you and your young friends? The rest of the land will hail you as heroes, certainly, but what happens with youth who have that much power? Will you grow depressed with the lack of challenge life presents? Will you bask in the adulation of the public but become lazy and gluttonous? Will you enslave the weak and become the next Demon Lord? Or will friendship, love, and all that sappy nonsense nevertheless save the day again?
