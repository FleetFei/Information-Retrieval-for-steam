							As you slowly regain consciousness your eyes begin to focus on your surroundings. You find yourself alone in an unfamiliar room with no memory of how you came to be there. Moonlight streams through a small barred window illuminating the musty stale air. How long have you been here? Worn stone steps lead up to a wooden door, you grip the cold metal handle and turn but it’s locked from the other side - are you a prisoner? can you escape?

Prepare to explore a mysterious manor house and the fog shrouded moors which encompass it. Solve puzzles and search for clues to discover the manor’s secrets and ultimately escape from Darkmoor.
