							About FIGHTING SPACE is a classic horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up game with staggering hectic gameplay (in a good way!), smashing soundtrack, all in an aesthetic reminiscent of titles of the DOS shareware hype during the 90’s. Set in the vague far future, as part of the Confederate Fleet, players take the role of different elite pilots and must fight their way through a conflict-ridden solar system by the name of Hell’s Kitchen, to restore order and repel an otherworldly invasion. On their journey to the very origin of the intruders, they must use their cunning, reflexes and firepower to succeed. The fleet’s shipyard allows them ship upgrading and customization with cash earned and technologies found. But make no mistake! With each planet liberated, the challenges get only tougher and the stakes higher.
