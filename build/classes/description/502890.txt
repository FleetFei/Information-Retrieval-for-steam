							Fly the legendary P-40E! It was called the Kittyhawk by the Soviets and the British, but the Americans dubbed it the Warhawk. Regardless of the name, the P-40 was the most mass-produced fighter by the US during WWII with many being used by the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act.The P-40 puts up a tough fight and is interesting to fly. It's particularly notable for its powerful armament of six .50 cal. machine guns. An enemy fighter won't last long against the P40’s massive firepower. The P-40's dimensions are much larger when compared to German and Soviet fighter planes. It gives the pilot some extra room and provides for more armored protection for its pilot. However, its size makes it bigger target. Stay vigilant and check your six often!Armament: 6 x wing-mounted Browning M2 .50 cal.
