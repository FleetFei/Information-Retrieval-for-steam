							The fully unlocked “Sylvan Might” deck. Take command of elvish forces who want nothing more than to drive out interlopers from their woodland sanctuaries. Control forest creatures both magical and mundane as you wake the woods to crush your enemies, leaving only their bones as a wanning to future trespassers. Everything is interconnected in nature, so watch your elves work together like a lethal symphony of smackdown as they power each other up and take apart your opponent in a whirl of blades. Additional content for Magic 2014.  Requires Magic 2014 Expansion.
