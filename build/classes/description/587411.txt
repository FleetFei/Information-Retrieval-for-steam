However, all characters themselves, current and future – forever, are included in this pack and will come with 1 (one) Bronze skin.In addition to characters, players who purchase this pack will receive a 5% XP bonus which includes all in-game players as well. This bonus stacks, meaning that if all 8 players in the game have this pack everyone one will receive a 40% bonus – this is also compatible with the Golden Founder’s pack as well, meaning that if 4 players have the Golden Founder’s pack and 4 have the Silver, all players will receive an XP bonus of 60% at the end of the game.
