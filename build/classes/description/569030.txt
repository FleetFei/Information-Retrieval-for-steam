							Experience the world of video games brought to life in this recording of the audience-interactive show "Heroes Must Die!" 

When player against player combat is introduced to their world, can heroes survive when they are turned against each other? Don't just find out, but watch as audiences control the action as players of the game and see monsters, magic, and gameplay live - even a gigantic, interactive dungeon set.

And play the prequel story in the RPG Heroes Must Die, for free on Steam! - http://store.steampowered.com/app/464050
 
"Heroes Must Die" is a unique video game and theater hybrid project by playwright and game designer Rick Stemm. It is a video game first, a story-driven RPG available here on Steam. The sequel is a live theatrical performance that the audience can interact with like a video game, controlling characters and changing the plot. Audience interactions, puppetry, and stagecraft will bring the world of video games to life! Both game and show are stand-alone, but experiencing both tells a story across two wholly different media.

Total run time - 1 hour, 16 min.
