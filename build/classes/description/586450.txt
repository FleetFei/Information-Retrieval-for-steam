							HIKIBYOU2 is an action/adventure platfomer with puzzle and stealth elements. A bit of what differentiates itself from the first title in the series, Hikikomori No Chuunibyou, is this successor's less realistic approach and more atmospheric vibe. Levels are once again open-ended with the story directing the player.Features:Open-ended levels with story-focused progressionVarious platforming challenges and puzzlesUnlimited continues and frequent checkpointsPixel-art graphics and electronic soundtrackSupports Xbox 360 Controller (recommended)
