							The ‘bodysnatching’ Class 57/0 in Freightliner livery is now available for Train Simulator.The Class 57/0 was introduced as a rebuilt version of the redundant Class 47, and externally both classes look the same. Internally, the Class 57/0 received a refurbished General Motors engine, reconditioned alternator, and their performance and reliability was vastly improved. This was considered to be a much more cost effective way to replace the Class 47 than to introduce a new class of diesel locomotive altogether.An initial order for six Class 57/0s from Freightliner in 1997 saw the ‘Bodysnatchers’ employed on heavy haulage freight services, including intermodal trains, and further orders steadily increased the company’s fleet.  Although not at first, later models of the Class 57/0 were fitted with an electric train supply (ETS), making them attractive acquisitions for passenger companies such as Virgin and First Great Western.The Class 57/0 for Train Simulator, developed by Oovee Entertainment, is available in Freightliner livery and features illuminating dial and cab lights, train length system, working roof fans, dynamic exhaust smoke, Driver’s Vigilance Device, Advisory Notification System, and scenery assets including temporary speed restriction boards, emergency indicator boards and temporary AWS magnets.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Freightliner Class 57/0 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
