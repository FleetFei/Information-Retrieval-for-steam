
							About This Game
							More than a game, Autumn is a relaxing place for spiritual learning and growth with a soothing atmosphere.

In each game you play as a Spirit which depends on the natural world for its progress in life. As you help the world around you to thrive, you receive vital energy(Prana) in return. During the Autumn season, while the trees are shedding their leaves, orbs of Prana are released into the air, which you can absorb. Your own Prana can be utilized to help and change the world around you and to obtain spiritual teachings.

More than levels, puzzles or in-game progressions, Autumn’s focus is on the growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the chair.

There are no time limits, no enemies to defeat, no goals to reach… except the ones you set for yourself. Relax, learn, grow… and enjoy Autumn.
