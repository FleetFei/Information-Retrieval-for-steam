
							About This Game
							Elisabeth Faust was attending her father's funeral.
Father had left her sorrow, depression, and an antiquated house.
She walked into the building and followed a black cat down to the basement.

Darkness suddenly claimed her sight.
A purple demon materialized out of nowhere, smiling like they were old friends.
The person she’d come to find was nowhere to be found.
There was a sweet fragrance in the house.

"I’ll show you the way out if you really want to leave."

Thus the crayon illustrated story began,
but she couldn’t tell if this was memory or imaginary.

“But if at any moment, you wax nostalgic about your time here, 
or wish to preserve any instant for eternity, you lose. ”


Candlestick in hand, she now has to seize the faintest trail to escape from this nightmare.
