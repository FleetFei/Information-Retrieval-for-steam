							This DLC includes a soundtrack to the game RunRabbitRun. It was composed by a great person, Nikita Voznesenskiy, aka Spaceman. And this nickname really suits him. If you need a proof, just listen to the album he's been working on for a year and a half.
Apart of original tracks featured in RunRabbitRun, this pack includes a few more tracks composed for the game, which were not used in the final build for some reason. However we find them terrific - aggressive, varied and stirring.
Just check it yourself =)
