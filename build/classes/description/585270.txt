							HeapVR is a block stacking experience with two game modes.

1st Game Mode: Stack blocks into a tower as high as you can while floating blocks attempt to interrupt your progress in a reverse Jenga-like game.

2nd Game Mode (Coming Soon): Casually snap blocks together in free-play to build any 3D structure you can imagine.
