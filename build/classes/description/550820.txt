							Hearken back to the days of Flash games and resume humanity's urge to fire kittens out of cannons. Except this time, it's all about firing them off into space at *evil* flying horses. Well, maybe they're not evil. We don't know. Honestly, we don't care. Here are the great things you can expect: Not that hard! Low playtime! Low replayability value! Gravity in space? But the gravity doesn't affect the horses?! What are those planets there for if you can't hit them?!?! DOESN'T MATTER. KITTENS. IN. CANNONS.
