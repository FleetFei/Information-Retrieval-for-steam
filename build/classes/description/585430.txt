							Flatspace IIk is a top-down space trading game with the emphasis on free exploration. In Flatspace, you choose your profession and are given a small spaceship with a scattering of random weapons, then you are free to earn a living, explore, hunt, trade, grow; upgrading your ship and equipment, eventually buying ships with crew members, and discovering the game's many secrets. Each game is different, with an intelligent random universe, populated by thousands of intelligent ships.

Influences include classic space-trading games like Elite, and RPG Dungeon Crawlers like Nethack.
