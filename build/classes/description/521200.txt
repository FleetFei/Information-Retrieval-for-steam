							Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is a silly turn-based JRPG, full of useless NPCs, rabid cats, childish humor, unreasonably large weapons, anime boobs, and other nonsense. It's a hefty adventure with over 10 hours of content and hundreds of items to collect. If you enjoy Epic Battle Fantasy 3, the story continues in the sequel and spinoff games:http://store.steampowered.com/app/265610http://store.steampowered.com/app/412670
