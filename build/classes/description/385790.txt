But is it really the end?Join one man as he travels the world in order to unravel the truth behind these tragic events."Features: Classic JRPG gameplay. A refreshing take on the random battle system that rewards grinding, or allows you to skip fighting altogether. Over a dozen side quests, many of which utilize a “fast travel” turn-in system.​ Over 40 in-game achievements.​ A simple, but tiered crafting system with over 100 craftable items. Some customizable stat growth via the augment system.​ Semi-randomized loot that encourages exploration. Controller support with JoyToKey (Windows) (other software might work too, but not tested).Note: By default, the game will run in a window. You can drag the edges to make it larger, or use ALT+ENTER to get into full screen.
