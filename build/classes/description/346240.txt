							Gameplay mechanicsThe core gameplay mechanics of Ski Park Tycoon lie in ski lift and slope construction. Before building a park, the player needs to study the mountain topography and terrain. Therefore, it was imperative to allow the player complete freedom of camera movement. Building lifts and slopes is as easy as drawing lines on the ground. Skiers coming to the resort want to enjoy their stay so - apart from lifts and slopes - the player also needs to provide other infrastructure such as restaurants, ski patrols, snow cannons etc. This is where the economic simulation aspect of the game comes into play.
