							Now hear this — Vulcan Productions and Show of Force are unleashing WE THE VOTERS, a collection of short films that offers quirky takes on the issues that define our generation — student debt, inequality, healthcare, immigration, media polarization, and more. 

Young people will build the future, and we deserve high-quality information that helps cut through the noise and make sense of the things that really matter. So we’ve recruited an awesome team of filmmakers, celebrities and comedians to take a fresh look at today’s hot topics. It’s wit, insight and analysis without any of the BS! Explore the dark heart of D.C. with MTV reporter Josh Horowitz, get the scoop on local elections from comedian and YouTube superstar Grace Helbig, join our Student Debt Game Show for a chance to win a more vibrant America, follow a day in the life of a first-time, twenty-something politician, plus lots more. 

We know what you’re thinking, we’ve thought it too — Why does it matter? Well, do you know what happens when would-be voters don’t know the basic principles and players that drive our democracy? They don’t vote — Only a third of eligible voters cast a ballot in the 2014 midterm elections, the lowest turnout in 72 years! When we don’t vote our voices don’t get heard. A true democracy only works when people participate. And that doesn’t mean simply voting, but understanding the issues. 

WE THE VOTERS is a one-stop, non-partisan resource that’ll spark interesting conversations and help you make informed decisions about the issues that matter most.
