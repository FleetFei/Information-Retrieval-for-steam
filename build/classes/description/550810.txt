							Urban myths about Abduction Bit:Abduction Bit was originally released in 1982 but considerated too realistic (or inconvenient) for publishing it like an arcade game and so to bring it to the masses, this game reveals the truth about alien abduction. Fortunately the SEEP team have found a prototype suite of arcade versions and are working on it.Story:Two aliens must catch many humans for some experiments in four stages: construction, hotel, military base and laboratory.To catch the humans the aliens use a sci-fi gun that paralyses the target for a number of seconds, during which time they destroy their memory so they cannot remember the incident. Once the humans are caught they are shaved and stripped of their clothes to be teleported to the UFO.Gameplay:Abduction Bit is a retro style game inspired by 80s arcade games like Bubble Bobble and Mario Bros, where players take control of an alien that must abduct the humans.To complete a stage the players must capture all the humans without touching them and must avoid dangerous traps. The player can jump on the platform and shoot - easy gameplay with high-level difficulty.Level Packs system:In Abduction Bit the player can select various level packs through the main menu. We'll release more packs in the future like FREE DLC.Features:100% Retro look and retro soundLocal CO-OP (2 players)Level packs with different play (and Free DLC).Customize the palette of your alienSave stateAchievementsCheap priceSteam trading cards
