							PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS IS AN OLDER DEMO, SO YOU MAY RUN INTO ISSUES NOT REFLECTED IN THE MAIN GAME This is the first 40 mins of 'Albino Lullaby', a horror adventure game that doesn't rely on jump scares or gore. A Lynchian psychological nightmare where you play as yourself trying to escape from a dark and surreal Victorian town that clings to the precipices of underground cliffs. The gamespace dynamically twists and contorts around you in real time, as you unravel an equally twisted narrative. Discover the hidden spaces haunted by 'The Grandchildren' as you uncover clues to understanding just where and what you are. Albino Lullaby is set for initial release on the PC and will be fully VR compatible.Developed by Ape Law. To make game for to give to man!
