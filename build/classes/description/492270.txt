Naturally, she takes her best friend Porfirio with her.For an urban cat, the village is a nightmare! Instead of pillows and blankets you get a pile of straw in the barn; instead of canned cat food on schedule you have to search for something to eat. And those terrible local cats could upset anyone... but not Porfirio!
