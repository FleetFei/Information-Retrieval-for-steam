We have made the game as accessible as possible for local co-op play allowing for multiple ways to play using a keyboard and controllers, or a combination of both.No single player?Both characters can technically be controlled simultaneously on your keyboard, however the game is specifically designed for cooperative local play between two people. The devs have become skilful at playing solo to test Putty Pals, so if you like a challenge, give solo play a shot with the keyboard! We would love to hear the results.
