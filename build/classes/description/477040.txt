Each of those is an exceptional mind and the game draws players into a story of personal struggle for creativity, human connections and inspiration: a talented composer suffering from writer's block just before her breakthrough concert, an up-and-coming painter growing through his challenges and a brilliant mathematician trying to make her voice heard in a men's world. The choices players make in "The Lion’s Song" will have a direct impact on the storylines of all episodes and ultimately determine if the protagonists do find the success they are working for.Please get the full package of The Lion's Song here:http://store.steampowered.com/app/477030
