							Welcome to Death by Game Show. A game of pop culture, decision making chaos and hidden parodies starring U.H.Wutt. A lead-footed tub of goo sentenced to rehabilitation in a time of droid tyranny and human ignorance.Become the smarts behind Wutt’s rehabilitation, or as the fine print calls it “kidnap-come-illegal-trial-leading-to-banishment-and-death-sentence”. Fight back against the tyranny, free the minds of humanity and find freedom-for-all! Twitch Strategy - Death by Game Show puts survival and success into your own hands. It’s not about power but how resourceful and reactive you can be.  Can you think your way to victory?
