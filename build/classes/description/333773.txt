This art pack is one of our several Platformer themed art packs. It is compatible with the others for scale, character part images, and character construction for the main player character. It also shares some identical animation data as well as some image data so that no matter which Platformer Pack you choose, you'll have a solid foundation of essential animations.
Due to the shared content of these Platformer Packs, once you've purchase any one of them be sure to review the content of any additional Platformer Pack you plan to purchase to assess what new content you would be receiving.Special thanks to Bensound for trailer song.
