							Note to Oculus Rift users: The game requires tracked controllers, so you'll need Touch controllers to play. The game can accommodate forward-facing setups, but you'll ideally want a 2m by 2m play space due to the way SteamVR chooses the forward direction of your play area. Smaller spaces and "standing" mode work, but will make the game feel a little cramped.The Thrill of the Fight is still under active development in an early state. Future improvements include tightened boxing mechanics, visual and audio polish, new opponents, and more.The Thrill of the Fight is a boxing game designed specifically for VR. Enter a virtual gym and battle unique challengers with their own boxing styles and techniques. Use timing and skill to land the knockout blow. Evade punches, land jabs, and block blows to become the king of the ring.The Thrill of the Fight is best described as a "semi-sim" with some simplified or unrealistic mechanics for the sake of fun and straightforward game play or to accommodate the limits of current VR technology. Mechanics are realistic where possible but the game is not guaranteed to be a fully accurate recreation of real boxing.
