							Rocksmith™ is the first and only game that you can plug into any real guitar or bass with a 1/4" output jack.

Nothing plastic, nothing fake, just the most authentic and complete guitar experience in music gaming. By plugging into your PC, you’ll develop real skills and real styles while playing absolutely real music.
Featuring gameplay that automatically adjusts to your personal ability, Rocksmith’s innovative game design makes playing music visually intuitive and will engage experienced musicians as well as those who have never picked up a guitar in their lives.

Unlock mini-games to hone specific skills. You’ll also be able to choose from a large catalog of songs in different styles. You’ll experience it all with an honest-to-goodness guitar or bass. Nothing compares to playing a real instrument.
