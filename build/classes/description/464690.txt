After that, add on offensive weapons such as spikes, a sword, or even a mechanical hammer that smashes your opponent in two!Physics based simulation and destructionVroomist features physics simulations, which means how you construct your vehicle is critical for it could snap in half under its own weight!Donâ€™t worry though, in combat it can be to your advantage by ramming a player in a weak spot splitting them in half!What Vroomist currently has to offerVroomist currently is focusing on the development of the physics and car construction elements of the game.
