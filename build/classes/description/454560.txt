
							About This Game
							Welcome to the Ultimate Fight Manager 2016 Early Access

We decided to enter Early Access with a fairly incomplete game. The reason for this is that we want to get feedback early in the process to be able to implement requests and ideas from the community.

With that said, please keep in mind that the game is fairly incomplete at the time of the Early Access launch. We will provide weekly updates, so you'll know exactly what we are working on and how far we have come in the process of completing our tasks.
