
							About This Game
							Experience LUXOR in stunning HD!  Answer the call of the goddess, Isis, in this addictive marble-shooter game. Chains of colored spheres are working their way through ancient Egypt, and it’s up to you to stop them before they reach the pyramids. Wielding your mystical winged-shooter, you must fire colored orbs into the chain to make matches of three or more, and eliminate the spheres from the chain. Clear out the entire chain, and you’ll work your way up to the next level. 

Customize your shooter to play LUXOR just how you like it with two different types of aim assist and three control system choices to mix-and-match.  Face off with the approaching spheres in four different game modes: Practice, Adventure, Survival, and Challenge of Horace. 

To help you in your quest, power-ups like Fireballs, Lightning Bolts and Multi-Colored Spheres will fall from the sky—use them to create thrilling special effects as they aid you along your journey!
