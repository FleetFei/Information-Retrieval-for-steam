							First of all, you should keep in mind that the game is still a work in progress and so that many things are still missing before starting to see the original idea into its entirety.If you're waiting for instant fun, maybe you should consider keeping an eye on the game and wait for a more advanced state before going any further.In the world of Hide & Hold Out, you are one of the survivors of the cataclysm which happened near the end of the 20th century.This cataclysm has led to a brutal elevation of the sea level all around the globe. Today, you don't really know if there is still a true "land" somewhere, but you know that this reef saved you after the disaster. Well... not only you, actually, and that's more of the problem.You will have to find by yourself something to eat, materials and fuel to stay alive, to build yourself a home and to start building boats and weapons.The other players can be a curse in H2o, but they can also be a blessing as working with other survivors will give you the key to both safety and power.H2o is still far from its final form, but we really wants to give a specific importance to the interactions between the players. Giving you the means to deploy large ships to fight as a team, merchant boats to trade...We plan to add a skill tree in the near future, so that each player in a group can choose a specific role. Such as scout, driver, gunner, or even a kind of doctor who could craft specific drugs to cure diseases and poisonings.We want to develop this part of the game with the community, once that the classical structure of a survival game will be properly set, balanced and stable.PRESENT:MultiplayerOpen worldPlayer ConstructionsFuel & ElectricityCrafting & Resource processingFishing, Farming, GatheringIn-game mapVoIPClan systemVehiclesAircraftsShipsModular TurretsCOMING DURING EARLY ACCESS:Advanced exploration (especially underwater)a bigger map (sized for 80 players and not ~40 as currently)More wild life, Gathering and advanced farmingGhosting & Random eventsSkills & SpecialisationDiseases & Injuries managementBounty systemBattle Mode (coming as a free update at the end of the early access)And many others...
