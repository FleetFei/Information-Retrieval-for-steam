							With a little bit of imagination you can be anything… A mighty robot, a brave knight or even an adventurous astronaut.10 Minute Tower is a unique tile-based puzzle game that will get your cogs whirring as you take control of a day-dreaming child adventurer trapped within a tower. You begin your dream as a Mighty Robot, manipulating your environment and exploring to find new costumes and gain extra abilities. Each dream brings a new maze of puzzles to explore, but there’s not much time before you wake up…Every room is a puzzle, filled with coins to collect and high scores to chase. Switch between characters on the fly to solve increasingly complex puzzles in make-believe worlds of adventure… and treasure! Use the Robot’s brute strength to push heavy blocks, swing the Knight’s sword to clear the way, and use the Astronaut’s gravity defying jumps to leap over blocked paths.Special thanks to the photographers below for their expertise and support in making this project a reality!David Bebber
