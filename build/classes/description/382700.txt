							Directed by: Will PrescottWritten by: Will PrescottStarring: Dalton Leeb, Anil Margsahayam, Christopher B. Duncan, Abby Miller, Laird Macintosh, Andrew DonnellyWhen Drew (Dalton Leeb) is asked to watch the home of Lance Bryant (Christopher B. Duncan), a successful entrepreneur, he believes it’s the key to everything that’s been missing in his life– namely a good job and some general direction. But shortly after he takes the reins of the household, a series of odd and increasingly threatening people stop by—punctuated by the home delivery of a young woman’s corpse. Not wanting to ruin an opportunity to become Bryant’s right hand man, Drew ropes his long-lost friend, Kamal, (Anil Margsahayam) into his shenanigans. As their failed attempts to fix the problem increase, so does the body count in this outrageous comedy of errors.
