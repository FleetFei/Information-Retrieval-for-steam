							NOTE: THE MAIN GAME X-PLANE 10 IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE! PLEASE ONLY PURCHASE DLCS WHEN YOU ARE OWNER OF X-PLANE 10!The Airport Southwest Florida International is located on the south-western coast of Florida and is the second busiest single-runway airport in the U.S. handling around 8 million passengers.The first plans for building this airport date back to 1973; ten years later it opened as “Southwest Florida Regional Airport”. In 1993 it got its present name. At the same time the runway was expanded from 8,400 ft to 12,000 ft. Since then, the airport has been expanded several times. For example, in 2005 a new terminal building was opened after the old one had exceeded its capacity by factor 2.This model of the Southwest Florida Intl Airport for X-Plane 10 offers a highly detailed reproduction of the real airport thanks to its 10cm/pixel aerial image and 1cm/pixel ground layout. The developer made sure to use non-repetitive textures. Baked night illumination and ambient occlusion as well as HDR lighting complete the visual impression, while static aircraft, road traffic and both animated and static apron vehicles create a lively area. Additionally, the scenery is compatible with the AutoGate plug-in, adding animated jet bridges and marshallers at all gates, as well as with the HD Mesh Scenery by Andras Fabian.Product DescriptionFeatures10 cm/pixel aerial ortho imagery covering the entire airport (approx. 8.41 sq. km)1 cm/pixel custom ground detail/markingsBaked-in, ray-traced ambient occlusion on all major buildingsBaked-in, ray-traced night illumination on the airport terminal buildingSpecular reflections and all-HDR lightingAccurate building heights, measured using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation dataDesigned using X-Plane 10-native methods for maximum performanceAnimated jet bridges and marshallers at all gates (using the freely available AutoGate plugin by Jonathan Harris)Static aircraft as an optionAnimated and static ground vehiclesVolumetric grassRoad trafficCompatible with HD Mesh Scenery v3 by Andras FabianCharts for KRSW can be found for free under: http://airnav.com/airport/KRSW
