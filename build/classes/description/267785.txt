Special Abilities (from the character card) -

When you are attacked by another character, your constant juggling causes a distraction and he must reduce his attack roll by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

Instead of attacking a character, you may impress him with your skills and take one gold from him.

Whenever you encounter a creature, you may try to confuse it. Roll one die and add your fate. If the total is higher than the creature's Strength or Craft, you may evade it. If you fail to confuse the creature, you must attack it as normal.

Whenever you visit the City, Tavern or Village, instead of encountering the space, you may perform there and earn one gold.

Whenever you visit the Castle, you may heal up to your life value for free.
