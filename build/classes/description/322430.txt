							You are in debt, your wife and kids have left and you have nothing left to lose, but how far will this take you? It is just another regular day at the office as a private detective and you find on your desk letter from a friend tipping you off to something good. You are told that a man was recently placed into quarantine in a hospital and the surrounding town closed off too. It is now your job to investigate and find out what is going on before everyone else, to give you a chance at redemption. If the story goes big, this could change your life! 

What will you find? What caused the quarantine? Times running out so you better hurry before its too late!
