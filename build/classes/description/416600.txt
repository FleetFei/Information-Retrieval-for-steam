							Defend the free world from tyrannical titans in FULL METAL FURIES - a team-based brawler where cooperation is the key to victory.

Want to play with friends? Get friends first. Four players can join in on the adventure. Play as a friendly Fighter, a near-sighted Sniper, a square Sentinel, or an oval Engineer.

Want to play alone? Expected. In single player, the dynamic Pick 2 swapping system ensures you'll have a buddy to pick you up... unless they're down as well, in which case you can use your hard earned cash to level up your skill tree and make you stronger.

Experiment with a versatile combat system full of counters, combos, cancels, and oval-shaped engineers. Unlock treasury items, equipment, and skill trees whilst exploring a massive world filled with myth, secrets, and meta-puzzles.

FULL METAL FURIES will challenge you to think like a team, and rethink what a brawler could be.

Addendum:
(An abstruse allegorical action adventure about atonement, allusions, and alliteration awaits all at an alternate age around Athens' ashes.)
