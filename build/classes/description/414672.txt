What is a dummy head recording?

About "Nameless Dummyhead Drama CD"

The scripts of the dummyhead audio drama were originally written by Crobidoll, and supervised by Cheritz. The drama shares the same characters from "Nameless ~the one thing you must recall~" but the traits of the characters and the world are drastically different.
