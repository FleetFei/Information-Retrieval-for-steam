							Positively not for wimps!The last thing you'll ever see in Atlantic Quest 2 is cute ocean critters! Instead you're in for fish in full feathers, an all fresh and grinning crab and a fat Japanese sumo fish. In this match 3 adventure under the sea you're going to help a clown fish and his friends to save their home. You'll get more than a little help from a mighty shark, a testosterone-high sea horse with sculpted abs and a quirky squid!Zombie bashing anybody?And it's this awesome underwater crew you'll lead into battle against dim-witted undead zombie fish! Six exciting missions in the depths of the blue ocean await you. We added some mighty power-ups to our frantic and challenging match 3 levels!No skill, no thrills (with gills)!Master all the mini games in Atlantic Quest 2 to crown yourself as "Saviour of the Ocean". Why? Tradingscards, achievements and some fun!
