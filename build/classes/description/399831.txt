							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Overdrive expansion.As the Inquisition engulfed Europe in the first centuries of the previous millenium, whispers spread of a dark hunter. These stories spoke of a man wielding weapons forged in Hellfire, laying waste to demons and witches and leaving only charred skulls in his wake. Even the the fiercest demons would scatter to the winds as soon as they heard the roar of his steel horse, and their numbers dwindled rapidly.After slaying the last demon in Europe in a dark forest late in the fifteenth century, the man got atop his steel horse and set off to another world in need of his services. One of the villagers saved by the man said he had a face pale as bone and introduced himself Skull Chopper Chucho, and that he would return if our world was ever threatened by hellspawn once more.This DLC contains a custom skin for Chucho Krokk in Awesomenauts, and comes with a fully customized voice set!
