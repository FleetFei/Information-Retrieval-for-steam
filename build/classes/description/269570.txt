GTGD S1 is an in-depth set of video tutorials through which you will develop an awesome little multiplayer FPS from scratch, using Unity free. I've designed these tutorials for beginners so you won't be lost. Check out my YouTube channel to see my teaching style. ATTENTION: With the release of Unity 5.1, GTGD S1 is now obsolete, so please don't buy this unless you're really keen to study a piece of history, or support my efforts.

You can watch it as I roll it out on my YouTube channel right now.This package has the added benefit of all video by video project folders to make it easier for you to debug your mistakes and accelerate your learning.
