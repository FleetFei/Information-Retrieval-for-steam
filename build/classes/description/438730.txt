							What is Poly Towns? Poly Towns is a small town builder. Start with a single town zone (the map is divided into "zones"), then expand into a larger town managing your resources along the way. Upgrade your houses and resource buildings to maintain your town. What's the gameplay like? The game is fairly simple, you start by building a few houses and resource buildings. You then must assign villagers to these resource buildings in order to get the resources. Tax, building upkeep and food consumption are updated every 10 seconds. Build up your resources and expand your town into new zones, as well as upgrading existing buildings. Once you are happy with your town, you can choose to start a new one or sit back and relax your existing town thrive. What's the challenge? In a sense, the game can be unforgiving. If your villagers are at 0% happiness, game over, you have to restart. Another way of failing the game is by having no money and a negative income, because you can no longer buy anything. If for example you have -100 coins, but a positive income, you can bounce back!
