							After weeks of being down on your luck in the big city, you've found your calling: farming! A real estate agency is selling a beautiful farm property down south, and amazingly, you have just enough in your savings to buy it outright! Risking it all, you decide to leave the city tonight in hopes of starting your farming dreams tomorrow!

Except you almost immediately get caught in a bad storm, total your car, and are now stuck in a foreign town with some of the strangest people you've ever met. Even worse, the before-thought beautiful farm is in severe disrepair and, according to the townsfolk, was never for sale in the first place! You now find yourself in a seemingly hostile town where one mystery seems to just stack on another... 

Only one thing's for sure: the town is hiding something.
