							A horror game inspired by Amnesia: The Dark Descent. One day Riario got a letter from his grandfather. He told him to seek out his journal and publish it to the world, as he has seen great things and believes that it will change the world. The poor man is puzzled when he sees the village his grandfather used to live in. Finding his diary he slowly realises that his grandfather was a part of a satanist cult. Confused as to why his grandfather believes that this diary will change the world, as it only describes dark rituals and his life as a cultist. Sacrificed spirits lie in this village, but they are now only memories, memories that haunt him.
