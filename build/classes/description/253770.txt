							Catch the bus and let it take you to a detailed, virtual world.Are you ready to explore a picturesque German city behind the wheel of a realistically modeled, freely accessible bus? Then take a look at “Bus Simulator 2012” by the well-known developer studio TML!Every technical detail of the original bus has been reproduced true-to-live. Switch on the air-conditioning when your front-shields are steaming up and keep an eye on the speedograph, to stay in schedule – even though you have a lot of missions, you will still need to rest in order to stay fit! Thanks to the digital readouts in the bus, you can monitor your engine’s temperature and the charging level of the cooling liquid as well as the oil and gasoline level.Organize your route and service more than 450 bus stops. Enjoy the realistic AI of both, pedestrians and traffic, which will also influence your own behavior while driving. Interaction with your passengers is also an important facet of your job: It is up to you to decide which ticket to sell and how to greet your customers – they will react accordingly!Thanks to TML’s fantastic ability to recreate buses and other vehicles in great detail, you will find this game to be a truly challenging bus-simulation.
