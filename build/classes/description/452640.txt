							Return to Crytek’s Dinosaur Island and enjoy another glimpse into the developer’s exciting vision for VR. Back to Dinosaur Island 2 received a glowing reception when it was first shown to attendees at E3 2015 and has previously only been playable at select industry events. Now, gamers everywhere can sample the acclaimed VR demo firsthand – scaling a deadly cliff face as huge flying dinosaurs react to their presence and debris rains down from above. Mysterious landmarks on the horizon and stunning vistas on every side combine to immerse gamers in an entirely new reality. 

Back to Dinosaur Island 2 has been built from the ground up to take advantage of the Oculus Rift HMD, and requires an Oculus Rift DK 2 (SDK version 0.8) to run. Please check the system requirements below. Virtual reality games require a high frame rate to guarantee a comfortable experience for the user. Running Back to Dinosaur Island 2 on weaker hardware can cause lower frame rates, which can lead to users having a less than ideal experience.
