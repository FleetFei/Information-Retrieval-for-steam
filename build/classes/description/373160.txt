							To celebrate the release of the Common Sense expansion for Europa Universalis IV, Paradox Books releases this classic work of the same name, in ebook format.
Thomas Paine only needed 48 pages to write Common Sense, but the impact of those pages would echo through history like few other documents before or after. The empire forged from its words still remains the worldâ€™s mightiest power more than 200 years later.
This work is in the public domain. It includes a new preface by Jakob Munthe, the Brand Manager for Europa Universalis IV.
