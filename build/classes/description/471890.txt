							The Republic F-105 Thunderchief, first flown in 1955 and often known as "Thud" by its pilots, was a rugged and reliable multi-role fighter with an emphasis on low-altitude, high-speed penetration strikes with a single nuclear bomb. At the time of its construction it was the largest fighter in the world and set several world speed records. The F-105D was the definitive variation, featuring an all-weather capability and modern avionics (for the time) with 610 units of this type being built.In Vietnam, the F-105s were used as bombers, the usual load exceeded by fifty percent the amount carried by a World War II B-17. An extra fuel tank was fitted into the spacious bomb bay while up to 12,000 lbs of bombs were suspended from five hardpoints. Though primarily used as a bomber, the Thunderchief still scored its share of downed Migs, 29 of which felt the bite of the Thud. The F-105D's wing measures 34 feet 11 inches, tip to tip. Length is 64 feet 3 inches and height is 19 feet 8 inches. Wing area is 385 square feet. With its afterburning J75-P-9V, the F-105D has a maximum speed of 1,390 mph at 50,000 feet. Empty weight is 27,500 pounds, normal weight is 38,034 pounds, gross weight is 52,546 pounds. The built-in armament of the F-105D consists of one 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon with 1,029 rounds. A great variety of missiles can be suspended from the Thunderchief's hardpoints, the actual distribution being determined by the particular mission at hand.Features:Loadouts including clean, Mk.82 bombs, M117 bombs, AGM-45 Shrike missiles, long range and post-mission (empty pylons).
