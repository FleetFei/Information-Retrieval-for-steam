							NOTE: THE MAIN GAME X-PLANE 10 IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE! PLEASE ONLY PURCHASE DLCS WHEN YOU ARE OWNER OF X-PLANE 10!Frankfurt-Hahn Airport is located in the low mountain range Hunsrück with Mainz, Koblenz and Trier being the nearest cities. Frankfurt am Main is situated about 100 km east of the airport. In the first half of 2012, about 1.28 million passengers either landed or took off from Frankfurt-Hahn. Since 2007, the number of movements has been declining to currently about 15,105.Frankfurt-Hahn was built during the US occupation and was originally to be built near Hahn. However, plans changed and the military airfield was built near Lautzenhausen. As Americans had trouble pronouncing “Lautzenhausen”, they kept on referring to it as “Hahn”.Following “Airport Hamburg” we are now releasing our second German destination for X-Plane 10: “Airport Frankfurt-Hahn”.Experience the airport featuring more than 4,000 manually placed vegetation objects and about 5,000 objects including buildings, cars and fences. “Airport Frankfurt-Hahn” is the first add-on in Germany to feature extra large aerial imagery including the surrounding villages such as Hahn, Sohren and Büchenbeuren. Despite the huge selection of objects, the add-on for X-Plane is running smoothly.Features:Detailed reconstruction of the airport including all airport institutions and the inoperative military area Photo real textures on buildings, vehicles, etc Seasonal ground textures (0.5m per pixel) Apron with realistically rendered textures Day- and night textures in high resolution 3D grass and treesCustom forests in the environmentManual (German, English)
