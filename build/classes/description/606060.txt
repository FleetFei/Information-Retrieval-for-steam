							Welcome wanderer! Are you ready for epic journey in which your mind will be tested?   Your quest is to get to the very last level of Dark Tower. On your way you'll face dangerous enemies like goblins, skeletons, mages, vampires and many more!

Every level of the tower is some kind of labrynth where first priority is to upgrade your character. It is necessary, because otherwise you won't be able to defeat enemies - you would be too weak. Another issue is to manage your door keys. You can easly get stuck! So watch out and prepare yourself for starting over again many times!

So sharpen a sword, snatch a shield and face the challange of DarkTower!
