							What kills you makes you stronger! Play as the red shirted fool as he jumps on spikes, drowns, ingests poison and finds other horrible ways to die, and then uses his corpses to reach the end! Play through over 30 levels while listening to a great retro soundtrack by VVVVVV composer, SoulEye. Are the story mode and bonus stages not enough for you? Try one of the levels that didn't make the cut on the steam workshop, or make your own for others to play! And once you've died a bunch, try flinging your corpses around on the title screen! It's quite satisfying.
