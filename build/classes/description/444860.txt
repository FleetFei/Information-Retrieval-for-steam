							Get to the doorTry not to lose yourselfSplit is a beautifully minimalist puzzle game where you divide yourself to explore, solve and create. In Split, you take control of a cube, which has the ability to break up and split into smaller cubes. Using whatever cubes you have at your disposal, you must try to solve puzzles to reach the door at the end of the level, bringing as much of yourself with you as possible.	Beautifully crafted 3D environmentsChallenging spatial puzzles 4 Unique puzzle mechanics 16 Hand-crafted levels An elegant original soundtrackSplit is based off of a 1 week prototype originally designed for a university paper, which we have had the opportunity to develop over a few monthsFor our Early Access release, we have 16 unique, fully-functioning levels for you to enjoy, each employing a combination of existing and new mechanics. Want to see your cubes do things never before thought possible? We are currently working on making these little cubes do some amazing things, alongside our pre-designed levels, we also want to facilitate the creative minds of our players. Using Unreal Engine 4 and Steam Workshop integration, we are currently working on a Level Editor for players to create their own unique puzzles and then, share them with the community.Made as part of MDS StudiosMusic designed by Michael Borcard
