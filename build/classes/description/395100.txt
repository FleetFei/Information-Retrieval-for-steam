This body has been infected by a big, nasty bugger of a germ, who is making it his business to spawn many more germs as fast as he can. You and your mob of 20 white blood cells must put a stop to his shenanigans at all costs!Use all your skills to run, jump, roll, float, bounce and teleport your way through the inhospitable tissue of your host human. But remember, each white cell can only kill one germ. So watch out for casualties!Key FeaturesControl your cells using the keyboard or XBox 360/One controllerPlay through 75 levels spread through 3 organsDefeat boss germs in each organCollect info snippets about the human immune system and biologyUnlock extra levels with their own collectible info snippetsCreate your own levels to play and share
