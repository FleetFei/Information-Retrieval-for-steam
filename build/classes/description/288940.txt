							From the haunting strains of an old piano to the pulsing beats of a contemporary EDM party, The Charnel House Trilogy OST takes you on a journey through the lives of Alex Davenport and Harold Lang as they travel towards their fateful destination. With music inspired by iconic horror score and classical opera, this tour de force from a team of talented video game musicians is a perfect companion to The Charnel House Trilogy.Jack de QuidtJack de Quidt is not only an exceptionally talented musician, but also one half of the game dev duo The Tall Trees, alongside Dan Pearce. His soundtrack to Sepulchre, which appears on and off throughout The Charnel House Trilogy, has received numerous praise, with the main theme in particular becoming a crowd favorite.  Bryan Henderson & Callum StevensonBryan is a Computer Arts & Design student, and his role in scoring Inhale and Exhale will be his first foray into the world of composing for video games. That's not to say he's a stranger to the gaming industry, however - if Bryan's name is familiar, it's because he's also known as the God of Gods; the winner of Peter Molyneux's Curiosity app, and the future ruler of Godus. Callum Stevenson is Bryan's mysterious recording partner, of whom absolutely nothing is known except for his fantastic musical skills. He probably wears a mask.Gavin HarrisonGavin Harrison is a composer for games, film and TV, and has provided music for almost every good indie game you've ever played in the last three years. Maybe. He's done a LOT, anyway. And it is great. Now he's doing something for The Charnel House Trilogy, which is also great. nervous_testpilotPaul Kilduff-Taylor, aka nervous_testpilot, aka one half of Mode 7, is a known industry troublemaker with a history of releasing both music and video games. As nervous_testpilot, Paul's EP 'Steel & Glass' features in The Charnel House Trilogy, because Alex is canonically a fangirl of both British EDM and Paul himself. Pavel UlyanovAs the brother of Charnel House Trilogy co-creator Ivan, Pavel is a mysterious musician who descends upon the offices of Owl Cave when needed, ready to lay down a beat or provide some audio direction. If Batman could play guitar, he'd be Pavel.Track ListGloriaâ€™s Final Ride - 03:41Performed by Gavin HarrisonThe Days Are Endless - 03:51Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonSnow Covers Ice - 03:26Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonDarling Dreams - 02:24Performed by Jack de QuidtUnearthing the Truth - 00:33Performed by Jack de QuidtThe Key Copied Midnight - 03:02Performed by Jack de QuidtMan in a Burial Shroud - 02:14Performed by Jack de QuidtDown Among The Worms - 01:39Performed by Jack de QuidtLydia Lost - 02:49Performed by Jack de QuidtRaven, Blackbird, Seagull, Swan - 03:10Performed by Jack de QuidtNoisemaker - 04:18Performed by nervous_testpilotSteel and Glass - 04:15Performed by nervous_testpilotDetails - 03:52Performed by nervous_testpilotForever - 05:20Performed by nervous_testpilotA Single Grain of Dirt - 02:36Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonRooms Without Views - 03:30Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonRebirth of the Author - 02:19Performed by Pavel UlyanovThe Earth Crawls - 02:38Performed by Gavin HarrisonA Single Grain (Unearthed Mix) - 02:04Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonRooms Without Views (Open Door Mix) - 03:30Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonRooms Without Views (Shutters Down Mix) - 03:30Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum StevensonTo view the soundtrack, right click on The Charnel House Trilogy in your game list, go to "properties", go to the "local files" tab, and click "browse local files".
