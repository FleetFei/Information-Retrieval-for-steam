							This DLC gives you the right to create a Pirate with a backstory and a Ship (completely designed by you!) entered into the game. This will immortalise you in the eyes of your peers! We'll add it to the game in the Crusade and Sandbox Modes (and potentially Voyage too!) and ALL Players will be able to view your EPICNESS, then hunt, ram and generally destroy your Pirate Ship until their ears bleed and their feet are warm with the blood of their victories… You'll enter your name and backstory through our Kracking Rewards Achievement Kindred Entertainment Network (KRAKEN)(aka website) where we'll either approve it or give feedback if it doesn't quite fit. We’ll also contact you so that you can tell us which of your workshop ships you want us to assign to your new Pirate. Note: This DLC doesn’t change the game in any way – it only gives you the right to enter your content into the game which will will roll out in a future update.Your character must follow the KRAKEN guidelines: nothing too naughty - we have kids playing you know!Keep it in theme: this is a Viking, Monster ship game where you destroy most of the things you encounterName must be no longer than 25 CharactersBio must be no longer than 150 CharactersShip MUST float and be built with 450 blocks or lessNOTE: Refunds are NOT available on DLC.
