							It is March 15, 1920 and the town of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur has been overrun by mad men killing and burning everything in sight. You are the last survivor of the Japanese expeditionary force in Siberia. You must fight to survive and in the end find a way to save Harmony. Fight off soldiers driven mad by over consumption of varnish in the aftermath of the Nikolayevsk incident (尼港事件). Search the area for radio parts to build a radio to call for help. 
 
Try not die of exposure in the frozen Siberian countryside. Cut down trees and start fires  to stay warm. Hunt deer and other game and cook the meat to regain health. Explore the endless Siberian forest during the day and night. Use lights to illuminate the way in the dark.  Avoid dangerous meteorite fallout spread throughout the area or cover them with snow using a shovel.
