							Stop the mean Pouchy, save the little Critters and restore the harmony in the world! Happy Critters is an adorable puzzle game with loads of levels, ranging from easy to really challenging ones for you to enjoy!
The little Critters have enjoyed their safe and carefree lives in their beautiful forest, until one day everything began to fall apart, all the Critters were simply gone and their homes faded away!  The worst manikin of them all appeared out of nowhere and started to capture little Critters. We need to save them! You're our only hope!

It is easy to learn, but quite difficult to master, because of its 120+ levels which range from easy to very difficult, as well as the gameplay itself that lasts longer, and requires more engagement and focus from the player in contrast to the average title in the genre.
