Now, hot on the trail of Ramaz, she is ready to turn up the heat and let loose her full power. Chandra has a group of fiery creatures at her disposal, but if things get too rough, she can unleash wave after wave of powerful spells to blast her way out of any jam. With all this fire burning within, you are certain to blaze a trail to victory! Additional content for Magic 2014.
