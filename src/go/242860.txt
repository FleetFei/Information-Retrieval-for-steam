The merciless trench warfare offers a unique battlefield experience, immersing you and your squad into intense battles of attack and defense.<br><br>The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.<br><br>Verdun key features include: <br>\u2022<strong>Realistic World War 1 gameplay:<\/strong> Authentic weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, gore, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore and artillery barrages<br>\u2022<strong>Tactical squad-based FPS:<\/strong>  Unique squad leveling system, distinct squad types and roles, voice chat<br>\u2022<strong>True trench warfare:<\/strong>   Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum-based attack and counter-attack gameplay<br>\u2022<strong>Authentic World War 1 setting:<\/strong>  Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields set on the Western Front<br>\u2022<strong>Challenging game modes:<\/strong>  Team-based Frontline, tactical Attrition, skill-based Rifle Deathmatch and desperate survival in Squad Defense<br><br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/242860\/extras\/Steam_text_divider.png?t=1490782656\"><br><br>The Frontlines game mode is unique in its tactical complexity. The realistic trenches are challenging to fight in and require tactical cunning to capture and defend. The Entente and Central Powers strive to gain control of frontline sectors. In one battle you\u2019ll find yourself rushing the enemy trenches during an offensive action in order to gain ground, while in another you might be defending your recently conquered ground against a fierce enemy counter-attack.<br>Players can choose to be part of one of the many squad types in the game, each of which have their own distinct tactical roles. By working together with your friends, you can earn experience that improves the power and versatility of your squad. As you gain more experience fighting and get promoted in rank, you also earn Career Points which you can use to unlock specializations, weapons and equipment.<br><br>In the Attrition game mode, the Entente and the Central Powers are pitted against each other in a single battle. Each side has a number of tickets which represents the amount of manpower they have. When a player is killed and respawns, a ticket is deducted from the side they belonged to. When a side has no more tickets, players of that side cannot respawn - the last side standing wins!<br> <br>The Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all game mode, where all players are pitted against each other in a thrilling contest of skill using only bolt-action rifles.<br> <br>In the Squad Defense mode, the player along with three squad-mates will have to defend a position as long as they can against endless waves of AI controlled attackers.<br><br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/242860\/extras\/Verdun_SteamStoreTitle_1_EN.png?t=1490782656\"><br>The gameplay is as immersive and gritty as it can get with elements such as realistic gore that portrays the true horror of the 1st World War Battlefield. This feature can naturally be disable if preferred. The authentic weapons need to be handled with skill, as they each feel differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim.  Also, the realistic bullet physics require you to lead your shots when firing on a moving target at long range. In the event of a gas attack, you need to put on your gas mask, which impairs your view and gives you a very claustrophobic experience. And if getting shot or gassed isn\u2019t enough, sudden artillery barrages that are called in by NCO\u2019s can pin you down if you\u2019re caught in the open and might obliterate your entire squad. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! <br><br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/242860\/extras\/Verdun_SteamStoreTitle_2_EN.png?t=1490782656\"><br>Team play is what lies at the heart of Verdun. When you start a game, your first choice is to fight for either the Entente or the Central Powers. You can form one of the different squad types available to that side with up to three of your friends.  Each squad has a specific tactic that is based on the historical units of that time. Depending on your squad\u2019s type, players can choose a specific role within the squad, complete with historically accurate attire, weapons and special abilities. The more Co-op experience you and your squad mates earn together, the more powerful your squad will become and the better abilities will  be unlocked. This progression is also shown visually as you and your squad get more advanced uniforms. You will also earn Career Points, which can be spent to unlock specializations, weapons and equipment. <br><br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/242860\/extras\/Verdun_SteamStoreTitle_3_EN.png?t=1490782656\"><br>The true WW1 battlefield experience has been captured in a real-time dynamic frontline, set in historically accurate locations of the Western Front. These frontline maps are comprised out of multiple sectors that can be captured by either side.

Also, everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere that is so typical of WW1; Gloomy clouded skies, an immersive interface combined with realistic sounds, accurate native voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the trenches, mud covered - trenches whilst peering over your rifle to spot the enemy.<br><br>Follow us on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VerdunGame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VerdunGame\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Facebook<\/a> <br>Contact us via Discord: <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/dUY5DSu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/dUY5DSu<\/a>","about_the_game":"Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting.
