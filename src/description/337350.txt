							Flip your shipâ€™s polarity between three different colors to get around obstacles. Each maneuver that you perform, such as flapping like a bird, or tumbling like a baton, changes its color. Match the ship's color with a shape's to pass through it, hit an obstacle as the wrong color and fail. The pace is unrelenting and, in a blink, the challenge resets without penalty.
