							Disturbed is an adventure/horror visual adventure, inspired by experiences of depression and addiction. All visuals are hand-drawn to express personality and a sense of horror.Play as a farmer who struggles to manage a failing farm. You come to a point where there is no more hope, and you must do something. You figure that you will die and it is just a matter of how and where. What difference is there to make? What can a simple farmer do? Only you can answer these questions.Disturbed is powered by the Ren'py Engine, using default settings which help aid the game's atmosphere. Visuals are 800x600 resolution by default, something that may not happen again for future games.Disturbed includes various puzzles in which the player needs to obtain items and use them at specific places. There is no inventory system however, which makes this experience unique. Because of this, areas and objects react differently depending on whether the player has a specific item or not. This also happens for some of the conversations in the game.
