							Trickshot is a VR archery platformer that is a throwback to classic platformers of the 90's and early 00's.Trickshot aims to fill a niche in the VR playspace by allowing the player to explore larger environments and experience platforming from a new perspective. Trickshot uses 'artificial locomotion' in that you do not teleport around the level and instead navigate in a more traditional way by running and jumping in first person.Explore 10 diverse environments (and a thorough tutorial mind you) and set the top scores on the steam leaderboards. Alternately, you can play locally against your friend's times and even play against their ghosts for added fun.
