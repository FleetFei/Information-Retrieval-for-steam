							May 2025. The Earth is attacked by extraterrestrial species. Their motives became clear just as they arrived - they wanted our chicken. All of it.

It took humanity a great effort to save the last bucket of grilled chicken and now it's only up to you to protect it from alien invaders.

Be the saviour of mankind and embrace some unprecedented carnage.
Kick those alien bottoms away from our home planet with your bare hands and some other devices and bring the chicken feast upon us!

Get into the battle and clear Earth from the aliens! Use various weapons, shoot them out, burn them out, cut them out! Your friend, Helicopter, will assist you in the fight.
