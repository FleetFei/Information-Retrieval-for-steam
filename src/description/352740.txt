							Unwilling to be replaced in her position as a minor kingdom’s princess by a popular and semi-perfect rival, Lillian has to fight other ladies in raising sim themed card battles. 
“Work”, “School” and “Item” cards all raise stats and the goal is to raise all the stats to maximum before the opponent does. 
Will she manage to defend her position as the kingdom's princess and prove to the world she's the best girl for the job? 

Princess battles is a visual novel with raising sim themed card battles, a female protagonist and four romanceable male characters. 
You build up stats by doing card battles with other girls. The game is full of rivals, each with her own unique style and each gives you a unique new outfit when you win. 

Your choices (as well as your card battling skills) influence the outcome and lead to one out of several possible endings. 

New cards are unlocked gradually. After the main story is completed, freeplay mode unlocks and you can customize your deck and battle any opponent you unlocked so far.
