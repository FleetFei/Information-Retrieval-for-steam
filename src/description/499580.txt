							CAUTION! Crystal Control II is local multiplayer only and requires at least one gamepad to play. We may include a single player mode in the future, but online play is not likely to happen anytime soon (if ever).Crystal Control II is a competitive bullet hell game for two players. Choose from 8 characters, each with their own unique abilities, as you fight for control of the battlefield. Capturing crystals gives you more firepower, which means more bullets for your opponent to dodge. Capture majority crystals and unleash your special attack!Local multiplayer action for two! Fight for control of the crystals to gain more firepower and take out your opponent...you only need to get one hit on them to win!Easy to learn, hard to master! We've seen players of all skill levels pick up the game and understand it's simple controls. Don't let the simplicity fool you, though! The skill ceiling can be quite high, allowing room for the competitive folks to shine.Eight playable characters! Each character has different movement speeds, charge times, and "Control" abilities (which can be executed after capturing more than half of the total crystals on-screen). Some even have unique charge shots!Some notes about controller supportCrystal Control II is best played with two gamepads, but we also support gamepad vs keyboard matches if you only have one gamepad. We also plan to include a mode which allows two players to share a single gamepad.We do not currently have any plans to support a keyboard only mode for Versus. Most keyboards have a limit on simultaneous key presses that is much too low for the number of keys Crystal Control II would require (which means that key presses would be dropped randomly and create unfair matches). However, any future single player content WILL support keyboard.
