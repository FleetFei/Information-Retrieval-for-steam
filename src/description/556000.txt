							Your gold is lost! All you have ever fought for! It's time for a last crusade and get back what's yours! You are one of the last remaining crusaders and all your gold you conquered was stolen out of your giant vault. Jump into procedurally generated dungeons and fight the creatures who stole your gold. Kill them to gain experience and grab your gold. Craft over 20 swords with different attributes to fight the growing threat. The higher your experience is, the more gold the creatures will drop. Get to the end of the dungeon to bring your gold to your vault. If you die, your experience is lost as well as the currently collected gold. Be strong! It's your gold they stole!
