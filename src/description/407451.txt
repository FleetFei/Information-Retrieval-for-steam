							The Windsor Pack includes ‘The Windsor’ Ironcast which uses a unique device to steal a layer of shield defences from its opponent, weakening them whilst improving its own defences. It also includes Commander Henry Brent who has a signature augmentation which rewards players who match long chains of nodes with a temporary shield boost. In addition, his Ironcast always begins the game with an active shield layer.
