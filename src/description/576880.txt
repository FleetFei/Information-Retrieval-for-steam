							It has been only a few weeks since they came. The aliens have taken a majority of the population centers out and are working on remote areas now. As far as you know everyone is already dead. All communications were blocked as soon as they arrived so there is no way to know if anyone else has survived this long. You were brought up in this part of the bayou and fortunately a previous battle against the aliens was already fought here leaving behind a plethora of weaponry. 

Eventually they will get you. They seem almost endless in supply. Their spacecraft seem to be the source of their hive spawning. Taking them out might slow them down at least...
