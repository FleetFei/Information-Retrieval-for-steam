							Cakewalk Mutant Revenge is a suite of 300 all new sounds for Z3TA+ 2 that equips modern music producers with a heavy round of sonic artillery for dance floor warfare. This library is loaded with blistering hot leads, epic build ups, disembodied pads, cosmic synthesis FX, and a platinum collection of huge low-end mutant bass patches.
