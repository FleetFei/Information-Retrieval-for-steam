							1Heart can be characterized as a point-and-click puzzler, but one that is bound to defy genre conventions. Its most distinctive feature lies in the undeniably unorthodox and deeply atmospheric art design.If you put a high value on game aesthetics and run-of-the-mill visuals turn you off from playing, the eye-catching, well-realised visuals of 1Heart will capture your imagination.   The tale of 1Heart follows a boy in search of his lost twin sister -- a chilling and tense journey that will see you traverse over 60 solitary,strange and often outright harrowing landscapes that brim with unique puzzles and more than a hundred usable items to aid your quest.Watch the trailer to find out more.
