							The Boeing-Vertol CH-47 Chinook™ is a versatile, twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter. Boasting top speeds of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h), the Chinook ™ was faster than contemporary utility and attack helicopters when it was introduced in the 1960s. It is one of the few aircraft of that era such as the C-130 and the UH-1 'Huey' that is still in front line service with over 1,179 built so far. Its primary roles include troop movement, artillery emplacement and battlefield resupply.Virtavia’s FSX: Steam Edition of the Chinook is a faithful reproduction of the aircraft featuring various animations, authentic flight dynamics, and high res gauges.
