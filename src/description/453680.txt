							Grab some friends and step up to the tee as you putt your way through nine unique and challenging holes in MiniGolf Mania! We’ve designed the controls to be very user-friendly while giving you precise control over the speed and direction of your shots. Providing hours of fun and entertainment for all ages, MiniGolf Mania is a great game at a great price! Multiplayer: MiniGolf Mania can be played solo or with up to four players locally. The game supports a single controller feature, so you don’t need four controllers to play with four players. The Course: MiniGolf Mania has one arcade-themed course, featuring nice holes based on some of the classic arcade games including Air Hockey, Skee Ball, Whack-a-Mole, and Pinball. These nine holes were meticulously designed and hand-crafted, each with a unique layout and challenging obstacles. The Power-Ups: MiniGolf Mania also features six unique power-ups designed to spice up multiplayer gameplay: •	Fire – Leaves behind a trail of fire, launching any ball that touches it into the air. •	Ice – Leaves behind a trail of ice that causes any ball that rolls over it to slip and slide uncontrollably. •	Blast – Explodes immediately when used, flinging away any nearby objects. •	Weight – Makes your ball super heavy, making it immune to fire, ice, and blast effects. •	Jump – Catapults your ball into the air when used. •	Brake – Slows your ball down very quickly when used.
