							Fight for your life in Call of Tomsk-7, a simple side-scrolling shooter. Horrifying monsters are pouring out of the forgotten and abandoned Soviet-era Tomsk-7 biological weapons facility. You must fight the creatures in a seemingly endless battle of attrition. Improve your score to unlock new weapons and perks in the form of hats that give you special upgrades and attributes to help survive the onslaught. You must strategically call in air drops of secondary weapons consisting of Molotov cocktails, land mines, Tomahawks, and anti-bug smoke bombs in order to ensure your long term survival.
