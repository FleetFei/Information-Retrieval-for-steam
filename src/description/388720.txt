Link: The Unleashed Nexus is a HIGH - DIFFICULTY fast-paced action game which will challenge the player to stay in the air. “HAVEN” is a world governed by a “Nexus,” a stone that restricts people’s thoughts. Awakening at its lowest stratum, the player must bound over enemies, and glide and dash non-stop to find a way out of the world.
