							The Cold War Era isn't over, it's just beginning
 
Military might, stealthy spies, blatant propaganda, and high-tech Space Race marvels are all at war game lovers' fingertips when they choose to play as the U.S.A. or the U.S.S.R. and rewrite history in The Cold War Era.
 
TCWE is a single player RTS strategy game based on the epic conflict between the Americans and the Soviets spanning the 1950s through the 1990s. Within one hour of gameplay players will course through four decades of contention, paranoia, secrecy, and the overarching the "us vs. them" mentality.
