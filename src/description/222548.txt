							The demise of steam traction in North America during the 1940s saw the birth of the hard-working GE 44 Tonner switcher, now available for Train Simulator in the livery of Boston & Maine, one of the most dominant railroads of the northern New England region.On the eve of World War II, steam in North America began to be replaced by diesel traction, and a number of switchers were introduced by GE Transportation Systems for industrial and light duties. More than 380 locomotives were produced between 1940 and 1956, with different variants produced for the US Armed Forces, Indian Government and the Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses.The GE 44 Tonner for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Boston & Maine livery and features opening cab doors and windows, and interior and gauge lighting.
