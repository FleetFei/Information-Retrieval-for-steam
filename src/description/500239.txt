							The Beechcraft T-34 Mentor is based on the earlier piston-engine variants produced in the late-1940s. Almost six decades after it was designed, this propeller-driven, single-engine military trainer remains in service, having provided a crucial stepping stone for thousands of student pilots. The T-34C Turbo Mentor variant was produced in 1973 and is powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-25 turboprop engine. The Turbo Mentor remained in production right up to 1990.
