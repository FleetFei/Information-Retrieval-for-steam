							Galaxy Combat Wargames is a multiplayer PvP space shooter that engages you in challenging and intensely competitive space combat matches against other fighters from around the world. Face-to-face battles put your maneuvering skills to test; where you employ your reflexes on evasive actions to avoid bullets and deadly missiles; and you carefully choreograph attacks intended to destroy the opponent before they destroy you. Your spacecraft is equipped with deadly weapons to destroy the opponent and their base. Fighters with better combat skills and maneuvering strategy earn wins and rewards to reach higher ranks in the force. Galaxy Combat Wargames offers a thrilling space combat experience with intuitive fun controls and third person camera that shows a true and immersive head to head view in 3D. Zoknocs, the enemy residing in a distant galaxy in the deep space has planned to launch a fierce attack on Planet Dionos a second time to annihilate all that is left.
