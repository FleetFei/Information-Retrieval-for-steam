
							About This Software
							Craftmas is a virtual winter wonderland where anyone can create their own colorful 3D ornaments, decorate a tree, and take pictures to share their festive world.

Whether you wish to build a simple snowman or a masterfully-engineered sleigh, Craftmas gives you the easy-to-use tools to get creative in 3D. Built for first-time VR users as well as experienced early-adopters, the Creation Station features both Easy and Advanced modes. 

We created Craftmas to share our love for VR with friends and family - and now, the broader community - in a way that brings everyone together. 
For those that aren't able to build a delightful tree with you in person, you're able to take and share snapshots of your virtual creations in-game.
