							Players take control of Robots loaded to the gears with weapons and bad attitudes. In their struggle for dominance, these robots fight one another or hordes of cockroaches, CandyCubz, and BoomCubez for control of the map. These little Botz, however, are fighting in ridiculous environments. From kitchen tables to dirty bathrooms the MiniBotz will stop at nothing to reign supreme.
