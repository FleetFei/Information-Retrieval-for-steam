							This stunning train has been upgraded to give you the best experience. The Nickel Plate has had its Train Motion settings tweaked to mimic realistic behaviour using the new Train Motion system in TANE.

In addition to this, you can now play the brand new driving session created for this train. This means you can find the Nickel Plate train located in the Kickstarter County session menu. That isn’t to say you can’t go and place it in Surveyor yourself like before, but we thought some of you will want to just get in and drive!
