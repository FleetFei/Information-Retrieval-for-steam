							Battle Battalions is a free-to-play, tactical PC game that allows you to command a role-specific ‘Battalion’ of military might on a fast-paced, team-based battlefield. 

•	Battalions are the Backbone - customize and command your personalized Battalions armed to the teeth with lethal military units ranging from stealthy Snipers to hard-hitting Juggernaut tanks. 	

•	Real-Time Tactical Combat - engage in fast-paced, real-time action by deploying ability-boosting air drones, swiveling your tanks’ turrets to blast an enemy's weak side or extracting pinned-down friendlies in trouble.

•	Control The Battlefield - roll your Pathfinder Recon Battalion into thick brush for added armor protection or deploy your Suppressor Mortar Battalion on elevated terrain for high-ground ranged assaults.  Taking and defending key points on the battlefield awards decisive advantages and a quicker path to victory.

•	Teamwork Above All - each player's Battalion fills a critical role in your 5-player teams.  Coordination with your fellow Battalions is crucial as you play to your own strengths, offset your teammates' limitations, and contribute to your team's overall battle plan.  

•	Enhance and Advance - gain valuable experience and credit with each battle, allowing you to purchase powerful enhancements, personal customizations and perks unique to your Battalion.  Upgrade your player account to unlock a near endless variety of options to deepen and enhance your battlefield effectiveness.  

•	Ease of Play - eager to jump right in and join the fight?  Just click the big 'Battle' button at the top of the screen any time to get your Battalion's boots on the ground in seconds.   The controls are intuitive to keep the action flowing, and many visual elements in the interface offer helpful mouse-over tooltips.
