							The "Wizard's Survival Kit" allows you to equip the following items for your character:
						
						Wizard's Hat (item) - No wizard of note would ever be seen outdoors without one of these pointy hats.
						Sharp Sword (item) - The instruction reads “stick them with the pointy end”. Good to have in a pinch.
						Staff +1(item) - Whack your foes over the head, use it to prod mucky waters or lean on it to look cool - the staff +1 let’s you do all of it in style.
						Meteor Shower (new Magick) - Rain burning rocks down on your enemies. ‘Nuff said.
