
							About This Game
							Lost and alone in a place that feels strangely familiar. Can you solve the puzzles and find clues to uncover the secrets of Verdant Creek?

Retaliation is a Student project produced by the 'Electric Bandwidth' team back in 2014 while studying at the 'University of Creative Arts Farnham'.

Active Development is still taking place. It is my intent to respond to feedback and anything that can be done to improve the game will be considered and hopefully implemented.
