							Some artists are odd ducks. But wait until you meet these odd duck-artists! THE MILLION DOLLAR DUCK follows the humorous and heartfelt journey of six wildlife artists competing to win the Federal Duck Stamp Contestâ€”the only juried art competition run by the U.S. government and one of the most successful conservation tools ever created. Feathers will be ruffled and some egos will be bruised, but for one contestant, winning "the Olympics of wildlife art" will be life-changing.
