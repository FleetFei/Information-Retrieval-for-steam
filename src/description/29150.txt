					Step away from the computer!                    
					Welcome to Mightier, the action puzzler that pulls you away from the screen to solve puzzles by hand with pencil and paper.                     
					Using a color printer and web camera, the game prints puzzle pages for you to draw on, then captures the results when you're done.                     
					From your drawings, Mightier constructs a landscape and characters for a fun and engaging 3d platformer.                     
					Drawing by hand is a lot more fun, but the game also supports mouse drawing for those without a printer, webcam, or spare paper.
