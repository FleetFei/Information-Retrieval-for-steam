							The three-car BR 420 electric multiple unit (EMU) has plied its trade across many of Germany’s city S-Bahn networks, and is now available for Train Simulator with scenarios for the Munich-Augsburg route.In total, 480 units were built for the S-Bahn networks of Munich, Frankfurt and Stuttgart between 1969 and 1997, before being largely replaced by the Class 423. Initially, the three-car units were constructed from steel, before being built using aluminium, making the cars more lightweight and capable of carrying a heavier payload.A top speed of 120 km/h (75mph) and quick acceleration made these units ideal for the commuter stopping services in Germany’s larger cities, however the class’ retirement saw many units scrapped, although some have survived and still operate on the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network.The BR 420 for Train Simulator, developed by Michael Fruchtl, is available in Deutsche Bahn’s distinctive red and white livery and features combined throttle and brake control, SIFA driver vigilance device, PZB warning system, operating sun visors, cab and desk lighting, automatic couplings, and configurable destination displays.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR 420 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Munich-Augsburg route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).The three-car BR 420 electric multiple unit (EMU) has plied its trade across many of Germany’s city S-Bahn networks.In total, 480 units were built for the S-Bahn networks of Munich, Frankfurt and Stuttgart between 1969 and 1997, before being largely replaced by the Class 423.
