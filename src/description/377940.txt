							Control gravity and negotiate your way through a series of increasingly difficult puzzles!Now with optional VR support for the HTC Vive!In Slam, you control only one thing - gravity. All you have to do is get the glowing energy crate to the goal - simple enough, until we throw in barrels, sliders, switches, magnets, teleporters and a whole host of other mechanics that turn difficult puzzles into near-impossible ones.Take on the challenge of solving over 50 levels - and once you've solved them, try the tougher challenge of solving them in the smallest number of moves.If you have a HTC Vive, Slam is also playable in VR - walk around the puzzles to try and understand them better, or for a fun new perspective, use the - and = keys to make yourself bigger or smaller.
