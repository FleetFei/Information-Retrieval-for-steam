							"Seeing that music plays such a core role in this game, how good is it? In a word — amazing."-Nintendo Enthusiast, 9/10"If I had to pick one word to describe Tadpole Treble, that word would be 'charming'." -Destructoid, 8/10"Guys, I freaking love this game. Seamlessly synchronized and filled to the brim with charm and personality, Tadpole Treble is unquestionably a must-have."-The Inner Circle Games Network, 9.4/10"Tadpole Treble is one of the sweetest games I’ve ever played, despite it being wall-to-wall terror for the poor tadpole." -TinyCartridge"It’s the epitome of what an aesthetic and music-focused game should be: simple gameplay made fun by good game design and an outstanding soundtrack." -Steam reviewer Mo05emanFrom the creators of the hit webcomic Brawl in the Family comes the delightfully musical adventure game Tadpole Treble!As Baton, you’ll literally be “playing along” with the game’s music as you dodge past predators and obstacles who take the place of the notes for that level’s song. Avoid enemies and hit percussive notes on the beat to accumulate points and fill your Treble Charge to blast through anything in your path. Tadpole Treble features 30 original music compositions, 13 levels, and 5 boss battles. In addition to the story mode, the game includes bonus content such as unlockable music, a large bestiary, game commentaries, and online leaderboards for every level. Best of all is the robust Composition Mode which lets players create their own original levels and music!
