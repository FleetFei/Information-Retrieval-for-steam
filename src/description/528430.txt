							Wells is an action side-scrolling game with 3D graphics, its style is a direct reference to a classic subgenre of games that was popular in the 90's, the Run and Gun. Prepare yourself for facing hordes of enemies, explosions, gigantic bosses and a dangerous and fascinating journey into a steampunk universe. Play as Wells, a steampunk hero ready to find an amazing variety of weapons, each unique in design and functionality, and get ready to face a plethora of enemies and challenges. Even though the ammo is unlimited, keep in mind that your gun can overheat and you'll have to wait for the cooldown to get back to action!
