In order to confront the destructive force, Tony creates an armored suit infused with high-tech weaponry. To stop the evil that he himself has raised form the earth, Tony must become his greatest invention ever - Iron Man! The newly born champion must travel to the four corners of the earth to battle the Mandarin's henchmen, the Elementals - four magical warriors who harness the power of the elements - earth, water, wind, and fire - with deadly chemistry. But is the Iron Knight, as he his known in the prophecy, strong enough to defy fate and turn back the malevolent forces hell-bent on earth's destruction?
