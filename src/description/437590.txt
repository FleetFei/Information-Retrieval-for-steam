							Only the host needs to own this DLC. 1-5 Players | Ages 13 & Up Approximately 30 minutesTiny Epic Galaxies, designed by Scott Almes, is driven by an exciting dice-rolling mechanic that rewards thoughtful programming of the results. Players control a home planet and a series of space ships within their own personal galaxy. As players upgrade their galaxies they gain access to more ships and more dice.Each turn, a player will roll a set of dice, how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player’s galaxy. Each side of the die (6 sided) represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, Improve a Diplomatic Influence.After the roll, the player then sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order. Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate! This gets very exciting, as it allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. But don’t fret! Other players have the option to copy other player’s actions… at a cost!In addition to upgrading galaxies, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player’s favor.As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!You are the ruler of your galaxy and there are no limits to your expansion!
