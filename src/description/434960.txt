
							About This Game
							Test the dexterity of your fingers and the strength of your resolve with this original yet familiar game.
The objective is simple: guide the orb through each level's course to the end. But do not be fooled. Within lies many perils to be braved: high-speed electric repulsion fields, teleporters, pressure-sensitive drop platforms, and various other obstacles.
But the greatest opposition on your path to victory... is YOU.
Will you second guess your jump?
Will you underestimate your momentum?
Will you let down your guard?
From laughable to seemingly impossible, will you keep victory in sight? Or let it roll away?

Welcome to the Rolling Gauntlet Trials.
See if you are ready to traverse the universe in four demo levels.
