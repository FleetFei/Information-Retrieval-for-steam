							Left alone is a psychological horror game set in multiple believable interior and exterior environments. The game has a unique, high octane atmosphere which means you'll feel like you're truly beginning an adventure you'll never quite forget.

You play in First-Person as Joel Dent, ex-military officer, recent divorcee and still recovering from physical trauma. Joel and his best friends arrange a meeting point in the forests of Wisconsin, for a fun and adventurous weekend away camping but strange goings-on lead Joel to an abandoned school with a horrific past. The search for his friends uncovers horrors beyond his worst nightmares and Joel may wish he was "Left Alone".

Left Alone was developed by just two people and took two long, hard years to develop. We hope that you will enjoy the experience as much as we did making the game.
