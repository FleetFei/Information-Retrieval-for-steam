							SinaRun is a minimalist 3D platform/racing game.The goal? Simply make the best time! What makes you different from the other players is not the cheap abilities you can get on the playground. It's how good you will be at optimizing jumps, turns and general route-finding.The game is designed to not lead the players toward any levels. While all levels are (currently) pretty similar all levels feature slight changes in gameplay. Do you like small and quick jumps? Maybe you prefer bigger levels with turns and falls? What about sliding?Find a level you like, play it hundreds of times and eventually maybe be the best on the leaderboard!Current Features : 16+ Levels with multiple paths. Finding a good route is the first step toward a good time!Leaderboards (Beat your friends or compete in the global leaderboard)Online Multiplayer (Server browser, join your friends etc.)Music by the awesome General Fuzz (Early Access Trailer Music by Keffy Kay)
