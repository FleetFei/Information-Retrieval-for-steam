							Tackle incredible game hazards, such as spinblades, gun bunkers, huge boulders, Firejets, pits, Firechutes, Lavawalls, gas grates, and more. "Like DOOM, Rise of the Triad is a high quality, fast scrolling first-person perspective 3D action game. Graphics are on par with DOOM. It has destructive enemies and lots of them, an arsenal of weapons from simple pistols to missile launchers, life-preserving armor, traps and ambushes galore, and the ability to play by modem or network. In all, there's a great degree of similarity between the two games. In addition, Rise of the Triad puts most of the other DOOM wannabes to shame - it's that good!" -  Chuck Miller, Editor of interactive EntertainmentFeaturesRise of the Real Estate: Super huge levels - up to one million sq. feet, and up to 16 stories high!Digital Diversity: Ten unique, digitized enemies in the game, plus four multi-stage bosses!Win Your Way: Thirteen hardcore weapons and play as one of five characters, each with unique attributes and abilities.Collateral Damage: Nearly every object can be destroyed - even mark walls with bullet holes!Connect and Kill: Modem and network playable, up to 11 players via an IPX compatible network.Controller Support: Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.
