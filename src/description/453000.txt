							TheWave allows users of any musical skill to create and perform music in VR using 3D interfaces. Users can manipulate music in new ways using motion control and perform full DJ sets without using any type of physical hardware. One core innovation is the ability to control the music and visuals - DJ and VJ - at once. Never before have musicians been able to control the music and the world around them at a live show.
