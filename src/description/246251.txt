							Greed can be fatal! Try this new concept with more than three times the usual number of sleeping ghosts appearing again and again. 
Power up frequently and gobble up those ghosts like crazy. Eat as many ghosts as you can, but never become too greedy and forget to secure an escape route while you're still powered up! You'll quickly realize that it's next to impossible to eat all the sleeping ghosts on a map with just one power-up! 
Try this new challenge for advanced players and get the highest score in the world!
Add-on included in the All You Can Eat Add-on Pack and Edition.
