							This critically acclaimed first-person RPG takes the player on an amazing journey into the fantasy world of Arx. The game mixes intelligent story with immersive and actual medieval surroundings. Arx Fatalis allows the player to feel that all his actions have a direct consequence on those around him.
					The goal of the game is to destroy the secret cult of Akbaa, the god of destruction. As a player, you must prevent the return of such a cruel creature to the physical world. Should you fail, Akbaa is bound to impose its terror upon the world of Arx.
					You will become the hero of an underground world - with weapons, spells and magical items to defend against goblins, trolls, rat-men and other vicious opponents.
					Besides brute force, stealth and the "onscreen gesture based magic system" are the three alternative ways to succeed.   Using the mouse, flaming runes can be drawn in mid-air.  A combination of these gestures can create powerful magic spells that will protect you or empower you to defeat opponents and pursue the quest.
