A ruby was discovered at an ancient ruin. Compared to other stones excavated at dig sites across the empire this gem appeared to house a far greater power, and with that power, an important role to play.

Chain (player character) sensed the ruby's purpose, and decided to embark on a quest to return it to its original place in the ruins. Her now former allies, however, pursue her to take it back.
 

○Command the Chains!

The player character (Chain) uses whipping techniques to control chains as her weapon.
