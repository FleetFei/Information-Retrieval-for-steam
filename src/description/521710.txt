							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. 

In this third round of releases we offer "Romance of the Three Kingdoms III," third release in the series.
The battle for unification moves from a Force base to a City base. Players issue orders to their retainers to effectively protect and expand their city, while simultaneously trying to unify the 46 main cities spread across China. With diverse elements like battlefields, infantry, horsemen, crossbowmen, morale, time limits, climate and so on to take into account, players enjoy battle with complex battle situations.
