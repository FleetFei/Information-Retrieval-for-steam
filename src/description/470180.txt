							Scenes were cut from the 2013 iOS release of Revolution 60 due to production costs and time. For the Special Edition, these scenes have been produced and added into the game. These new scenes explain Amelia's background, and explain how Crimson 09 was freed on N313. 

A core principal of Revolution 60s game design is your choices should be emotionally difficult to make. Because we cut these scenes, a large number of gamers sided with Amelia and felt Minuete was a villain. These scenes add context to who Amelia is, why N313 went off course, and will leave you asking if she's someone you can trust. This is the Revolution 60 you were meant to play.

Revolution 60 Special Edition also allows you to choose which of the 24 endings you'd like to see after completing the game. According to playtesters, our most powerful ending is the one where you fail your mission and everyone dies. Now, you can see that ending without playing through the game again.
