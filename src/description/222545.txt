							The second-generation Deutsche Bahn ICE 2 is synonymous with stylish high speed train travel in Germany, and now you can take control of this cool express train in Train Simulator.The ICE 2 is the second class of high speed train serving the German railway network, built between 1995 and 1997 as an enhanced high speed unit to its predecessor, the ICE 1. Its main purpose was to enable smaller train units to be built which could be coupled to or uncoupled from other units as needed. The resulting ICE 2 featured one power car, six passenger cars and an unpowered cab car with a top speed of 174mph (280km/h), instead of two power cars and up to 14 passenger cars as was the consist of the ICE 1.The ICE 2 is similar in appearance externally to the ICE 1 but an airline-style seating arrangement provides enhanced passenger accommodation over its predecessor. The ICE trains are also fitted with a high standard of technology, including audio jacks for on-board music and radio, full air conditioning and some seats benefiting from seat-back video displays.In total, more than 40 eight-car units have been built and each has passenger capacity for almost 400 people.
