In this deceptively simple game, you'll have to deal with a shifting screen, multi-colored patterns of increasing speed and complexity, and an unrelenting countdown timer synced to brain-pumping music.Features:six uniquely challenging levelshighly addictive gameplaycaptivating electronic soundtrackminimalistic game designobsessive global leaderboardsaccurate pantone color reproductionnon-stop action
