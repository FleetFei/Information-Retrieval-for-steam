							Humankind has faced earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and hurricanesâ€”but the most dangerous natural disaster is a weather phenomenon known as the "Tornuffalo."

A "Tornuffalo" is formed when a layer of warm, moist air meets a layer of cold, dry air which meets a herd of angry buffalo.

Note: A true meteorozoologist would explain that "buffalo" is an informal term that, in this case, refers to American bison.

Dodge fire hydrants, vans and even bison in this room-scale VR game. Hit gems to score points. Make sure to have ample space, and play with the "chaperone grid" on so you don't run into a wall!
