							The Source Filmmaker (SFM) is the movie-making tool built and used by us here at Valve to make movies inside the Source game engine. Because the SFM uses the same assets as the game, anything that exists in the game can be used in the movie, and vice versa. By utilizing the hardware rendering power of a modern gaming PC, the SFM allows storytellers to work in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get environment so they can iterate in the context of what it will feel like for the final audience.To get started, just click the button above to install. The SFM includes all the base game assets from Team Fortress 2 along with assets from some of the first “Meet the Team” short films.ResourcesOnce you're up and running, here are some general resources for finding help and learning how to get the most out of the Source Filmmaker.Official Wiki DocumentationFrequently Asked QuestionsVideo TutorialsCommunity DiscussionsHow to file bug reports
