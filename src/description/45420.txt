							Try yourself as an air traffic controller and direct planes to safe landing! Can you land airplanes without crashing them? Can you be as good as the real people who run the show when you are flying? ;)
This is your time to excel and take control of ever more challenging airspaces to navigate planes in! Buckle up as things heat up fast when more and more planes will arrive and rely on you for guidance. 
Can you safely navigate the 27 individual levels?
How far you can you go on the 3 endless levels?
