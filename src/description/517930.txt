							You are about to begin a tour of some of the strangest real estate ever placed on the market: The Castles of Dr. Creep. 
Your goal: to complete your tour alive. Your visit to each of the 13 castles will be timed, so don' t dawdle. 
You can enter the castles alone. But you may find it a bit more comforting to have a friend along. With two players this be-comes a game where cooperation, not competition, is what counts.
