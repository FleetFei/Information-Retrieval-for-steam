							The Black Libram of NatarusA Castles & Crusades Library module for Fantasy GroundsCastles & Crusades Quick Start Rules (Free)The Black Libram of Nartarus is a unique new installment to the Castles & Crusades fantasy role playing game. It is a book of wicked secrets, intended not as a supplement for the player characters to use for their own devices, but instead as a tool for the Castle Keeper to unleash new levels of magic, monsters and mayhem upon her jaded and unsuspecting players. The spells and items contained within this book are all of a decidedly wicked and evil nature.The Black Libram of Nartarus has its genesis in the Haunted Highlands campaign setting. The deities, items, rituals, and villains mentioned upon these pages are decidedly referenced from that setting. The magical lore found here is suitable for any mature themed campaign setting, played in by players mature enough to understand and accept its decidedly dark themes.Beyond Castles & Crusades, the magic items and spells within this Libram may be of use in any fantasy role playing game with little work on the part of the game master.Conversion by: Alan NeilsonReleased on October 12, 2010. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 2.9.9 and higher.Requirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate License and a one time purchase of the Castles & Crusades ruleset.
