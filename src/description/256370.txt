							Finally: official Motocross is back! Put yourself to the test, racing in the two MXGP championships with all the riders and bikes from the MX1 and MX2 categories! Take up the challenge from the promising young MX2 riders and the MX1 champions, and join them on the tracks!
Race on the official championship tracks, faithfully reproduced for the first time in a Motocross game. Get yourself noticed in your Debut Season to attract offers from the official teams and launch your career in MX2. Race your way through the events and, with the right results, you'll be able to aspire to an offer in MX1 to take on the heroes of Motocross.
Take full control of your bike with dual stick control: the advanced game physics allows for separate control of the bike and the rider. Jump, scrub and whip! It's all in your hands!
