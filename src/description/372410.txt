
							About This Game
							Dungeoncraft is a fantasy real time strategy game featuring multiplayer sandbox survival type gameplay, dynamic world expansion, and 3D grid based digging and building.

It does allow for direct control over your units, having indirect orders only for convenience' sake.

Craft weapons, raid dungeons for epic loot and mighty spells, brew potions, build or dig fortifications against the computer or your friends. It's all up to you!

Play in the unique "Communications Mode", which only allows you to control your units if you supply them with orders or contact them directly with your avatar or substitutes!
