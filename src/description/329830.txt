							*The Music Machine--the follow up to The Moon Sliver--can be purchased here*The Moon Sliver is a short narrative-focused non-linear exploration game, with elements of horror.  It features a unique narrative mechanic that blurs the line between story and exploration, where interacting with objects and even simply moving around will reveal fragments of narration.  As you piece these fragments together, a story of guilt, loneliness, and faith begins to take shape.  And it becomes increasingly obvious that something is hunting you...The Moon Sliver is best thought of as an experiment in exploration-focused storytelling, blurring the line between novelette and game.  It seeks to tell a deceptively complex, poetic story in a literary fashion, through an interactive medium.  It rewards players who ask questions and actively seek to figure things out for themselves.Explore the island, keep your flashlight charged, wait for night to fall.
