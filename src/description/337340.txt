Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.Finding Paradise is the 2nd full episode of To the Moon's series. It follows the life of the doctors' new patient, Colin, as they attempt to unravel a life that is split down the middle, and fulfill a wish that appears to be self-contradictory by nature.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Like To the Moon, this is a standalone full game that does not require having played any previous games in the series.
