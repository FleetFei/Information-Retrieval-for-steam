							Begin a journey like no other, become the Ant Queen and establish your empire. 
Ant Queen is a simulation game where you breed different types of ants to ultimately conquer your surroundings and achieve a stable ant colony. 

The game focuses on a true representation of an ant colony in the wild. Just as in nature, this game provides an environment in which random events determine the outcome. It is a true ant game where you can control your units depending on your needs, as a real Queen would.

By allowing a natural progression of your colony, you really feel like your are the Queen of your ants. 
All your ants, upgrades and acquired resources within your Empire will succeed through each level, enabling you to build your own colony.
