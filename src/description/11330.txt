							Based on the award-winning mobile game of the same name, Obulis takes things to the next level by fusing highly compelling gameplay with outstanding graphics, music and state of the art physics effects.                    
					The goal of Obulis is to drop all of the colored spheres into their like-colored pots. Spheres are connected to the playfield using chains and ropes and the player must cut these constraints to put the spheres and the level in motion by the forces of gravity and physical interaction. The controls are extremely simple and intuitive. Obulis can literally be learned in seconds, but the puzzles will keep you thinking for hours.
