							We’ve crafted a beautiful universe for you to uncover and explore at your own pace. Fly through levels, dodging and evading enemies before they have a chance to react. Or explore leisurely, mastering each world and uncovering all its secrets. Either way, Ellipsis will keep you on your toes with surprises from start to finish.“It's like the best parts of Geometry Wars” - Tycho Brahe (Founder of PAX, Penny Arcade)Ellipsis is designed with a clean minimalist interface and absolutely ZERO text.
