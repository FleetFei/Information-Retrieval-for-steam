							Download the Free Bikes Pack 3 DLC and add the Aprilia RSV4 RR 2015 and the Mr Martini Ducati Flashback California to your garage!
Available in various colour schemes named after Monza and Mugello bends, the RSV4 RR has similar features to the limited-edition RSV4 RF. A replica with plenty of amazing details once exclusive to the factory version: from the engine’s external crankcases to the broad possibility of adjustment of the chassis.
In 2011, one of the most beautiful specials in the world came out: the Mr Martini Ducati Flashback California. Starting from a Ducati 1098R, keeping the same engine, brakes and suspension, this modified bike achieves success thanks to the lights from a Harley Davidson Fat Boy and Triumph Street Triple, and the Metzeler Racetec tyres. With its brown fuel tank and front mudguard, the Flashback California is a real supersport bike-turned café racer.
