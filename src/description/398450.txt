							Absent is a story which follows the character of young-adult and college student, Murray Schull. He and his two best friends, Eve and Steve, attend a college in which students are disappearing daily. It’s up to them to find out how this is happening, why this is happening, protect their other friends, and to put a stop to it once and for all.

This series of events began when Crystal, a three month girlfriend of Murray’s friend, Steve, disappeared on her way home from college via mysterious means. Over the course of the investigation, however, Murray realizes that the abduction of Steve’s girlfriend was not from anything of this earth. Murray is haunted by visions of the past and future, confronted with puzzles, with friends turning against each other, and all for one reason. The Reaper.
