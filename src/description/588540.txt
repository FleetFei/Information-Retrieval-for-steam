Super Lovely Planet aims to bring the old school difficulty of classic NES platformers into the third dimension.What’s the gameplay like?It’s a 3D precision platformer where you jump around and defeat baddies. It’s difficult and unforgiving. You will die a lot.What special moves do I have at my disposal?None. There is only the jump button. You can crawl on the ground slowly or jump around to move faster.Is there a plot or story?Yes, but the game never tells you about it.Do we get a cast of memorable characters?Some NPCs have a line of dialogue. Others might even be wearing hats.Do we get to defeat an “evil mastermind”?Haha, no. But he's got a few things to say if you can find him!
