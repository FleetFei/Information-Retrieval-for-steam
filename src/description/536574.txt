							Detroit is home to the busiest airport in the state of Michigan. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (KDTW) is the second largest Delta Airlines hub in terms of daily flights. Detroit Metro and the many other smaller airports make this a complex and busy environment for pilots.  Even outside of the downtownâ€™s boundaries, there are some fascinating sights from the air: the Dearborn test track, a military airport on the shores of Lake St. Clair, and islands with airports scattered along the St. Clair and Detroit rivers. These islands are home to thousands of vacation homes that can often only be reached by air or boat.Features:Aerial image coverage with up to 20cm/pix resolution Harsens Island with the complete river delta of the St. Clair River More than 1,050 major buildings included 121,897 autogen objects placed realistically Highly detailed and customized mesh terrain Ambassador Bridge crossing the river into Canada Five detailed heliportsMajor airports in and around the city as well as the islands are covered with new high res ground images with customized mesh terrain (no new building structures added): KDTW - Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport KDET - Coleman A.
