Everything from the machines used daily, to the food that is eaten, is ultimately dependent on the oil. The citizens of Cordeus are so hungry for oil that the once abundant population of Sky Whales is dwindling. At current rate, the noble species will face certain extinction in a few short years. To avoid falling back into the dark ages, civilization must find a new source of energy. It is said that an ancient people named the Aetherkin had exotic sources of energy. Energy more powerful than anything any human has ever seen. Unfortunately, research related to the Aetherkin is strictly forbidden by law. In an attempt to save humanityâ€™s way of life, YOU have been secretly hired to uncover this ancient energy source.HighlightsFreedom & CreativityExplore, create and destroy anything!A Dynamic Procedural WorldSteampunk AirshipsConnect With Snowed InJoin the community!
