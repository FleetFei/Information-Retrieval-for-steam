
							About This Game
							Grow trees to climb up the floating islands back to your home, armed only with a watering can.

Careful thought must be used to know where and when to plant and grow the trees. They require sunlight on their leaves and water on their roots to grow.

Meanwhile, some nasty birds fly past you to offer "encouraging" words. As the trees grow, so must your resilience.

It should be noted that this is a difficult game, both from a puzzle and execution standpoint. I hope you find enjoyment in the challenge.
