							The third expansion for Construction Simulator 2015 reaches for the sky. High-rise buildings have long been an impressive symbol of modernity and progress, and their sillouettes still shape the skylines of many large cities. This is why it is high time that we include them in Construction Simulator 2015! With this DLC, you will receive two exciting new missions in which you will build a modern apartment building and a high-rise apartment block. You need the main game to play this DLC. If you want to experience the missions with all of their intermediate steps, we recommend you also download the expansions Liebherr 150 EC-B and Liebherr LB 28. These include the Liebherr 150 EC-B 8 Litronic tower crane and Liebherr LB 28 drilling rig, which will make the construction of the high-rise buildings even more realistic.
