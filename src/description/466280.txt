							This is my first published game, made using Unity and Playmaker.

Super cube smash is a rhythmic action game that generates music as you play. 

It is set on the mysterious ancient spaceship 'The Dwarfstone' where the most peculiar and unfortunate of events have occurred. 

Your mission is to find the core of the ship and destroy the source of the acidic alien cube swarm, before it grows to a concentration beyond your control. 

Super Cube Smash is a very difficult single player challenge, with an official steam leader board.
