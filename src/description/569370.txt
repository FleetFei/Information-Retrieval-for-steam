							Bitdude is the classic story of our favorite little dot-chomper but from another perspective. Sure, eating dots and fruit to get more points seemed harmless, but did you ever stop to think about their lives?

In Bitdude, players play as the "bit", trying to survive Chompman's unrelenting hunger. Try to obtain the best score in each level by escorting your fellow bits to safety and nom'ing on the fruit before Chompman can.
