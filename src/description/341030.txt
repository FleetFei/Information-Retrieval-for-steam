To do so, you must capture regions over the world, and defeat your enemies in battle.  The world has about 130 regions open to conquest. The regions have variable income and VP values (set randomly in the Standard scenario) and unknown until conquered or spied upon. Each region not owned by a Major Power usually has an independent Minor country owning and defending it. Each Major country is controlled by a human player or the computer, or is designated neutral and then acts as a Minor country.Hotseat play is possible, with an option to limit to 4.00 minutes the playing time per player. Each game turn represents roughly one season. Game lasts till victory conditions are achieved.Scenarios: game offers 3 scenarios: one starting in the year 1880 with an historical setting, one in 1914 with historical positions, and an open ca-1870 standard where nation only own their starting home territories (free-for-all non-historical) The game has 3 main phases, each player entering them in sequence, i.e. Build Phase (Spring only, with: Army & Navy Construction, Fortification, Economic Aid, Espionage, Subversion),  Movement Phase (Army & Navy),  and Combat Phase.Gameplay of each phase is rather simple and straightforward, as follows:Army and Navy Build Phase (Spring):  Create new armies and fleets in your Supply CentersFortification Phase (Spring): Fortify army units (except in Supply Centers which are already fortified). Economic Aid Phase (Spring): Lend money to other Major countries; which is added to their Treasury. Or Lend money to neutral Minor countries; which they use immediately to build armies.Espionage Phase (Spring): Learn the approximate (not always accurate) army strength and the income of a Minor country or of an region controlled by a Major country. And the regionâ€™s VP value Subversion Phase (Spring): Spend money to bribe a Minor country's army, weakening the country's defense or causing a coup (giving you control of the said country in return).Movement Phase (All turns): Move armies to adjacent regions only. Move navies alone or with armies from one port to another (or carry regiments to amphibious landings on enemy holdings). Combat Phase (All turns): up to twenty rounds of battle; each consists of naval (if ships are present) then land battles
