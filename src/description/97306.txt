							Koth’s fully unlocked “Strength of Stone” red deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Koth is a vulshok from the Hammer Tribe on Mirrodin, a red-aligned Planeswalker with the ability to move mountains and melt iron. Like Koth himself, the creatures he summons draw power from the surrounding mountains. This deck’s has fearsome offensive capabilities; often the amount of damage you can deal is limited only by the mana you have available. Your opponents will be battered, bruised, and most importantly, defeated.
