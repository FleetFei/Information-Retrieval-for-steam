							Induction is an abstract puzzle game about time travel and paradoxes. As you master its logic, Induction aims to rewire how you think about cause and effect.Across more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.Accompanying Inductionâ€™s minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer, broadcaster, and Gotye collaborator, Tim Shiel.Praise for Induction"A mind-bending foxtrot of timelines." - Levi Rubeck, Kill Screen"Induction hurt my brain. It still hurts my brain, but there is no question that the game is brilliant." - Jacob Wood, IndieHangover"Leads the player down the path of exploration and discovery as they are forced to communicate with the game on its terms." - John Lindvay, BigSushi
