One might think a Meleon would be content to disappear, only to strike where and when the opponent expects it least. But that doesn’t take into account the Meleon’s ‘playful’ nature. Meleons take great pleasure in gaining victory through surprise attacks, master strokes, or simply through apparently insane maneuvers.Meleons may draw extra cards at the start of their turn.A body studded with horns and gemstones; a thick, tough hide that deters even the bravest; innumerable feet bedecked with claws: such is a Kwartz. Large crystals, supple as scales and studding his back, form a gleaming bunker. That’s how Drakoneer leads his Kwartz into combat: biting as the wind, fast as an avalanche, a Kwartz is also capable of rising into the air to pierce his opponents with a laser-like Fury.Kwartz win +100 armor bonus depending on the latter type of attack they used.
