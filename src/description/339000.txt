ABOUT OUR TEAM

We are a group of friends that decided to make a game together, we have been modding for years before that for other games.  We all come from pretty much the same game, and joined up to make this game, and support the Ukraine.  We decided the name of the game because ninja's are cool, and we had a couple Ukraine's in the group (At the time, they have now since been busy with their lives over the time of development, and our team has shrunk.) However we press on, and have completed our 1st game. We are a team of 4 main members, that are working our best to provied the best entertainment for price.  We hope you enjoy our game, and any questions can ask us anytime, we are really friendly :)
