							Introducing the awaited KADOKAWA official resource series from the RPG Maker MV developer team! The first Japanese trilogy is packed with sounds and tilesets to express themes of "light" "darkness" and "twilight" in a Japanese flavor. These resources are suitable not only for Japanese RPGs but also just right to present a cyber appearance. Also, as a special perk for buying, we've resized battler data from XP to fit MV and included several pieces in each package.Materials included in Japanese Resource Pack No.1-1 "Festival of Light"- BGMMain Theme / Field 1 /Field 2 / Field 3 /Victory Theme 1Victory Theme 2 /Festival 1 / Festival 2 /Peaceful Moment / Setting Out- BGSFestival 1 / Festival 2 / Festival 3 /Festival 4Festival 5 / Festival 6 / Festival 7 /Festival 8- MEBattle Victory Jingle 1 / Battle Victory Jingle 2 /Get Item 1Get Item 2 / Mission Accomplished- SELantern 1 / Lantern 2 / Windmill / Festival Float 1 / Festival Float 2 /Festival Float 3Mirror 1 / Mirror 2 / Ascent / Electric Light Monitor / Neon Tube / Vending Machine- TilesetsFestival Stall, Portable Shrine, Paper Lantern, Neon Street Signs, etc- Bonus: RPG Maker XP Battler DataFighter07 / Cleric03 / Beast03 /Angel04 / Elemental01Sample (SoundCloud)https://soundcloud.com/rpg-maker/festival-of-light* This resource pack is one part of a trilogy of Japanese resources.
