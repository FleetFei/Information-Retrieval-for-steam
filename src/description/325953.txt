							Packed with both character and atmosphere, China Clay for Export is set in one of the most picturesque counties of England and offers a very intensive and interesting railway experience.The extraction of China Clay in Cornwall dates back to the 18th Century and remains a valuable resource to this day. The chosen route encompasses parts of three different railway lines.Par to Bugle is a section of the historic former Cornwall Mineral Railway, which has become known locally as the 'Atlantic coast line' - and terminates in Newquay. The Great Western Mainline between Lostwithiel and Par carries London to Penzance, via Bristol, passenger services as well as a wealth of china clay traffic.One of the most scenic freight only lines in Britain has to be the journey from Lostwithiel to Fowey Docks (Carne Point). Clay from many different parts of Cornwall and Devon is carried by rail to Fowey where it is loaded on to waiting ships from all parts of the globe.This is your chance to sign-on at St Blazey Depot; jump aboard your locomotive for the day and head off to Rocks Dryers to pick up a train of china clay. Can you manage to get this heavy train to Carne Point and return with empties whilst observing all speed limits, along the steep gradients and twisting lines?The China Clay for Export route has been significantly upgraded by Creative Rail for its release on Steam, including improvements to scenarios, Quick Drive functionality, new Treffry Viaduct modelled from scratch, improved platform models, and rain occlusions added to bridges, tunnels and rock dryers.ScenariosSeven scenarios for the route:	Local Stopper	Change of Plan	Tavistock Mixed Clay	The Dark Evenings Are Drawing In	Out With The Old	Blazing a Trail	Early Mornings at RocksMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
