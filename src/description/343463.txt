Desert KingdomsAll factions in the Desert Kingdoms cultural group benefit from the following traits:+2 Sanitation in all regions+15 Melee attack in desert battles Immunity to desert attritionNew Religion FeaturesBecause of the dramatic impact religious changes had on these cultures in this period, the Empires of Sand Culture Pack includes a number of changes that increase the importance of religion. There are three new religions available: Eastern Christianity, Judaism and Semitic Paganism.Each non-horde Desert Kingdoms faction has two main religions to choose between. Aksum may follow Eastern Christianity and Semitic Paganism, while Himyar may choose between Judaism and Semitic Paganism.Religion now has further-reaching effects, influencing many aspects of Desert Kingdoms campaign gameplay. It is deeply intertwined with a number of features including building chains, victory conditions, events, technologies and overall campaign bonuses:Dual religion building chainsAksum and Himyar possess a building chain for each of their main religions. They can build these buildings regardless of their faction religion. This allows players to exert greater control over their faction religion and change it reactively in response to their situation.Tier-5 barracksAksum and Himyar have two new tier-5 barracks available, one for each religion. To unlock a barracks, the faction must have 75% influence in the respective religion. These barracks buildings each provide three unique elite units as well as unlocking a variety of campaign benefits.Split victory-conditions and achievementsDesert Kingdoms factions have two sets of victory conditions, one for each of their main religions, that involve a number of units and structures related to that religion.Increased diplomatic significanceThe new religions have increased diplomatic impact, forcing the player to choose their religion carefully based on who they wish to ally with.Pleasure building-chainNon-horde Desert Kingdoms factions have access to a new industrial building-chain which provides large sums of money, but decreases your majority religion, meaning you must choose between religious stability and financial gain.Religious technologiesEach non-horde Desert Kingdoms faction has a technology chain for each of its main religions. These convey a number of religious and campaign bonuses to help you manage and optimize your religious choices.Increased Religious Discord PenaltiesThe public order penalties for religious disharmony within your provinces have been increased between the new religions, meaning that the benefits are balanced with increased risk if you fail to manage your religions correctly.Reactive Religious events (Aksum and Himyar) Two new events have been added that trigger when certain religious conditions are met, and provide you with intriguing dilemmas and missions.FactionsThe TanukhidsThe Tanukhids are a horde faction, representing a desert rebellion with a hyper-aggressive playstyle, plus a host of unique traits and features.Faction Trait: Legendary RaidersRapacious Horde: Food is obtained through settlement battles rather than buildings.Victory rallies: Every military victory spreads your fame and swells your ranks, increasing the horde’s growth.Swelling Ranks: Armies in Raiding stance gain a free Rebellion Militia unit every turn.HistoryThe Tanukhids have travelled a long way from their homelands. Originally part of the Qahtani tribal confederation, they migrated north in the aftermath of a flood which devastated their homeland, eventually leaving Arabia altogether. Coming into contact with the Roman Empire, the Tanukhids have since been employed as Roman foederati, and considered a dependable cavalry force. However, they recently rebelled against Rome following Emperor Valens' attempts to convert them from Orthodox to Arian Christianity. The Tanukhids – under their warrior queen, Mavia – fought so hard, and so fiercely, that they defeated the Romans in the field on several occasions and forced agreement to their terms. Despite the odds, these devout people have created a life for themselves as free Arabs, who pledge allegiance to none but God and their brave queen - surely all that is required to attain true greatness!Campaign featuresNew building trees While migrating, the Tanukhids have access to a completely new Horde building tree comprising 34 new buildings, each with unique artwork and campaign effects. Unique event chainA brand new event-chain guides you in your rebellion against the Romans, and leads you ultimately to settlement and the formation of an empire. Dynamic Barrack unlocksCompleting missions unlocks higher tiers of barracks and provides access to new, defecting Roman units.

Although its Ethiopian heartlands have been occupied for hundreds of years, Aksum has recently grown in size due to the hugely lucrative trade route to India and beyond, on which it sits. When a nation becomes so rich and powerful, it attracts those who wish to steal its wealth for themselves; the neighbouring Himyarites are one such adversary. As the 5th century dawns, military and religious lines have once again been drawn in the sand. Aksum enjoys Rome's favour, and the wealth of the world fills its coffers - let those who would challenge that might face Aksumite steel, and feel Aksumite strength!Campaign featuresUnique Event ChainA unique event chain challenges you to claim a series of resources in exchange for unlocking new spice buildings, and Gupta Indian influenced units. Unit Roster The Aksumite roster focuses on powerful spears and shock troops. They are lightly armoured but capable of devastating optimal damage. They also have a number of unusual troops, such as hunting dog archers and hybrid axe/bow units.Abunas Guard – Heavy defensive spear cavalry (Eastern Christian only)Adana Marksmen – Elite Warhound bowmenAdana Trackers – Warhound BowmenAfar Camel Riders – Guerilla deployment mounted Camel SwordsmenAfar Raidmasters – Shock infantry with exceptional attack (Semitic Pagan only)Afar Swordsmen – Shock infantry with high attackBeher’s Chosen – Heavy shotel unit (Semitic Pagan only)Bet Giorgis Cavalry – Medium spear cavalry with exceptional attack (Eastern Christian only)Elite Tor Warriors – Heavy defensive spears Marz Archers – Snipe (fire from cover) archersMasqal Spearmen – High armour-piercing, high attack spearmen (Eastern Christian only)Mounted Marz Archers – Mounted archers Ras Guard – Heavy defensive spear unit with precursor Sons of the Invincible Mahrem – High base damage, high attack spearmen (Semitic Pagan only)Spice Guard – Hybrid two-handed axe unit with bowSpice Warriors – Light khanda wielderT’or Warriors – Defensive spearmen HimyarHimyar is a powerful Arabian kingdom on the peninsula. The Himyarites survive in their arid lands through a series of specialised adaptations to the desert.Faction Trait: Desert WarriorsFatigue rate: -15% for all warriors.Marib Dam: Unique fertility-boosting building in faction capital.Desert Saboteurs: Stops foreign replenishment in regions where armies are present.HistoryThe Sabaean Kingdom is diminished and, in its place, Himyar ascends! The victorious Shamir Yuhar'ish has declared himself "King of Saba, Dhu Raydan and of Hadramawt and Yamanat" at his coronation, and no one dares challenge this proclamation. Sabaean local power was based, in large part, on overland trade routes, but Himyar has discovered and exploited new sea trade routes to India, making it the principle economic power in southern Arabia. Much like neighbouring Aksum, Himyar controls the flow of trade along major trade routes to the east. The militaristic Himyarites relentlessly pursue their aims, particularly when facing the hated Aksumites. Himyar has even recently converted to Judaism, seemingly only to fuel the constant war that rages between them. It has sacrificed much to hold onto a powerful position during a tumultuous time, and will surely seize the future by force of will alone!Campaign featuresMarib Dam: Unique EventsThe Marib Dam was an engineering marvel of the ancient world, though it was famously breached. Playing as Himyar, players will periodically be presented with options to make repairs. Leaving the dam untended brings the risk of floods, and repair is costly – however, in good working order, the dam can bring a powerful series of benefits.Unit RosterHardy and weathered, Himyar forces are drilled to feats of great stamina. Their roster is built around a series of tanking defensive units to represent their desert hardiness.
