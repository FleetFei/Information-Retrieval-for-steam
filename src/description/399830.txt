							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Starstorm expansion.Unicorn Nibbs is a unicorn warrior in service to the Unicornhood of Coba. This magical group was bound to the Ohmigosh dimension who, as soon as the Starstorm ripped a hole in the continuum, started an invasion of cuddliness.Right after going through the portal, Nibbs' ship gently touched down on the space station in a pink cloud of smoke. Scouting around, she mistook Gnaw's tail for a juicy piece of lovely unicorn candy. After cheerfully biting down on the treat, the startled Gnaw led her right back to the Awesomenauts who managed to convince her to stay with a wide variety of exotic treats, lots of petting, and by brushing her manes.This DLC contains a custom skin for Nibbs in Awesomenauts: Starstorm.
