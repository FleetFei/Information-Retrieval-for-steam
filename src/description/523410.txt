							Ozapell Basic is a programming language simple enough to teach the basics of programming -- while powerful enough to develop playable retro games. 

The graphics environment and interface are loosely based on early 1980s color home computers.

The programming language is heavily inspired by modern languages (especially javaScript) while using BASIC keywords for simplicity.

The supplied library provides enough functionality to create simple games and graphical demonstrations.

Ozapell Basic was designed to be as simple as possible while providing a variety of features. Intended as an educational learning toy for teaching programming basics. It could also be fun for someone who wants to program but doesn't want to learn a complicated modern language.
