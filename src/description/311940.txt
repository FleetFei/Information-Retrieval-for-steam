							P-3 Biotic is a twin-stick shooter where you must pilot your nano-ship, the MK4s, inside a petri dish to defend an entity growing at the center of the dish, the Nucleus, from hordes of invading bacteria. In most other shooters in this genre, you only have to look out for yourself. Well that's too easy we say. In P-3 Biotic, if the Nucleus dies, then it's game over. You'll find yourself switching from frantic defence to all out attack as you fight a desperate battle to keep the Nucleus alive. It doesn't help that you can use the energy stored in the Nucleus to over-power your weapons, turn your ship into a projectile, or release a devastating AOE shockwave, tempting you to walk a fine line between success and failure. Collect energy dropped by dead bacteria to keep the Nucleus powered up, but never forget it's defenceless while you're away.
