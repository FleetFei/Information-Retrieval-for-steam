Even rotten food does not just disappear but has to be composted. During the game you also have to manage energy, agriculture and labor and each aspect relies on certain real world aspects. Lead a successful settlement. Acquire a fortune of goods, keep your citizens satisfied and improve the daily routine with new technology and resources. Then your reputation will increase and strangers will take notice. You will be visited by nomads who want to join your tribe and merchants who want to offer a trade. But beware, big attention will also lead to threats. How you will deal with it is up to you! Either arm up or focus on strong allies - both are viable strategies.Please do keep in mind that the game is still in development.Visit our Roadmap and Forum for more information.
