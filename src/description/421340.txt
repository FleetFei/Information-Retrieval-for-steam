Jackson), a lonely bail bondsman (Robert Forster), a shifty ex-con (Robert De Niro), an earnest federal agent (Michael Keaton), and a stoned-out beach bunny (Bridget Fonda) have in common? They're six players on the trail of a half million dollars in cash! The only questions are...who's getting played...and who's gonna make the big score? Combining an explosive mix of intense action and edgy humor, Quentin Tarantino's crime thriller introduced Pam Grier and Robert Forster to a new generation of filmgoers and earned Forster an OscarÂ® nomination.
