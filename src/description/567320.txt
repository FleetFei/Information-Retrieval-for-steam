							VThree (V3) is the rocket jumping, gravity field floating, fast paced first person platformer you didn’t know you needed. Combining the best of DeFRaG and 3d platforming plumbers, V3 is as rewarding as it is insanely difficult.In V3 there are no clip walls, no out of bounds areas. If you can get to it, you can explore it, and maybe even use what you’ve found to shave precious milliseconds off your run. Some of the best parts are off to the side and out of the way, and by exploring you can find better, faster lines to the goal.Featuring Fully featured Singleplayer campaign Unlockable abilities to advance your play Persistent Multiplayer leaderboards to see how you stack up against friends Dedicated multiplayer servers In-game multiplayer chatAbout Early AccessV3 is in Early Access, and is committed to making the most out of that.
