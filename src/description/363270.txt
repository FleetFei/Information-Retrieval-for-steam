O3DX will be the new game you love..What is O3DX?O3DX is an offroad racing and physics obstacle game with a whole new approach. It blends the fun factor and playability of side scroller racing games with the artistic splendour of free roam full 3d games that utilise cinematic camera angles. O3DX is the first game to employ this new type of genre. This is not a free roam game. It behaves like a side scroller but all action happens in 3D space with 360 degree camera angles.If I purchased early access do I also get the ‘official’ version?Yes!
