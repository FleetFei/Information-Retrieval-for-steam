							Pressure is mounting on the Air Force concerning their most secretive base, Area 51, used to house elusive “long-term visitors.” Bowing to political and public pressure, two reporters are granted limited access to the facility. But when one of the “visitors” uses the reporters as a chance to liberate himself and fellow captives, Area 51 turns from a secure government base to a horrifying destination of terror.
