							Coil is an experimental "autobiographical" game that plays out more like a song or painting then an actual "game". I was basically trying to create an experience that put the player into an open minded space and let them question not only what the game was about, but what a game can actually be.                    
					Coil uses mouse movements only, no keys or clicking is involved at all.
