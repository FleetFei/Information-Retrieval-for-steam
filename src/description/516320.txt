							This soundtrack is made up of soft, synth tracks traversing a story of fantasy, adventure, love, strife, and mystery.

When brainstorming about the aesthetic of the "Echoes of the Fey" visual novel, our team put a lot of thought into the music style. The genre of the game is an unusual mixture in and of itself. For some important story reasons (specifically the motivation behind the Human/Leshin war), there was always going to be a light steampunk element to the world. But we aimed for a variation on traditional steampunk. The fledgling machinery of the world wasnâ€™t powered by coal or literal steam, but magic drawn from Fey rifts. It was clean energy, and it didn't visibly pollute the world around it. Meanwhile, there was also pure magic in the world and other motifs from traditional fantasy. 

We decided to aim for a musical style that would reflect fantasy with an ethereal sci-fi touch. We looked at a lot of 80's fantasy movies for inspiration, which merged synth or retro instruments with magic and epic stories. The result is the soundtrack as it is today, including a vocal song performed by the leading voice actress of the game.
