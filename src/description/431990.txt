							This is a story of a man who has been closed in his own subconscious. In medicine we call that state "locked-in syndrome". The main character is going to solve all the riddles of his own conscious and find the way out or he'll stay there for good. 
We're gonna live the life of a man who has been left alone in a really weird world where everything is happening according to its own rules. Who are we, what are we doing here, where are we going and what is this place we'll find out during the game.
