							Grand Class Melee 2 is an RPG job system arena fighter featuring a huge roster of over 60 character classes to battle with. Drawing inspiration from JRPG favorites and the competitive classics of console multiplayer, players progress through 8 intensifying rounds of fierce combat, gain new abilities each round and build up their arsenals to the top of the class tree.To bolster the slash/thrust/parry weapons-based melee, every player pairs the new ability of their chosen job with one earned from an earlier job for an ever-evolving, two-fisted loadout. With up to 4 players mixing & matching, the possibilities are sprawling!The fight gets fleshed out further by bots, teams, custom scoring, deeply tweakable procedurally generated battlefields and beyond with additional gameplay options.GCM2 is in EARLY ACCESS (v1.1.6), offering a stable, configurable, extensively tested couch multiplayer brawl supporting up to 4 players on gamepads & keyboard.Features in Early Access development include:Steam Workshop Class Tree Modding that gives players the power to create & customize classes (live as of v1.1.0!)FFA & Team Quickbattle Modes with leaderboard support to bring fame to your hard-fought victories (live as of v1.0.16 & v1.0.14!)Spectator Mode to set the AI on autopilot and relax as the melee unfolds (live as of v1.0.12!)Survival Mode where players stand their ground against waves of enemies (in development!)Practice Mode to climb the class tree in comfort and test abilities freely (in development!)In-game Unlockables that reward your blood, sweat and other fluids (in development!)Achievements & Trading Cards to round out the Steam game experience (live as of v1.0.16 & v1.0.13!)In the tradition of Street Fighter II, Warcraft II, Bomberman 2, Seiken Densetsu 2 and other greats you may not have played until they hit with part two, Gigatross presents Grand Class Melee 2 -- a game for those who like a little variety in their job system arena combat.
