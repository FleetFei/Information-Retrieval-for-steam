							Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope bring you the epic original music composed for Desktop Dungeons. Contains over an hour of classically-influenced adventure melodies. Feel the chills of the Creeplight Ruins, thrill in the Tower of Gaan-Telet and exercise caution when operating heavy machinery. Do not apply to burned areas, not a flotation device.
