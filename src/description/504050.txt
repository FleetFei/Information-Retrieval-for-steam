What you build determines your chances of survival and increases your action radius and potential to uncover more materials. Your options include over a hundred building blocks to choose from and use to create nearly anything your imagination can come up with. Paired with working physics for land-based vehicles and fliers.ExplorationYou may have explored your immediate surrounding, but a few hundred kilometers away or a thousand meters higher, things could be radically different. Unlocking advanced technology allows you to explore the more hazardous places where you wouldn't survive before. The planets are up to 120 kms in diameter, with biomes changing as you travel from pole to pole.SurvivalLiving the nomadic life is always full of danger and adventure. But mostly danger.

As long as you overcome radiation and poisonous atmosphere, avoid being slashed to pieces, frozen to death, eaten alive, starved and generally ended, that is.Planet Nomads has been successfully Kickstarted and is being developed together with our community of Nomads.
