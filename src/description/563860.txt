
							About This Game
							The Edgelands is an atmospheric adventure set in the present day, based on real and imagined folklore.

Starting off in a house in the forgotten rural backwoods beyond the City, you soon find yourself exploring an uncanny rustic twilight landscape in which familiar rural landmarks overlap with otherworldly occurrences, creating a dream-like blurring of the ordinary and the supernatural.

An evocative electronic soundscape responds and adapts to your actions as you interact with the environment and it’s inhabitants, and the choices you make on your journey shape the manner in which the narrative unfolds.

The Edgelands is a proud recipient of funding from Fundbetter, the initiative set up by Failbetter Games, developers of Sunless Sea and Fallen London
