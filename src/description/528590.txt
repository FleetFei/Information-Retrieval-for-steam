							Gaming the Real World Can games change the world? With cities everywhere struggling to cope with the population growth that increased urbanisation brings, can video games be harnessed to help the residents, especially young people, take part in planning, and fixing their own cities?Today public spaces and entire cities are being designed, planned and played through the medium of games. The result of this ‘civic gamification’ is that city architecture and urban planning is being democratized. Cities have become the ground zero for digital innovation and the debate about how our cities evolve has suddenly gone viral.We follow three game companies navigating the space where urban planning and gaming meet. Lydia Winters at the game developer Mojang, the creators of Minecraft, Paradox Interactive and the game Cities: Skylines and José Sanches and his indie game Block’hood. How will our cities look in 20 - 100 years time?Credit List:Director:Anders Eklund Director of photography:Matthew GormlyMike ParryAdditional Camera:Emil MarczakSven Lindahl Anton Ljungberg Love Strandell, KATLA Studios Vu Bui Lydia Winters Archive Footage:Shutterstock Research:Fredrik JohanssonRick Jacobs Narrator:Dan RichardsonComposer and Soundmix:Pär Davidsson Composer Block'hood:Selma Mutal Productions musicUpright Music Graphics:Ola Blomgren, Redloop Colorgrade:Ted Karlsson, Kromofor Production Manager:Hedvig Lundgren Editor:Rodney Guest Online Editor:Max von Reis Logger:Margarita KradjianConsultant Film i skåne:Lisa Nyed Producer:Mats Billberg JohanssonExecutive Producers:Henrik JohanssonKevin LeeCast:Lydia WintersVu BuiJörgen HallströmDavid BergströmEmil AnderssonPontus WesterbergThomas MelinSusana Meza GrahamJakob MuntheJohn RickneKaroliina KorppooMartina HallikainenJose SanchesGentaro MakinodaJason KingBiayna BogosianEric GordonSusanna PollackAsk BurakRichard LemarchandPhil HoadCharles GachangaTaylor HarrisVikas MehtaHarrison S.
