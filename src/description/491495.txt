							A technological tour de force of epic proportions, the legend of the XB-70 Valkyrie™ very nearly surpasses the performance of this extraordinary aircraft. Built in the 1960s as a result of a USAF proposal for a supersonic bomber with high subsonic cruising speed and supersonic dash capabilities, the massive XB-70™ was to have carried the same bombload as the B-52 Stratofortress™ at a higher supersonic speed than the Air Force's current strategic bomber, the B-58 Hustler™. A later requirement specified that the plane be able to fly the entire mission at Mach 3.0 or greater, with a range of up to 10,500 miles and a maximum gross weight of 490,000 pounds. In the event, technology quickly relegated the Valkyrie to the role of supersonic research testbed and flagship of the USAF's public relations fleet. Ground-to-air missiles and advanced radar made the XB-70's supersonic mission impossible. The bomb bay of the aircraft was instead packed with data acquisition equipment.Features High quality exterior model with detailed texturesLarge set of custom XB-70 gauges in 2D panel and virtual cockpitHighly authentic flight model with carefully illustrated checklistAnimated folding wingtipsAnimated afterburner petalsAuthentic gear retraction sequenceAutomatic (on throttle) staged animated afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boostSimulated XB-70 soundset includedPilots togglableAutomatic smoke trail, wing surface vapour flash and canard tip vortices effects
