							"Have you ever looked into a mirror carefully? How do you know whether the person looking at you from the other side is yourself or someone else inside the mirror?"RETSNOM is an inventive pixel art puzzle platformer that allow players to break the map by mirroring sections of the level, and rearranging it on the fly.You have a daughter. She is unfortunately infected by a zombie virus. The only way to save your daughter is to visit the future laboratory to steal the medicine that is expected to be made by your colleagues. But the future research team is hiding in a maze using mirrors. They've fortified the maze using different features of a mirror in each level. Mirrors have several features:1. Mirrors seem to reflect objects left to right.2. Frost on the mirror's surface makes image invisible.3. Concave mirrors invert the image upside down. All of these rules are used to decorate puzzles. Players should understand the way how mirrors flip the world to solve the stages. The ability to bend the world to player's will is a very cool gameplay mechanic, which rewards experimentation as players make their way through this rather sinister world.
