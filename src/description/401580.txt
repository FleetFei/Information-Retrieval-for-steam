							An assembled, linear version of the dynamic in-game music, heavily influenced by 16-bit sounds of the Super Nintendo. Featuring two versions of the music, as a “side A”: Serenity, a SNES-style symphonic mix, and “side B”: Chaos, a heavy electronic mix. The worlds are the same structure and duration, just viewed through the lens of a different Fate. The dynamic in-game music is comprised of up to 16 instrument channels, which change volume and form to evolve along with the players’ choices. Each track roughly marks a point in the game where another fate’s temple has been added to the world, highlighting the relationship between the different voices.
