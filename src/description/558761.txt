							Introducing the awaited KADOKAWA official resource series from the RPG Maker MV developer team! The first Japanese trilogy is packed with sounds and tilesets to express themes of "light" "darkness" and "twilight" in a Japanese flavor. These resources are suitable not only for Japanese RPGs but also just right to present a cyber appearance.
