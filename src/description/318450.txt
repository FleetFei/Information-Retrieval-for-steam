							The Maker's Eden is a first-person hypertext adventure game presented in the style of a motion comic. You play a character trying to discover what their predefined purpose is, in a science fiction/noir inspired world filled with androids, flying cars and an early 20th century vibe.IMPORTANT: This is a 3-act episodic game. The purchase is for all 3 acts, of which act 1 is ready to be played right now. During the preparation of acts 2 and 3, we will also be releasing little mini-episodes every month that provide additional flavour and backstory to the world we have created.
