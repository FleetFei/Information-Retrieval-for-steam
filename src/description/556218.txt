							Four of the RAF’s most famous names from the 1940s come together in one package! Hawker Heroes features the classic Fury biplane, the legendary Hurricane, the fast Typhoon fighter-bomber and the formidable Tempest, which fearlessly fought against enemy jet fighters.

The Fury first flew in 1931 and with its impressive 200mph speed became the RAF’s first interceptor. Though it looks dated alongside later 1940s fighters, the Fury set new standards for performance.

The Hurricane needs no introduction, as the RAF’s most effective fighter during WW2 and stablemate to the famous Spitfire. Reliability and performance made it a favourite among crews. 

Replacing the Hurricane was the Typhoon, which brought a further step forward in performance as well as creating an effective ground attack platform. Typhoons were updated to carry rockets by the end of WW2, ushering in a new era of battle.

The Tempest entered military service in 1944 as one of the last piston-engine frontline fighters. Its outstanding performance enabled the Typhoon to engage effectively with the new generation of advanced weapons systems such as the V1 flying bomb and the emerging jet fighter threat.

Developed by First Class Simulations, Hawker Heroes for FSX: Steam Edition includes two Beginner-level missions, ‘Fury Familiarization’ and ‘Follow My Leader’, both of which feature the Hawker Fury.
