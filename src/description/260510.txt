
							About This Game
							WBM Tycoon is a fresh look in sports strategy games that combines the classic manager game with the financial management and development of a Tycoon type game.
As the Club Owner you must generate (or loan) the necessary funds in order to expand the club's facilities, raise the financial level and improve the team's roster. 
And as you remain the Manager you are still in charge of the Player's training program and when the match day comes, you have to select the team lineup, create the most appropriate strategy and find the way to victory by countering the opposing manager's plans.
