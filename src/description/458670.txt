	Underneath the sounds of skeletons, spiders and rage from your friends lies the soundtrack for Hack, Slash & Backstab. 

	James Zolyak is the mastermind behind it all. With a swath of midi instruments and a little keyboard, the music for this game was made, emulating the style of games from years gone by. Hopefully you enjoy giving it a listen as much as he did making the songs.
	
	The music itself is compressed into an album of MP3’s that can be played through the Stream Music player at any time.
