							YamaYama is a whacky party game where you complete all sorts of mini-games to collect points on your path to victory. Most of the game modes utilise the FatSuit mechanic, where characters blow out and push other players away. It is made with easy-to-learn controls, so you can play with both video game veterans and newbies. The game is functional, but we decided to release on Early Access for many reasons - please read "Why Early Access?" for an in-depth on the decision. Although we haven‘t decided on a final release price, we are certain that it will not be lower than the Early Access price. But what will the build right now bring you?•	2-4 player local and online multiplayer•	Single player with 1-3 Monkey AI bots•	An excellent new game for the party!•	24 game modes•	6 characters•	The ultimate new game for the party!Ever since we had a running prototype of YamaYama, we've been getting playtesters to play the game and give us honest opinions and pitch ideas. This has been incredibly valuable to us in the development process, and we want to continue that work. With the Early Access, we hope and will actively encourage players to give us feedback. Tell us what you feel is bad, what is good and tell us what you‘d like to see in the game. To do this, we will run a forum for everyone who buys a copy of the game. There we will read every single post and take note off your feedback. By the end of the early access process, most likely the end of November or start of December, we hope to offer a perfectly polished end-product.•	Polishing the online multiplayer•	Listening to all feedback and making sure everything is working perfectly•	www.lumenoxgames.com	•	www.facebook.com/LumenoxGames•	www.twitter.com/LumenoxGames•	Join the Discussions if you have any questions!
