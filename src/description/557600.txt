							Designed, developed, and illustrated by Jason Roberts, Gorogoa is a beautiful hand-drawn story suspended inside a completely unique puzzle. Arrange and combine lavishly illustrated panels, each one a separate interactive window into a living game world. Navigate the scene inside each panel. Align the images in adjacent panels. Solve puzzles and advance the story by stacking and connecting panels. Imagine pictures on a wall escaping their frames and joining together to create new impossible scenes. Elegantly simple and yet astonishing.
