							An incredible single-player experienceYou’re hired to hack into the most secure database on the planet by a client with big money and mysterious motives.  Uncover the mystery as you progress deeper into the system’s core in this amazingly clever puzzle platformer.  Polarity features the same type of polished gameplay found in games like Portal, but is made exclusively for experienced gamers.  You’ll need clever wits and fast reflexes to beat the system’s security and reach the world-changing prize buried deep inside. Full-featured co-op campaignPolarity also features a separate two-player local coop campaign, which supports both gamepads and mouse & keyboard.  “15 co-op campaign levels were created just for multi play, and they're just as satisfying as the solo content.”-Co-optimus.comFinally, there’s a kinetic 2 player versus mode that leverages Polarity’s core mechanics.“It's a bit like goalie vs. goalie soccer, but it's a riot. Gather the friends together, let's toss the ole cube around.”-Co-optimus.com
