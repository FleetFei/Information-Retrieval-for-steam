							Though he started as a photographer for the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock's life took a drastic turn when he was overtaken by the alien symbiote (which was previously bonded with Peter Parker himself). Calling himself Venom, Eddie had one purpose: destroy Spider-Man at any cost for costing him his job. Having become content with not obliterating Spider-Man, Venom has since served on the side of angels from time to time, calling himself a "Lethal Protector" and enacting his own twisted brand of justice on those he deems even more twisted than he.Items Included in this Pack:VenomVenom Classic (Default) CostumeVenom Hero S.T.A.S.H.
