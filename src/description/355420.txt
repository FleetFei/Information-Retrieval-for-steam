							FLAMBERGE is a "simultaneous turn-based tactics RPG". Players plan out multiple movements and attacks at once, and the turn is resolved at the same time as the enemy. The player must anticipate enemy actions in order to win. 

At heart, though, Flamberge is mostly an RPG. Players will control many different characters with different abilities and strengths, and level those characters to add new traits and abilities.
