							Age of Chivalry is a total conversion for Half-Life 2 from Team Chivalry,  a close group of friends dedicated to creating a fun, story-driven multiplayer experience set in a fantasy world in the medieval ages.					Age of Chivalry features a fast paced first person melee combat system that will take the player to a new level of immersion. Players will be able to take part in sieges, town raids and open war in a story driven game.					Story Driven Multiplayer: Our unique way of allowing the players to continue writing the story depending on the outcome of the battles.  For instance, you can siege the shore and push enemies back into the deep forests on their lands.  If your strength is great enough, you may determine the course of history by destroying their lands and laying siege to their town's castle.					Classes: We serve you with preset classes optimized for the best combined use of weapons and armor. Classes include archers, footmen, and knights.					Weapons: Diverse range of weapons, such as multiple types of daggers, swords, axes, bows, spears, and even hot oil pots. Siege Engines include Catapult, Trebuchet, Battering-ram and more.
