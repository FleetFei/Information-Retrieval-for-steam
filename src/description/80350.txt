							A new film opens to rave reviews, despite its bloody history. A beautiful uptown office remains unoccupied, despite its prime location. A downtown artist berates himself for selling out, while a Wall Street investor congratulates himself on a job well done. Just normal life in the big city? Or is somthing more sinister binding these events together Bizarre connections are a dime a dozen for the Blackwell family, but just how far back to they go? Â Medium Rosa Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone are about to find out.
