I enjoyed the artwork, the tongue-in-cheekiness, and the sense of a campy space-adventure. It's nice to have a gay-centric game, especially since most games are heavily influenced to appeal to the straight guy-gamer. - JasonIt's a whole lot of fun, as a gay guy this is the game I've wanted to play all my life! - Brian
