We have priced the game with the consideration to increase prices in the future with more content updates, somewhat like an early access title / pre-order. All proceeds will go towards game content.Early buyers get free content updates although if there isn't much interest in this genre, there's the risk of little future content. We appreciate all feedback and support (in terms of comments or reviews)!
