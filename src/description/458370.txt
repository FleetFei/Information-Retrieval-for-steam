
							About This Game
							There is no feeling greater than stepping up to the plate, with the crowd cheering, and crushing the pitch deep into left field!  Now you can live the experience with 
VR Baseball, the premier baseball game for Virtual Reality! 

With over 40 bats to choose from, stepping up to the plate and hitting homerun after homerun has never been so much fun! Increase your skill to smash lights and blow off fireworks! Engage in challenges with friends and family.  Hit homerun streaks to extend your time at bat, change the mode to goofy (or toddler), or kill the fans in the stands with devastating power shots!
 
With support for left and right-handed batters there is no excuse to not have a good time showing off your skills at bat!
