Gamers will be able to create and customise their players with an unprecedented level of control, altering players' roles, mentalities, batting positions and numerous skills to create the ultimate superstar.

Don Bradman Cricket 17 features a new lighting system that creates the most true-to-life characters yet, photo realistic skin tones, and 30 per cent more controls than in the predecessor to allow for unprecedented refinement of player visuals. For the first time, gamers will be able to give their players' tattoos enabling them to recreate their cricketing heroes and local clubs in the game with complete precision. Importing any of the 200,000 plus cricket players from the previous Don Bradman Cricket title also allows a seamless transition to the new Don Bradman Cricket 17 game for veterans making the upgrade.

For the first time ever in a cricket game, you are able to create female players. Offering the same options to create a player as males. Big Ant Studios is committed to ensuring women in Don Bradman Cricket 17 are as "completely true to the sport as is possible."
