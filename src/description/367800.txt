							As Barry the miner, scurry around the mines collecting diamonds before the ghosts can capture you.Life is hard as a miner; you have to get up early every day, get down underground and harvest gems by digging them out of the ground.It is tough, dirty work with little appreciation. It is even harder when the only mines you have access to are HAUNTED! And these ghosts are very persistent spectres.Luckily for Barry, he is not without his own tricks. Planting traps behind him to freeze these incorporeal guardians of the deeps seems to be just as important as belting walls with his pickaxe to get the gems.Featuring retro style pixel graphics Diamond Deeps harkens back to the old days of simple but addictive gameplay. Not only is Diamond Deeps a a single-player game in its own right but also the ability for gamers to make their own levels to play, share and challenge each other is one of the best ways to let your creative spirit run.Like sitting on the lounge?  No worries Diamond Deeps supports controllers and can accommodate any lounge sloth playing on their Steam Machine!
