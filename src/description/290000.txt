							DubWars is an action-packed arcade shooter that successfully combines music and gaming in a way never seen before. We've collaborated with incredible EDM and Dubstep artists to create a game that synchronizes the energetic music with fun and exciting gameplay. The music becomes your weapon as they fire in sync to the rhythm of the song, each beat firing a unique weapon. Listen to the bass, up beats, climax, and the drop of each song in order to progress through each level's difficulty. Analyze the risk and reward of collecting Wubs from destroyed enemies in order to upgrade, or just try to frantically survive the song!10 custom-built levels with amazing visuals and effects!Discover and support both up-and-coming musicians and your favorite established artists!Learn about the artists and where you can follow them, as well as download their other musicProgress through three difficulty modes by mastering the music and upgrading your shipComplete objectives and Steam achievements, collect Trading Cards, and top the leaderboards!Tracklist:Omni - Urban MetaphorDubsective - SynergySpock - Break It UpMinecraft Universe - EclipseCelldweller - Tough Guy (Tim Ismag Remix)Varien - MetalworksMinesweepa - LeviathanTotally Sick - DistortedSummer School - Choose Your WeaponNGHTMRE - MTRDJames Egbert - Menu Music
