							This preview was added to 3DMark in early 2016 while VRMark was still in development. And although this DLC will continue to be available in 3DMark for a while longer, we recommend that you check out the real thing instead.

The full version of VRMark is available to buy on Steam. 
Or try the free version by clicking 'Download Demo' on the VRMark store page.
