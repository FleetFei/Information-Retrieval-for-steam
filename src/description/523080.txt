							Footbrawl Playground is a Physics Playground with a slight Football touch where you can goof around with a Friend, spawn NPCS, Place Traps and some more stuff. Please be aware that the Game is in a very early Stage and more a tech Demo. There are actually no Football mechanics in yet - which will change with version 0.0.5 which will be out in 1 or 2 months. Please make also sure that you read this manual before you buy the game. Be aware that this game is at the moment more a ragdoll torture simulater then a Football Game.fully customizable Physics Playgrounddrivable Carslow Gravity Modeslow Motion Modecar Soccerlocal Multiplayer For 2 Playersplaceable Traps LikeBouncersHuman PinballExplosive BarrlesRampsSpinnerYou Want More?
