							SWARMRIDERS is a FREE "endless runner"+"twin stick shooter" ARCADE mashup. A "machine gun swarm surfing minigame" made as a bonus content for the UBERMOSH community.
400 years before the events of UBERMOSH:BLACK, the Blade Saint was just a mercenary gunner, shredding eyes on the backseat of a bike.

Players can expect a few minutes of elegant gameplay, responsive controls and a heart pumping original soundtrack.
