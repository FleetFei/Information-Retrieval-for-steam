
							About This Game
							MORTEM is a first person horror game, developed by Nighthood Games.

You are Timothy Collins. You arrive home late from work and enter your house. At first the silence is so deep, you realise that none of your family is home. 
But then thereâ€™s a creak in the walls and a chill down your back. The voices in the dark are almost familiar. 

Your home reverberates with revenge. MORTEM wants to play with you. Her favourite game is Hide and Seek, but beware, it comes with deadly consequences, and she might not have come alone. Toggle your lights on and off, watch out for her friend Vindicta, run and stop. Explore the house and the woods owned by the prestigious Collins family. 

The question is, who will survive?
