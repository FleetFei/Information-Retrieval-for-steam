							The popular EMD SD45 is now available for Train Simulator in three recognisable liveries of the Norfolk Southern Railway.Built between 1965 and 1971, the EMD SD45 was most at home hauling high-speed freight and intermodal services, although could occasionally be seen at the head of some passenger services. More than 1,200 models were built and operated services for a number of US railroads, although their reliability issues make them a rare sight today.Norfolk Southern’s predecessor railroads date back more than 100 years, with Norfolk & Western being formed in 1881 and the Southern Railway System forming in 1894. Norfolk Southern was created in 1982 from the merger of Southern and Norfolk & Western, with the headquarters of this new company established in Norfolk, Virginia.The EMD SD45 for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Norfolk Southern, Southern and Norfolk & Western liveries, and features five new freight wagons, including Airslide Hoppers, 50ft Boxcars, 52ft Gondolas with three loads, and Caboose.
