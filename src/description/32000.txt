							Raycatcher is an innovative new game that syncs gameplay to your favorite mp3s. Load in your entire music library and watch as the game morphs itself to match. The gameplay itself is easy to pick up, yet compelling. Rotate a cluster of colorful shapes to catch matching rays of light cast onto your screen. As you match light to shape, your cluster will expand and evolve.
