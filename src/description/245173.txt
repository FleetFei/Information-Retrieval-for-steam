Robo-Fortune is Ms. Fortune's mechanical simulacrum, created by Lab 0 to destroy the Skullgirl. Strangely, this digital doppelganger has also inherited Ms. Fortune's penchant for terrible puns.

Thanks to the incredible support of Skullgirls’ fans, Robo-Fortune is the last of five additional characters funded by Lab Zero’s Indiegogo campaign to be added to Skullgirls Encore. Robo-Fortune comes equipped with all manner of advanced weaponry, including lasers, chainsaws, and mouse missiles. And of course she is made with the same stunning, feature-quality animation and great gameplay you've come to expect from Skullgirls and Lab Zero Games!
