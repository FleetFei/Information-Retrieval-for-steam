What Lies Within is a scenario for 1-5 investigators in which a murder is only the beginning of the inexplicable occurrences in one Arkham mansion. Investigators will explore a murder scene, fend off terrible creatures, encounter strange phenomena, and investigate the noises coming from the cellar of the supposedly empty house. They must discover why the victim was murdered–and what he did with his life before it was so violently ended–in order to leave the mansion alive.
