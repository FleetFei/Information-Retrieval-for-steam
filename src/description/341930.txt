
							About This Game
							Space Station Alpha is a game where you build and manage a space station in the outer reaches of the Milky Way.

You have been given a small bit of space of your own, a handful of credits and a beat up old WorkerBot(tm). Your task is to take this undeveloped piece of vacuum and turn it into a tourist center/economic hub/mega-prison/diplomatic epicenter or any combination you can manage.

The challenges will be many, oxygen will escape through every tiny hole in the hull, you'll contend with asteroid showers and nebulous alien blobs. In the end though the hardest hing will be managing the various needs and wants of your various squishy alien customers.
