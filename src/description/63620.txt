							You're an Osmo, a strange creature indeed. You explore the galaxy in your spaceship, and the planets you encounter are almost as bizarre as the Osmos themselves. There are seven worlds presented for your consideration, each more goofy and peculiar than the last. Cosmic Osmo is a game about exploration and discovery, not winning or challenges.

												Children and adults will both find something to enjoy in this early gem from the creators of Myst.
