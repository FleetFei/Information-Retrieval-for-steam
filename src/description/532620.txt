							When it’s all said and done, there will be more than 100 Heroes and Hero Variants in Sentinels of the Multiverse. Greater Than Games has created alternate versions of all of them with brand new shiny foil artwork!

This collector’s pack will allow you to use the new artwork with animated foil visual effects in your games. In multiplayer, everyone will get to see which card you chose to play with, even if they don’t own the collector’s pack.

As we add new content to the game, the pack will get the new cards added to it for no additional charge.
