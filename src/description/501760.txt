							Hi, my name is Mike and I am 14. I go to school but now I am on holidays.
The company where my parents work has moved to another city, so we had to move as well.
Right from the moment we moved in the new house, I started to hear some strange sounds, and after a few days I began feeling that there was someone else in the house, and when looking out of the window, it seemed that I could see somebody’s figure out there. It was a girl. 
And yesterday she left a present at our door. When I picked it up, she started following me. The next day, our neighbors told me that had been a girl who liked to come to that house and play hide-and-seek with those who lived there.
Today my parents went to Mexico for a week, and I’m gonna have to spend seven days alone in our new house.
