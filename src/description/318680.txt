							Nicolas Flamel gained posthumous fame as an alchemist. According to legend, he is said to have found the philosopher's stone and attained immortality. Today, this is commonly dismissed as a fairy tale. The philologist Remy Chaveau thinks the same until he gets hold of a previously unknown diary. The book documents the search for Flamel’s mysteries in a very cryptic way and it looks like the diary's author was close to solving them just before he died. Henceforth, Remy follows in the footsteps of the diary’s deceased writer and is drawn into a whirlwind of dark secrets and intrigues.
