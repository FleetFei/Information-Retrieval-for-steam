							Slider Quest is an immersive puzzler with over 40 levels designed exclusively for Virtual Reality. Just as you would in real life, use your hands to grab and move objects around the virtual world as you help guide the ball to the basket. Move blocks and panels to create a path for the ball to follow. Pick up that bow and arrow to shoot down swinging pendulums that might be blocking the way. Grab that hammer that can bust trap doors open. Feel the power as you hold the fire sword and swing away. If that is not enough there are five end of world bosses you have to defeat using your wit and cunning to move onto the next part of the game.
