But you must know on what you spent your money. Now you can, with this game. -We recommend this game to those who have read Thomas Baekdal's 'How In-app Purchases Have Destroyed The Industry' and were excited by it. -In this game, you will have to purchase countless transactions just to play. But worry not. The cash in this game is free and virtual, and is provided limitlessly. (NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!)-However, the accumulated cash amount you've spent will be shown in the game screen, and this will bother you a bit.-This game cannot represent all the pay2win tricks that exist in the world. Even now, new tricks are being conjured.-This game simulates an MMORPG, but only supports single play mode. NPCs who pose as other players appear in this game.-The 'Avatar' you meet in the game is an extension of the game's creator. Talk to him. He is dead serious.Best Gaem Studio "We create gaem"
