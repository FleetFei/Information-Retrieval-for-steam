							We wanted to do something special for the game and so designed a DLC pack were all our profits are going direct to our favourite Charity, Caudwell Children. 

Yes seriously, we aren’t making a penny from this DLC Pack. 

In the pack you will unlock an exclusive branded ship – the Orion, 15 new levels including 2 extra challenge levels, licensed music from artists Chase and Status, Kove, Modestep and Nero and the knowledge that downloading this pack will go towards helping children who need support.

Amur needs a guinea pig, the Outer Reach Council have finally agreed to subscribe to Dakur’s network and someone has been selected to test out all the highway’s to make sure they are working and of course safe. That someone just happens to be Vince and Dakur’s new ship, the Orion, has been sent to pick him up. Are you ready for a new challenge?
