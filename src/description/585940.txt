							Welcome to Project ShieldProject Shield is a simulator that allows you to step right into the shoes of a person who is in danger. Who wouldn't want to do that? In Project Shield you will be able to test your endurance to see how long you can survive. Currently the only simulation in the alpha is the abandoned classroom. In that simulation you will do everything you can to stay alive as long as you can. Given just a book to protect yourself you are under constant fire being shot at from 4 places by pencil sharpeners that were rigged to shoot sharp deadly pencils at you. Do you have what it takes to beat your friends in this simulation that will test not only your endurance but your reaction time and ninja skills?Game Features-Local Multi-Player: With a bowling group name type system.
