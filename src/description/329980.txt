							SummaryASA: A Space Adventure was originally created with love by a single person, and now comes back in a HD remake thanks to the help of developer Andrea Rinaldi. ASA is a first-person slideshow adventure game (point & click) reminiscent of famous games such as the Myst and Rhem series. Visit a vast spaceship called The Ark, divided into several areas, and discover the truth behind the Cubes and their creators... You'll probably need a pen and a paper to write down your notes in order to solve the challenging puzzles! This game can be very difficult for people who are not familiar with the genre. In 2057, an astronaut finds a strange Black Cube in Space, and is teleported onto a mysterious spaceship called the Ark. You soon discover that he's not the first astronaut from planet Terra to arrive here: Philip Forte lived through the very same experience in 2011 and, fortunately, left a diary explaining his story. With this help, you visit the Ark, with one single goal in mind: getting back home!ASA: Remastered Edition is an improved version of the game originally released in January 2013 by Simon Mesnard.
