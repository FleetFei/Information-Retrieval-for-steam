							It's not about the destination, it's about the journey. You journey is to your death, preferably by high-powered plasma torpedo volleys, if the armada of aliens known as 'the nomads' are to be believed. The nomads have no homeworld, they don't believe it's time to 'settle down' as a species. They are still looking to find the right planet, and killing time (and aliens) in the meantime. It's nothing personal you understand, it's just the way the nomads entertain themselves. Galactic genocide is their sport of choice.
						The Nomads is the latest expansion pack for Gratuitous Space Battles. The Nomads are the oldest race in the known universe. They are just travelling from A to B, (although nobody now remembers where A was, or what they are heading to B for), and looking for a little 'exploding aliens' sport on their journey. The nomads are travelling through your part of space, and your homeworlds destruction is this weekâ€™s entertainment for them.
