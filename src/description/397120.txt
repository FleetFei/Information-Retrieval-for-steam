							This set includes:Unique fighter ‘Loki’;‘Mercenary Contract’ — 15 days of premium subscription. Unconventional project of the Imperial design bureau. It combines all the possible advantages of imperial firepower as well as extra speed. And if we add the survival of the diffusion shield, the ship's turning into a formidable weapon of the Empire.The first models of this ship have been transferred to the Imperial Guard. Guards tested it in local skirmishes with Jericho and were very pleased. Many guards use exactly this vessel as their main ship.General: Premium license gives all pilots greater rewards for the battle. In addition, pilots get more loyalty vouchers for contracts! Pilots receiving premium licences from the command master new ships faster due to increased rates of synergy in battle. And when the battle ends, pilots with a premium license have two trophy search attempts —​- which means that the chance of getting new, unique equipment is higher!When buying multiple DLC, bonuses to credits, synergy and loyalty gain are stacked. Together, they provide an even greater bonus! At the same time, premium time also stacks as does the sum of Galactic Standards!
