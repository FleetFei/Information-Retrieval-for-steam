Beyond that pen and paper, whiteboards or digital equivalents can help but are limited to flat surfaces.

Nodes and connections are represented as shapes and lines which can be made, moved and removed to create a map of connected data.Grab things and move them around, attach names or pictures, connect them together and change your perspective.
