The frame and engine are in plain view on the CB1000R ABS, with minimalist lines, and which is a naked in certain respects but a streetfighter in others. Power output is 125 hp at 10,000 rpm.
There is an impeccable clutch and gearbox, as per Honda tradition. If you like motorbikes with everything visible and lots of character, the CB1000R ABS will suit you down to the ground.
The fact that the F4 Mamba bears the name of probably the most venomous snake in the world comes as no surprise. This version has an increased power of up to 166 hp. Hand-built with special carbon fibre, magnesium and carboceramic pieces, it weighs 20 kg less than the original and goes faster than 300 km/h.
