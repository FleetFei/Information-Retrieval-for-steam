							Please Note: In it's current state the game is a sandbox experience taking place on a portion of the larger map we will expand into. There aren't any specific objectives per say other than to disable a security droid(which is on top the mountain), find water and stay alive so you're free to explore. It's pretty bare bones right now but there is still a lot of fun to be had exploring and interacting with the AI. We'll be adding objectives/missions and story line elements in the future. See the roadmap below for more planned features.A comet is hurtling toward earth! Sneak, scavenge and blast your way through an immersive prehistoric world filled with Humans, Dinosaurs, Droids and Mother Natureâ€™s fury!After traveling back in time 70 million years and crash landing you'll need to try to return to your own time before disaster strikes. Fortunately, a lot of spaceship debris is littered about with weapons, gear and items to assist you along the way to ease the difficulties of the journey. As you progress you'll begin to unravel the circumstances that brought you there. However, you are up against your shipmates who will also be struggling to survive and make it home before the impending apocalypse arrives.And of course, various dinosaur species will be roaming the landscape looking for their last meal, will it be you?Key Features in Current Release:Unscripted AI to AI InteractionsEnvironmental hazards like Earthquakes, small Comet Impacts, Lava FlowsImmersive Open World Prehistoric LandscapeBasic Survival ElementsDismemberment & Death AnimationsExplorable Caves24 Hour Time of Day with Multiple DaysDinosaurs in this first release include:UtahraptorTRexCeratosaurusStegosaurusBrachiosaurusDevelopment Roadmap:This list is to provide a general idea of things we are working towards.
