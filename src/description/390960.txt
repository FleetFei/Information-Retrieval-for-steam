							Play as Sol in an impossible journey against the blackness that devours and corrupts the children of the heavens. The stars are falling and a consuming darkness encroaches. Customize your skills, passives, and attempt to defeat droves of enemies that come from the void. Will Sol be able to illuminate his path to victory?


The Demo is not currently a sample of Early Access but rather the Alpha Build, intended to give you a taste of the game's pacing, mood, and difficulty.
