							Third Eye Crime is a stealth puzzle game featuring Rothko, a smooth-talking criminal who can telepathically predict where enemies will move to attempt to thwart his heists. Players must rely on skill and their “third eye” to deftly make an escape. Third Eye Crime was created by AAA-turned-indie developers Moonshot Games, harnessing years of design expertise at Bungie on successful titles in the Halo series to create a fully independent, cinematic experience.
