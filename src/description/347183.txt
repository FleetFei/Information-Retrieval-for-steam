							Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes of the U.S. Marine Corps has fought and bled for his country. But it was his friendship to Tony Stark that opened Rhodey up to the most difficult battles of his life. Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man, was feeling less than invincible when a dark time continually interfered with his superheroics. Donning the Iron Man suit while Tony got his life back together, Rhodey demonstrated an aptitude for Stark-built armor that would eventually inspire Tony to launch the lieutenant colonelâ€™s career as the one man army: War Machine!Items Included in this Pack:War Machine in default Initiative CostumeWar Machine Hero S.T.A.S.H.
