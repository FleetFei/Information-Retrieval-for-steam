							In some platformers you die a lot. Not because you are being killed by things you could not possibly know - you perfectly know what's what but you still can't pull off the moves. In some platformers you spend 10 minutes on a level that can be passed in under 15 seconds. 
You might look at SLIDE's  footage and think that it's an easy game. But you would be wrong.

SLIDE is a hardcore 2d platformer where you run, jump and (often) die. No enemies, no blowing stuff up.

What makes this game stand out - for better or worse - is a system of contextual jumps which allows to perform dozens of jumps simply by combining direction keys with the "jump". You can even jump down.

This feature not only makes for a unique paltforming experience but also adds a puzzle element where you need to figure out what jumps are available to you and which ones to perform in certain situations.
