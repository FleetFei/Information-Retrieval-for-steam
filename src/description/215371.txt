							I got a call from New York. Lucky Luciano wanted my help in getting The Kid on his side. Piece of cake, he said. I wanted Luciano's connections in the Big Apple, so I agreed. What I didn't know was that The Kid didn't want to be on Luciano's side. That was how the trouble started. Piece of cake? I never did like cake.Henry McCarty had the unremarkable childhood of a typical Texas farm boy. Henry was a hot-shot and a rascal and not so much fond of his father. When the old man lost the McCarty ranch to the bank, the young Henry finally rebelled and took off to seek his own fate.In the next ten years Henry changed a handful of jobs. By the start of the War McCarty already had problems with local criminals and decided to abandon the state of Texas. Packing his arrogant temper, his disdainful attitude towards the spoiled city-boys and a pair of trusty revolvers, he headed to New York City. Fate finally smiled on him and he joined the gang of Lucky Luciano, becoming one of his most dangerous and resourceful men.Key Features:New Henchman: Henry "The Kid" McCartyNew Weapon: Golden TwinsNew District: The SuburbsNOTE: This DLC is available after successfully completing the first two missions of the single player campaign.
