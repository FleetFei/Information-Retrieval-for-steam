							This is the POLYCRUSHER soundtrack and Pascal Moschina is the world traveling humanoid composer of that very score. In the process of creating this musical polytimbre, the polygonal dimension, where the Polynauts dwell, engulfed his being and transformed his physis into a topology of entwined spacevectors, forming a mango-pascalese polygonal entity. Listen to it and the fog will clear.Tracklist:1 - Crush'em All2 - Distorted Reality3 - Time To Kill4 - Arcadekaze5 - Herds of Nerds6 - Blood7 - Angstflucht8 - Dumb Bit Terror9 - Overdose
