							The TerraTech R&D Pack is not a normal DLC. Itâ€™s an extra-access pack for those who want to get more involved with the development process by testing experimental, unfinished content. The pack includes: Preview access to experimental new parts, features and game modes, before they come to the main gameA test-lab themed environment allowing unlimited building with new and existing contentAccess to a private discussion forum with the developersThe R&D Pack is not essential to enjoy TerraTech, as all the experimental features and content will ultimately be released in the main game in some form. We only recommend this for players who want to see the latest stuff we're working on and get deeper access to the development process, while supporting the team.
