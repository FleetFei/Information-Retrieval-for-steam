							Welcome to Manyland, an open universe we invent and live together! In an infinite world of abundance, we create new things by drawing them, build new places, hang out and chat, collect, make music, party, script objects, go on adventures... and have fun together in ways none of us can predict."WONDERFUL ... so fun to explore, build, interact, and create ART. Such a variety of things in this world to do" -Joshua C."Exploring the world is a blast" -Massively"The most exciting game I've played so far mainly because of its freedom to shape your world." -Cosmin"i love this game!!" -Carie CormanDraw, build, make music, party, go swim, script interacting objects and adventures, do sports, come up with puzzles, play, explore... Manyland is an open universe with no predefined story, theme or goal... it becomes what we will make of it!Every pixel you see in Manyland is created by all of us together as community. We're two indie developers and this is our labor of love. Our top priority always is all of your happiness! We'll refuse to go compromised "pay to win" routes... let us show the world we can have a universe that's both sustainable, and makes all of us proud! Over 100 million blocks have been placed by all of us already, but we're waiting for one more person: you.
