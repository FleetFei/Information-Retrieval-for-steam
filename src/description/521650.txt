
							About This Game
							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. 
In this second round of releases we offer "Aoki Okami to Shiroki Mejika: Genghis Khan" the second release in the series and the first to be released outside of Japan (under the name Genghis Khan). 
The game includes 2 scenarios. In the Mongol scenario, players become Temujin (the young Genghis Khan) and work to take over the Mongol hordes. In the World scenario, players become Genghis Khan, Lord of the Mongols, and strive to strengthen Eurasia while taking over the rest of the world.
