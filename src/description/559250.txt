The simplicity/complexity ratio is just right – you don’t try to get too fancy but there are also enough elements that can be mixed and matched that the game stays fresh.”“Lovely design and tons of content, it feels like a love letter to PopCap, and that’s meant in the most complimentary ways.”“I really like the art for this game. I’m a big fan of the classic Universal monster aesthetic, and the game has a lot of fun with these different types of creatures.”
