
							About This Game
							Technoball is a spin on an old classic! 

Technoball allows players to place their own music within the game, which is then used to adapt the arena through a dynamic audio visualiser. The game will package with a small amount of music, but the aim is for players to have their own soundtrack and play to the music they love! 

Your paddle's momentum has a direct effect on the ball. The faster you move, the faster the ball will get. Keep rallying to get the ball to insane speeds! 

Designed for 1-4 players using local play, pick from one of five game modes and maps. 

Get the ball past your opponent to score a point, first to 11 points wins in normal mode, first to 21 in Chaos!
