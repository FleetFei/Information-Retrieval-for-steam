							RealityCapture (a.k.a. RC)  is the world's fastest and the most accurate software for creating 3D content from photos and/or laser scans for virtual reality, games, for creating 3D maps or for surveyors. Take your digital camera or phone, it does not have to be expensive professional camera, take some pictures and create 3D content in just few minutes. RC is easy to use with intuitive UI and online tutorials. Everybody can scan, it is great fun! Export your scene to Destinations from Valve and share your 3D content with your friends in virtual reality.What Is Inside? Automatic 3D model creation from your photographs (or laser scans) Automatic alignment/registration/calibration of images and laser scans Advanced coloring and texturing algorithms 3D model export into standard formats (fbx, obj, ply, xyz) A set of tools for analyzing alignment quality and accuracy, mesh reconstruction, 3D model post-processing (filtration, simplification, smoothing), etc.  No limits on model size! Models of unlimited size and detail. Even billions of triangles on a computer with 16GB memory And much moreâ€¦The major competitive excellence: if you double inputs, the processing time will be doubled as well, but any other software will usually increase it fourfold.Version properties Free updates/upgrades Floating online license Max 2500 images/scans per projectDemo version limitations Export restrictions Scenes created in RealityCapture demo cannot be loaded in paid instances of RealityCapture
