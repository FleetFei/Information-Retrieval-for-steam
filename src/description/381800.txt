His father, Martin Webb single handedly developed the commercial console release of Outrun on the Commodore 64 in the 80's. Following in his fathers footsteps almost 30 years later, Thomas has taken his fathers past and used it as inspiration for his first release, DRIFT 84. Martin was on board half way through development, aiding with his extensive experience and adding the addictive 80's coin-op game mechanics.
