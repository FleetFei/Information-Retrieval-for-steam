							Lazarus is a top-down action-oriented sci fi twist on Groundhog Day where thousands of players survive together in a huge persistent real time world, where dogfights, foraging for resources, and exploring exciting new tech combine into a tumultuous 'MMO Roguelike' that turns back in on itself every week like some kind of ultra-futuristic Ouroboros.
