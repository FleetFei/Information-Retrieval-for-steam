							Logic Missile is an action puzzle based platformer where you and the missile must reach the central core. Launch the missile and setup the level properly so that you and the missile can exit the level. This game is extremely hard keep that in mind!

This game was made back in 2012 and is some of my early work. It was uploaded on Steam Greenlight in hopes of putting it on Steam. After almost 4 years, the game has finally been approved and today you get to play the game! The game includes 25 levels. This is an early access.
