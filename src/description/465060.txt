Choose between multiple ships and specialize in each one’s weapon system. Will you focus on good old shooting, virtuously patient shot charging, or dangerous but powerful close-range attacks? In EXZEAL, it’s your choice.Features:4+ different weapon systems to choose fromTwo-player local cooperative playReplay supportMemorable soundtrack spanning multiple genres of musicIncludes Steam Achievements, Leaderboards, and Cloud saves
