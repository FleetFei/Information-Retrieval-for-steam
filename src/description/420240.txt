							The original Monster RPG game. This game was originally released for free in 2007. It's a turn-based JRPG like the sequel. Warning: very grindy, but for the sake of completing the series, and due to request, it has been released as free DLC. Playing this game is not required to play Monster RPG 2 (the stories are not connected.)

The story sees Coro searching for his son Eny who has gone missing. You must battle your way through the mountains to uncover clues. Monsters are afoot, so it won't be easy.
