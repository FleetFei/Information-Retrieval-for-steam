							Patterna is a logic puzzle game for people who think that HexCells is far too easy. It features a highly customizable random level generator, a level editor, more than 70 levels, and an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell.In Patterna, each level is a network of nodes (also known as a graph). In a way similar to HexCells or Minesweeper, each node is ultimately in one of two states (known as pattern and non-pattern). Initially, most nodes' states are unknown. It is the player's task to correctly classify these unrevealed nodes using information based on distance, connectivity, and color. Correctly classifying a node may reveal more information that in turn helps you to solve the level. More than 70 levels, plus a tutorial Procedurally generated levels with plenty of options for the level generator Enchanting minimalist original soundtrack by Alex Cottrell Absolutely no guessing needed Level editor and Steam Workshop support included Extensive gameplay statistics
