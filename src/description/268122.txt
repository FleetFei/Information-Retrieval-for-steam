							BeatWeaverThe BeatWeaver is a rhythm design tool. Based on your choices, it generates rhythmic patterns you can play with. It’s made up of three parts The BeatForm Circuits, Step Sequencer and the BeatWeave list.The BeatForm Circuits send BeatForms – or “note clusters” – to specific locations in a bar through up to 3 preset paths. To see where these paths lead, just follow the highlighted path.A simple 8-step sequencer opens the paths from the BeatForm Circuits to the BeatWeave List. Click any of the steps to activate them.The BeatWeave List shows every possible combination of your chosen note clusters in one bar. Each one of these patterns can be inserted into the Arranger.MapsWhy have 256 unique rhythm patterns organized in a badass map-wheel-gizmo-thing you can interact with to make beats? Well, why not have 256 unique rhythm patterns organized in a badass map-wheel-gizmo-thing you can interact with to make beats?With the BarForm and BeatForm Maps, you have every possible combination of rhythmic patterns in one 4/4 bar neatly organized and grouped together.Take these musical examples: You make house music and want a steady Kick pattern. Why not just get that in one click? You want your chorus section to feature hi hats on the off-beats, just one click. You want some driving double-bass in your metal tune, one click.The idea is simple: all these patterns exist in your music, you just haven’t used them yet. But when you want to, they’re always only one click away. What’s more, when you’ve created a beat, the Maps help to create slight variations very easily- it’s all about how the patterns are organized in the wheel. So take a look around it, you’ll notice that all the patterns are surrounded by similar patterns.
