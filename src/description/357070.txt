							"UBERMOSH is an arcade game about cutting bullets with a sword, in a gun-filled cyberpunk mosh pit."

Like a pinball table or a coin-op arcade machine, UBERMOSH was made to give you a shot of adrenaline in a couple of minutes. Each time you play a new level is generated for you to beat your score in 90 seconds.
