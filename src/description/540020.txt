Have you got what it takes to confront the Dormai Empire? Your actions will define how the story evolves, multiple paths and choices will result in different endings. If you didn't play Final Quest that's OK. Final Quest II is a standalone game. For the best experience in FQII however, we do recommend playing the first game in the series.http://store.steampowered.com/app/512640/Final Quest II Features:Return to the world of Paylea.
