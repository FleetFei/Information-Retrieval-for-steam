Your characters can be injured, infected, killed in battles or in accident.

For example: someone in your group was captured by bandits, and you must choose between leaving him to die, risking the whole group and getting him out or trying to trade him for some of your supplies. Battles are based on tower defense mechanics. You must defeat waves of zombies or groups of other survivors, usings skills and abilities of your characters, teamwork and defensive structures.
