							GN Wagon Pack

The Great Northern Railway operated between Washington and Minnesota, running along part of the old Transcontinental route. In 1970, the GN name disappeared from the rails as it was folded into the merger which formed Burlington Northern, itself now part of the BNSF Railroad. 
The GN Wagon Pack includes the following rail vehicles in GN livery:
GN Boxcar 40-foot
GN Caboose
GN Gondola
GN Hopper 55-ton
GN Hopper 70-ton
GN Ore Hopper
