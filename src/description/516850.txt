							Country music legend, Roy Taggert has had the time of his life until he finds himself on his deathbed and in need of redemption from his illegitimate son, JONAH ANDERSON, 20’s, who he continually denied. Jonah is an only child and he is a talented and aspiring musician who has been raised by his mom, JUDY, 40’s. Judy raised her son with a humble pride that didn’t allow herself or Jonah to pursue the country music legend. PETER, 40’s, is Judy’s best friend and Jonah’s boss and mentor. Upon finding out who his father is, Jonah leans on his longtime girlfriend, ASHLEY PHILLIPS, 20’s, for encouragement after Roy denies him. Enter Roy’s longtime music manager, JOHN BENNETT, 50’s, owner of ‘Virtuous Records’, who attempts to find a way to connect the two talented men by way of his music label partner’s, BECK TIPTON, 40’s, husband, DALE TIPTON, 50’s. Dale is the CEO of the hot television show, ‘The Price’. Three aspiring musicians compete on the show for a deal with the country music record label. After winning and signing with Virtuous Records, Jonah realizes John’s intentions are to reconcile him with his father. Jonah walks away from the opportunity and from music in order to stand his ground and keep his pride. Meanwhile Roy has found himself wanting to make things as right as he can before he dies. He calls out to Jonah through a Baptist Preacher, CHARLES EVANS, 60’s, in order to plead with Jonah to come over to the dying man’s house so that he can offer his apologies for a life missed with his only son. The story closes with forgiveness, redemption, and love as Jonah learns the underlying hero his father Roy and music producer, John.
