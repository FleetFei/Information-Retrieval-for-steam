							The Boeing B-47™ was the first swept-wing multi-engine bomber in service with the USAF. It was truly a quantum leap in aviation history, and is the forerunner of numerous jet aircraft types in service today. As early as 1943, Boeing™ engineers had envisaged a jet bomber, but were unable to overcome issues with the straight wings of the day. However, Boeing aero-engineer George Schairer uncovered some secret wind-tunnel data on swept-wing jet airplanes. He sent the information back to the United States, where engineers then used the Boeing High-Speed Wind Tunnel to develop the XB-47™, which featured swept-back wings. The B-47™ broke a number of records and proved to be a great strategic deterrent during the Cold War era. The B-47E™ is an advanced version of the original XB-47, with much more powerful J-47™ engines. A grand total of 2,032 of these aircraft were built, with the last one rolling out in 1956.Features: One model with three options - with aux. tanks, without aux. tanks and with RATO bottlesHigh-detail reflective bare-metal texture set (.psd source files provided for repainters)RATO bottle pack with unique RATO flight model and custom white smoke effectWater injection thick black smoke effect on take-off (white on RATO model)Many mousable switches in V-C (lights, starters, shutdowns etc.)Highly detailed and authentic 2D panel, xml gauges, fully mousable, with custom pop-ups for AP and radiosPop-up Fuel Panel included, based on real B-47 fuel management panel.
