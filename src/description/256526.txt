Designed by Arthur H Peppercorn, of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). They were the last in a line of famous express passenger steam locomotives for the East Coast Main Line. The original 49 Peppercorn Class A1s were built at Doncaster and Darlington for British Railways at the end of the 1940s. However, the rapid onset of dieselisation in the 1960s meant that all were scrapped, after a life of only 15 years. The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, founded in 1990, built a completely new 'A1' to the original design and with the help of the latest technology. Fitted with additional water capacity and the latest railway safety electronics, Tornado is fully equipped for todayâ€™s main line railway. The Tornado add-on for Train Simulator is a wonderful recreation of this much-loved locomotive and is perfect for creating your ideal steam rail tour.This add-on livery pack presents the locomotive in its original ex-works Grey livery, prior to it being painted in LNER green.You must own the LNER/BR Class A1 'Tornado' Loco Add-on before you will be able to use this add-on
