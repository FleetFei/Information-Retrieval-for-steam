Snowday is a competitive multiplayer VR game built from the ground up for use with motion controllers. A heavy emphasis is placed on tactical snowball fighting strategies. With its fast pace, you'll have to use cover, stealth, and accurate throwing to your advantage. And, if you're good enough, you just might earn your place as the neighborhood's best snowbrawler.
