							Scout DLC opens up the new robot class - Scout. This is the robot, belonging to one of the three races, having invaded the Earth. In contrast to the Soldier, Scout has a wheel instead of legs. It gives him more speed and maneuverability. The main feature of robot type is Energy Shield, his main ability. The right mouse click activates the Shield that absorbs damage dealt to the scout. Shield has its own resources – energy that is a renewable resource. If you do not use the Shield, its energy itself will be resumed.

Scout’s weapons differ from the Soldier’s basic set. For example, Crossbow damages your opponent as well as dazzles him; Discobols cuts the enemy to pieces, its projectiles ricochet off the walls; Mines strike the opponent with shrapnel, rather than explode. Scout is an excellent choice for speed and smart game.
