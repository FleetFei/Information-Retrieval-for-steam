							About This Game:Dead Realm is a creepy, multiplayer action game with beautiful, immersive environments. You can play as either a Ghost or a Human character and work with your friends to run, hide, surviveâ€¦ or die.Development Roadmap:The original concept for Dead Realm was to create a few game types that were simple in nature, while also being addictively fun to play with friends. Our intentions have always been to work with the community to constantly develop new ghost & human characters, new maps, and new game types. This early access release is just the beginning of what we hope to be an ever evolving project. We urge you to get involved and provide input into what types of new content you would like to see implemented.Lastly, we developed this game to not only be fun to play, but also fun to watch. That being said, we encourage you to capture and share your most terrifying gameplay moments.
