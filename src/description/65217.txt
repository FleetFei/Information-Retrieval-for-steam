							The Class 156 DMU, also known as a Super Sprinter, was built from 1987 to 1989 by Metro-Cammell as part of the effort to replace the ageing fleet of first-generation DMUs dating back to the 1950s. The Class 156s were all built as two-car sets, each set comprising a pair of driving motor units. Powered by 6-cylinder diesel engines, Super Sprinters are rated to run at 75mph and are used mainly for suburban and short-haul branch line duties. All units have now passed from British Rail ownership into private hands, and are currently in operation with a number of train operators including Scotrail, Northern Rail, East Midlands Trains, and National Express East Anglia.**Please note that the Class 156 cannot be controlled using the in-game HUD driver interface or Xbox controller.Updated FeaturesProjecting exterior headlights for low light visibilityCab night lighting (activated using Shift + L) QuickDrive CompatibleKey Features:Advance Warning System (AWS) self-test routine.
