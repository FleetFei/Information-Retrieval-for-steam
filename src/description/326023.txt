							The ‘Thunder Box’ is a two-axle coach design first manufactured in Germany in the 1920s for Deutsche Reichsbahn. The type was able to seat from 40 to 66 passengers, depending on which travel class they were configured for. Retirement began in the 1960s, though many Donnerbüchsen remain in use on preserved railway. The Donnerbüchsen Coach pack for Train Simulator recreates the later steel-bodied versions as they appeared in the 1950s under Deutsche Bahn operation.
