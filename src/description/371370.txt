							Havilah and Asharia are at war. It's not the first time and it probably won't be the last. But, what the people of these countries don't know is that these wars have already been foretold. The 4 ancient tablets left behind by the "Creator" prophesy of other things as well but, no one knows what they say. Cyrus and his friends start on a journey to find that out. Their quest for the ancient tablets not only unlocks their hidden abilities but, gives them the knowledge of their continent's demise. What terrors await their continent? Can they prevent a bleak future by knowing what will happen ahead of time or is the will of the "Creator" too strong to be over-ruled?
