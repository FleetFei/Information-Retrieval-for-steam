Unique Korean ship of 15th century, Quee Song is originated from a concept designed by ancient hero of Korea, admiral Yi Sun-sin, who decided to cover ship’s deck with bullet and arrow-proof roofs, making crew almost invulnerable for enemy fire. With combined oars and sails power, it is mostly unrestricted by wind, as primary propulsion power for this small beauty comes from its oars. In terms of firepower, Quee Song really shines – it can fit 17 light cannons, 8 on each board and 1 facing forward, from the mouth of dragon head. What’s special about Quee Song is that you can hire up to 3 different specialists.
