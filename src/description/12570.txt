							Welcome to the world of HotDish, where knowing your way around the kitchen is a recipe for success!
					Build your career one dish at a time as you start at the bottom of the culinary ladder as a line cook in a local Italian restaurant with dreams of one day becoming a world class 5 Star French chef.  Master the timing and accuracy needed to bring simple dishes to the table by executing their various steps and combining ingredients at the right times to create a finished product your customers and the critics will love!  Earn stars for each finished dish and use them to unlock more complicated recipes, kitchen power-ups, and mini-games.  If you can't stand the heat - get out of the kitchen!
					
					Gesture and timing based game play dynamic.
					45 levels of play across 3 locations: a mom-and-pop Italian restaurant, an upscale Asian Fusion restaurant, and a five-star French restaurant.
