							In a future beyond the years of Bruce Wayne's Batman, a new hero must rise to defend Gotham City against threats both new and familiar.  This pack allows the player to control a new Batman - Terry McGinnis - who comes fully-equipped with a technologically-advanced Batsuit allowing him to fly, fire Batarang darts and even turn fully invisible.  Players can also access deadly villains like the radioactive Blight and the return of the Joker himself.
