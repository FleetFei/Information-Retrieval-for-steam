							Support for caffeine deprived devs plus some awesome Thea cards for you!Coffee for coding is an initiative inspired by our faithful fans who have expressed the desire to reward our efforts in delivering the free DLCs and frequent updates.We stand by our decision to make our content free, but we will not say 'no' to some loose change coming our way. After all, more coffee = more coding, right? ;)We also include a gift for all those who wish to say thanks â€“ a full deck of Thea Cards, in the form of high resolution jpgs, featuring our gorgeous character artwork!You can use the cards for role playing games, or just enjoy the drawings. So enjoy and thank you for your continuous support from all of us here at MuHa Games!Note: Once downloaded, you will find the cards in your Thea folder
