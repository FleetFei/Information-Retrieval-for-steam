The story is set in distant future on our planet. Earth is no longer how we know it today. Therefore one of the most important topics of the background story is to find out the truth about those who stand behind it all since the beginning...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BACKGROUND STORY<\/h2><br><strong>The dawn of gods<\/strong><br>Galaxy is a cold and hostile place. Creators know that. They spent billions of years searching for intelligent life and they succeeded. They protect several planets and further developed organisms with advanced technology. Life must not come to an end. Meanwhile, they realize all the risks which await on every civilization such as a destructive genocide. They try to prevent these risks by secretly manipulating and adding information to DNA from foreign forces.<br><br><strong>Rebellious believers<\/strong><br>Creators stand side by side with the human civilization since its initiation. But no one is perfect. Not even gods. Instead of maintaining peace, humans tend to worship war and forget about their gods. And Creators? They realized that their experiment failed. They could not stop fratricidal madness among humans. When the last envoy was killed, nailed to the cross, they returned back where they came from through a portal. To a different planet? To another reality? No one knows. But what we do know is that they keep collecting information through the portal.<br><br><strong>The end of the world<\/strong><br>The next step of the human civilization took nearly 2000 years. During this era a nuclear fission was discovered and whole planet became full of atomic explosions. The war was horrifying and efficient. Everyone who did not hide was hit by radiation and killed. From billions of humans, barely a few hundred thousand were left. This scary message was brought to the creators. They were outraged by the human irresponsibility. They came back and erased the whole human race. \u00a0<br><br><strong>Human 2.0<\/strong><br>The Dead planet kept orbiting in space. During millennia it was slowly getting rid of deadly radiation. The makers decided to begin with a new experiment. With samples of human DNA and surplus of  information they returned life to the planet. They made new humans - Homo Novus. They released them on a newly reconstructed planet and were determined to prevent the same mistakes. Therefore, every clone is now accompanied by a personal robot A2-A.<br><br><strong>DISCOVER WORLDS!<\/strong><br>A2-A is the guardian angel. It helps and protects people and over time gives them more a complex knowledge. It monitors behavior of its ward to prevent increase in aggression, which caused the demise of the previous civilization. Still, this system is not completely reliable. Creators counted on that. They created anomalies on the new planet, so clones can travel in time and learn from mistakes of past civilizations. And who knows? Anomalies might even transfer them into another dimension. Maybe then, people will devote their time to discovery and knowledge, rather than killing and destroying.<br><br>And the Creators? This time they don\u2018t leave the planet, instead they analyze data from thousands of A2-As and wait for the right moment to introduce themselves to their children.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN GAMEPLAY FEATURES OF GHOST VERSION<\/h2><strong>WORLD IS NOT DEAD SCENE<\/strong><br>We wanted to build an authentic world that is not just a one big scene. Almost everything can be interacted with - from surface, bushes, trees to your own structures. There are no flowers that are mere decoration - do you want grab that mushroom and eat it? Go for it!

Characters will get old and die  from injures, diseases or exhaustion. In this case, players will find themselves in the role of A2-A and using DNA will create a new clone with same attributes.
