As the game progresses, mechanics and elements from previous levels are combined into brutally difficult levels that feel incredibly satisfying to master. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou play as a mysterious warrior with a hidden past, using his skills and yours to work your way through a punishing maze of an ancient Chinese village built by unseen hands.

Shortly afterwards, Yi brought SHIO to Coconut Island to create a more polished and fleshed-out version of the game. Since then, the team has been hard at work, making a version of the game with more beautiful graphics, more intricate obstacles, and a more evocative world and story. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur games have received awards from IGF China and the Unity Awards, and we were also among the first Chinese studios to release console titles (Naughty Kitties and One Tap Hero) for the PS Vita and Xbox One.
