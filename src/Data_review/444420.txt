This did not influence my review in any way.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>24 Hours 'til Rescue is a short, but very difficult, action\/RPG hybrid zombie game made with RPG Maker and other resources used in the excellent Apocalypse Hotel.<br><br>The developers mention Apocalypse Hotel on 24 Hours 'til Rescue's Steam game page, so it seems natural to compare the two games. Where Apocalypse Hotel excels in creating a zombie-filled apocalyptic world in which your character can survive and even thrive over the long term, however, 24 Hours 'til Rescue takes the opposite approach: you are a survivor of the outbreak in a race against the clock to escape from the zombies.<br><br>Multiple characters to choose from and two difficulty levels, each selectable either with or without perma-death, provide some replayability, and you'll find yourself hard-pressed even on the easier difficulty level without perma-death getting anywhere near the rescue point.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Graphics - Graphics are similar (seemingly identical in many places) to Apocalypse Hotel, which is a little disappointing. I'd hoped for more variation and a bit of originality. That said, what is here is very well done pixel art, with 10 playable characters, eight of which must be unlocked through play, or some through an optional DLC if you don't want to go through the pain of finding them in game. There's some variation in the player characters, although some of the male characters look decidedly female. (&quot;I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay ...&quot;)<br><br>Sound - Sound is okay, but not fantastic. Most sound effects seem to be taken straight out of Apocalypse Hotel; they're functional, although as with that title they sometimes seem out of place. There's a high-pitched scream when &quot;Someone has died&quot;, which is pretty good, and may be original. The up-tempo soundtrack title song doesn't quite fit the setting, but it's boppy enough that I've found myself humming along or tapping my foot every now and then, and the other songs are good and seem to fit better, but seem familiar; are they from Apocalypse Hotel as well? <br><br>Gameplay - Controls are the same as Apocalypse Hotel and, in a similar vein to that title, are also incorrectly documented on the help \/ pause screen! (In this case, right and left mouse button functions are swapped.) WASD or arrow keys move your chosen character around in a clunky manner that's sometimes unresponsive enough to have you end up facing away from the zombie you're trying to shoot, and mouse buttons attack and kick back approaching zombies. The space bar is used to collect found or dropped items and to interact with world objects, but in a strange departure from Apocalypse Hotel, the developers have made zombie-dropped items disappear after a very short timeout, making it sometimes necessary to do suicide runs into chasing zombie packs if you want to collect the items before they're gone.<br><br>The aim of the game, you're told in a few still screens that make up the introduction, is to reach the military radio-beacon (sic) so that you can be evacuated from the zombie-infested town of Swansea. You only have 24 hours in which to do this, however, so the pace of the game is vastly different from Apocalypse Hotel. You'll find yourself rushing about hoping that you won't run out of your (very scarce) ammunition, and cursing the occasional fast-moving zombie that thwarts your attempts to complete your tasks. Unfortunately all of this is made harder by zombies that respawn whenever you re-enter an already-visited area, or even if you take too long in one area, which seems to reward you for refusing to explore the town.<br><br>Even though the game seems like it will be quite short -- I haven't measured the speed of game time passing, but I'd guess your 24 hours of game time will be up within an hour or so of real time -- it is also very hard, even on the easiest difficulty level. The two main obstacles to overcome that I found were the lack of available resources and crafting locations, and, unfortunately, the clunky controls. The latter, however, was also an issue with Apocalypse Hotel, as I had similar problems with frame rate and movement in that game, too. This seems to be a somewhat common problem with recent versions of RPG Maker on some hardware.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n-------------------------------------PROS &amp; CONS------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Pros:<br>+ It's fun and frantic<br>+ Two characters to choose from at the start, with eight unlockables<br>+ Multiple difficulty levels, including perma-death options if you're into that sort of thing<br>+ Steam achievements to further increase replayability<br>+ Music is pretty good<br><br>Cons:<br>- Problems with framerate and controls on some PCs (likely an engine issue rather than the developers' fault)<br>- Game resources aren't as original as they could be<br>- Frustratingly few useful resources available lead to a game experience affected too much by random loot drops<br>- (Annoyingly short lifetime of dropped loot from killed zombies exacerbates this problem)<br>- Respawning zombies don't work very well with the rushed feeling of the game, especially with the limited resources available<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>I really wanted to like 24 Hours 'til Rescue more than I do. I'm hoping it will still grow on me a bit more as I play, but at the moment it seems a bit like an homage to Apocalypse Hotel that just isn't as much fun.<br><br>That said, the game does have its good points and I've had some fun playing it.

It\u2019s too hard and I don\u2019t think I could complete it even though I\u2019m sure other people could I just prefer sim and pure rpg games instead games where you have a high-score and die so much. It\u2019s like a game called Wazhack which is similar in concept only fantasy not zombie.<br><br>The combat is fun, and the city is scary, especially once its dark and inside where you have to use your torch. If you like games with permanent death amd where you get scared you probably will like this. I do wish non permadeath mode allowed you to keep highscores though \u2013 I\u2019d probably play mare then but I see why they didn\u2019t because it\u2019s designed for more oldskool gamers. If there wasn\u2019t a warning on the front page I wouldn\u2019t have given a positive review but the dev was very careful to say what this game is about beforehand which I think is great because most devs just want to con you into buying their game at any cost. Not that I bought it, I was a Patreon of Flynnfour games back when they had a Patreon so I gert access to all their Betas and games :D even this one which they just collaborated on.<br><br>You can tell that this was not a game made by the Apocalypse Hotel dev and only using her engine because it lacks some of the things I\u2019ve come to love from her games like humorous characters and sim elements. Because this game uses the same engine it\u2019s hard not to make comparisons. Apocalypse Hotel like Star Box or Fortunes Tavern is a story driven game where you can put hundreds of hours into one playthrough \u2013 this game however could be completed in 3 hours although I can\u2019t imagine anyone has yet. The dev told me that she scored 700 points but I cant even get 250 yet.<br>I say good game but not for me and I give 7 out of ten. Would probably give more if it was my type of game!<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21371118', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21371118' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21371118\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21371118' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21371118\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21371118', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21371118_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21371118_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21331314\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043461755\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83196027\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a119c33ac4124f187c3e1eca2df282674fa61da.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a119c33ac4124f187c3e1eca2df282674fa61da.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a119c33ac4124f187c3e1eca2df282674fa61da_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043461755\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83196027\">IRMartinezz<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043461755\/games\/?tab=all\">1,294 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043461755\/recommended\/\">18 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043461755\/recommended\/444420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 Hours \u2018til Rescue is in the same vein of a previous title by the developer, known as Hotel Apocalypse. Whereas the previous game was a little more like a sandbox and story based game, this one seems to be a bit more focused on survival, unlike the previous title.<br><br>24 Hours \u2018til Rescue is created in an engine we all know, but don't necessarily love and that is good old RPG Maker. The issue with games built in this engine tends to be the lack of ingenuity or originality, as a worrying amount of developers assume they can make a quick bit of cash from a second rate RPG. I am thankful to say that this game isn't the case, just like a few others the developer has designed. Instead, they've opted for both their own style in graphics and gameplay.<br><br>Graphically the game makes use of its own art assets, one thing that not all that many RPG Maker games can boast about. Thanks to this it helps the game environment you're currently stuck in bring about a feeling of hopelessness and help develop the surroundings you're in, of which is a city plagued by zombies, set for its own downfall.<br><br>Gameplay, just like the graphics of the game take their own original stance by having a more action-oriented system. You see, gameplay revolves around real time when you're in-game. There will be zombies wandering all around, but they won't be standing around, giving you a chance to choose your attack so you can bosh them over the head. Nope! They're going to go straight for you, and unless you respond in a timely manner, they're going to take a chunk out of your health. <br><br>To retaliate, you must kite the zombies to line up with your character so that you may take an accurate shot at them and knock down some of their own health, although, when there is that many zombies hanging around, it does get a little difficult to get an accurate shot out due to the fact you\u2019re trying not to die! The more action-packed gameplay keeps things interesting and creates a much more stressful situation for the player as a whole.<br><br>The game totes multiple difficulties, some of which are permadeath, whereas others are not. If you want the extra challenge of permadeath then you may, but it isn\u2019t forced upon you, which is a nice addition, even if the game tends to be rather difficult anyway. So, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to spend some time on the easier difficulties to at the very least get your bearings. However, 24 Hours \u2018til Rescue does have an arcade like highscore system, which only takes place on the permadeath difficulties, so be sure to keep that in mind if your score is important to you.<br><br>To keep things fresh for each and every run you go on, you can pick and choose your starting characters, all of which have their own starting items. Every new character will involve a slightly different start to the game, and can even make for a difference in difficulty depending on how well you play with each of those starting items. At the start of the game you only have access to the two, but the further and deeper into the game you get; the more you will proceed to unlock.<br><br>Obviously, you won\u2019t be able to survive the apocalypse with just your typical handgun, even less so if you start to run out of bullets. Thankfully, if you can find your way through the city you might be able to locate a workbench, an area where you can craft both ammo and weapons to use on the undead hordes that fill the streets with their blood and guts. To make these weapons and ammunition you\u2019re going to need to find a fair amount of items, all of which are completely spread out around the city. These parts and items are everywhere and are a little difficult to miss, but when it comes down to it, the main reason you\u2019re going to skip out on some free items is down to the fact there\u2019s an undead shambler beside that wants your guts for garters. <br><br>Throughout your exploration in the game you\u2019ll come across a number of buildings, the majority of which you can just waltz right into. Unfortunately, these buildings tend to be filled to the brim with zombies and there isn\u2019t that many light sources to help you see into the home. Armed with nothing more than a simple flashlight, it makes things a little difficult and tense whenever you enter a new home to scavenge for items.<br><br>Story in the game doesn\u2019t appear to be too big of a focus, but that could just be me only scratching the surface of it all. The gist of the story is this: the apocalypse has broken out, and you want to escape from it. You can hitch a ride on a helicopter, only if you find Patient Zero, retrieve a blood sample, and bring it with you to the extraction point, 24 hours after initial contact. The whole \u201csurvive for 24\u201d hours thing is where the main survival aspect of the game comes in, and is the main gameplay feature of the game. If you can\u2019t survive for that long, then don\u2019t expect to see the end credits; only a game over screen.<br><br>At times the game does have some frame-drops from time to time, and is definitely something that could be done with a fix, but for the most part the game appears to be pretty solid and stable, and I don\u2019t have too much doubt personally that the devs will do something about the framerate in due time.<br><br>Overall, 24 Hours \u2018til Rescue is a fun little survival game with a fair amount of difficulty implemented into it. There\u2019s plenty to do in the game from typical scavenging, or accomplishing quests to help move the story along some more. The original art assets that are rarely seen in RPG Maker games is a nice change and makes the game feel like its own property, rather than another game made in RPG Maker. If you\u2019re at all fans of the previous title by the same developers, Hotel Apocalypse, then it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019ll enjoy this one, too. <br><br>All I can say is just give it a try, regardless of if you have played the dev\u2019s previous title. It\u2019s an inexpensive little survival game that is worth your time and brings something a little new to the RPG Maker scene.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21331314', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21331314' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21331314\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21331314' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21331314\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21331314', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21331314_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21331314_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 29 people (17%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21324983\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198049876976\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"89611248\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a4e137a8dc641f3ed0234cd78fb4384961cae133.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a4e137a8dc641f3ed0234cd78fb4384961cae133.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a4e137a8dc641f3ed0234cd78fb4384961cae133_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198049876976\/\" data-miniprofile=\"89611248\">ExtremeBoyX<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198049876976\/games\/?tab=all\">50 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198049876976\/recommended\/\">18 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198049876976\/recommended\/444420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGood about this game:<br>First you get to kill zombies who doesn't love killing zombies !<br>The bad guys are also AI like the zombies. <br>&quot;I really like this game.
