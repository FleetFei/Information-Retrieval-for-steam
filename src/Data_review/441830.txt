The piano music is simple and effective, the battle system is classic 90s, as is the story; straightforward, simple, compelling, and engaging. The characters are written as classic JRPG characters, with that cheesy, predictable sense that just makes one smile upon reading all of its charm. Fans of Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI and VII, and Ni No Kuni will find something in this game to cheer about. A beautiful return to form. I can only pray that more titles and IP come from this new, growing subsection of Square Enix.<br>The game is refreshing. The art style is beautiful, as well the music. I have beaten the game , but so far the story starts off interesting and is keeping me going. The combat has a classic turn based style to it, my only complaint is that the characters don't always line up in battle to where their stats are on the screen, and sometimes I get a little confused as to which character Im currently at turn with. If you enjoyed ANY nes, snes jrpg, then you are going to want to play this game. And if you haven't played anything that old before, pick this up and see how it's suppose to be done.<br>I am Setsuna is an incredibly strange game. Inevitably you will hear how &quot;classic&quot; it is, in both positive and negative reviews. But in reality it's not very &quot;classic&quot; at all. It is actually VERY experimental in terms of JRPG games. It's very much like Chrono Trigger, if Chrono was much deeper in it's mechanics, and didn't try to make you like it one bit. I am Setsuna is a moody, charisma-less game that took me a few hours to get into, but once i started to understand it, I really, really started to like it. It's like sitting down to talk with a stranger and spending the first 30 minutes thinking how weird the person is only to come to find that they are actually fascinating once you get past the weirdness. Weirdness in the case of IAS being it's quirky acoustic-piano soundtrack, omnipresent snow, tedious menu-system and off-kilter mechanics. What you come to find, though, is a compelling story about duty and purpose, a uniquely melancholy tone and atmosphere, and DEEP RPG mechanics that are fun and rewarding to master. HIGHLY recommended for any real JRPG fan, but understand that this is fruit you have to work to get a taste of.<br><br>Spoiler The ending.<br>Not trying to start drama but I'm really confused, because when I picked &quot;No&quot; Endir didn't kill her, he just stood there and the screen scrolled up and the message &quot;Thank you.&quot; came up as if spoken by the Youth. Then at the end when Endir was walking through the snow at the end Setsuna showed up by the tree. Did other people's endings differ? <br>the ending doesnt change whether you pick yes or no at the very end which makes me think what was the point of even making me choose unless she dies in another way...<br>either way im still pretty sad, it was a bitter sweet ending, the girls who sacrifice themselves become the snow that falls on the land so Setsuna is basically watching over Endir forever.<br><br>ending<br>&quot;Swing your sword?&quot;<br>&gt;Yes<br>&gt;No [X]<br>it does not even matter which you choose setsuna still die in the end.<br><br>Final Verdict <br>4.5\/5<br>I am setsuna is a game changer in this AAA world. The music, nostalgic battle system, and setting is amazing. The environment slows the gamer down and bring you in to a perfect place where emotions run deep. I bought this game to show my Friends that there is more to a game than graphics and shoot em ups. This is a game that faintly taps you on the shoulder when you ask \u201cwhy don't they make games like they used to?\u201d or \u201dWhat happened to the magic in Disney?&quot; For the reviewer that gave the game a 0, its a sad story, ain't supposed to be rainbows and sunshine when you're setsuna._.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30412582', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30412582' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30412582\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30412582' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30412582\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30412582', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30412582_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30412582_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30618235\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AelitaX\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105943372\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/28\/28a5984e183a8a06062b22431513608fe00a778d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/28\/28a5984e183a8a06062b22431513608fe00a778d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/28\/28a5984e183a8a06062b22431513608fe00a778d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AelitaX\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105943372\">\u30a8\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AelitaX\/games\/?tab=all\">265 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AelitaX\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AelitaX\/recommended\/441830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFinished this game in less than 20 hours... so here's my review.<br><br>This game is quite short, as I said, I finished it in just 19 hours even with a little grind and sidequest.<br>Overall graphic is nice in its own way.

It's a simple turn-based battle system that allows you to combine your character attacks to boost damage. The system in 'I am Setsuna' has a few additional quirks - some which work and others that are a little too complicated or random - but that is the basics.<br><br>'I am Setsuna' is a budget title from a new developer (working within Square-Enix) and that sometimes shows. The entire game takes place in snowy environments and while I didn't mind that - it game the game a more intimate feel in my opinion - that won't work for everyone. <br><br>The game is also quite short by the standards of JRPGs. I completed the game in 14 hours - though I haven't done any of the end-game content - and some may be disappointed by that. But as someone in their 30s with less time on my hands I'd prefer a shorter RPG rather than a 50+ hour monstrosity that I never end up finishing. <br><br>The characters in the game are charming and the dialogue is mostly pretty good. The story is simple but effective and the themes are relatable. This isn't a game that descends into incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo towards the end. <br><br>I'd recommend the game wholeheartedly to those that love JRPGs and especially those who grew up on the 16bit \/ 32bit JRPGs from Square. For a first time effort from a new developer this was really promising and I hope they get another opportunity and a bigger budget so we can really see what they are capable of.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30385525', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30385525' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30385525\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30385525' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30385525\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30385525', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30385525_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30385525_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30560368\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ZergCerebrate\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"73980691\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0b4be0373feca9fb77e265dbf20e1f7f595def0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0b4be0373feca9fb77e265dbf20e1f7f595def0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0b4be0373feca9fb77e265dbf20e1f7f595def0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ZergCerebrate\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73980691\">ZCerebrate<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ZergCerebrate\/games\/?tab=all\">391 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ZergCerebrate\/recommended\/\">84 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ZergCerebrate\/recommended\/441830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI recommend this game only to people of a very niche market who like playing oldschool RPG games - this is not a good entry game to the genre as it lacks much of the charm of it's predecessors that it attempts to emulate.<br><br>I have mixed feeling about the game since I'm a fan of the genre and this is a very solid nostalgia trip that doesn't have any glaring bugs that made it unplayable or hang progression.  <br><br>It's a fairly straightforward 20~30 hour oldschool-esque jRPG game with clear homages to Chrono Trigger and a few other SNES jRPGs.  Let's start with the good, it has a fairly interesting combination skill system of item hunting, selling materials to unlock abilities to then equip into &quot;materia&quot; slots that are given per level but also attached to some more powerful talismans (bangles).  You then go about upgrading these skills through use in battle for slight bonuses or star levels and combine them with other allies' techs for Double or Triple techs.  It was fun experimenting and finding a slew of different abilities to prepare for boss battles and deal with specific mechanics.<br><br>The combat unfortunately is poorly balanced, hinging almost entirely onto either extreme ease of instantly clearing the entire screen with powerful AoEs to receive the best materials for even more skills - to the extremely quick party wipe from a boss monster that acts unexpectedly.  It's encouraged not to &quot;grind&quot; in this game as it's entirely possible to clear it without over leveling but making sure to collect material for appropriate abilities to trivialize even the hardest of boss encounters (Which sadly is a small handful at that).  If you insist on grinding experience - you can easily find a few high enemy count areas or a few of the &quot;Special recolored&quot; beasts to farm for a quick boost if you want some padding.<br><br>The dialogue is cliche and the overall overworld, scenes and dungeons all give a samey reused assets vibe (Lots of snow, lots of blocky dungeons, same houses and NPC models).  The story just seems pieced together and the illusion of choice in dialogue in apparent extremely quickly when all choices don't lead to any sort of branching path.  Sadly by some weird design choice - they made the sidequests entirely unavailable until the very end of the game or after you've cleared the final boss at least once.  So the &quot;linear hallway&quot; complaint can be seen here even further as many players will miss the sidequests completely even if they return to exploring because a lack of any hints (I randomly wandered back to every town and wasted a few hours searching for quests before figuring out I had to have the appropriate party leader to talk to a particular NPC each time to start a sidequest).<br><br>The piano music while beautiful at first, quickly becomes a not so memorable grouping of sad piano pieces which only feels tedious rather than creating a somber tone.  The only upbeat piano piece was actually distinct for this reason and wins some points in this category.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30560368', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30560368' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30560368\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30560368' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30560368\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30560368', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30560368_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30560368_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30678356\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Tillburg\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"40914493\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/169c3763e8f903ac22e2b57dbd933c3f9c1b6ac0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/169c3763e8f903ac22e2b57dbd933c3f9c1b6ac0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/169c3763e8f903ac22e2b57dbd933c3f9c1b6ac0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Tillburg\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40914493\">Tillburg<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Tillburg\/games\/?tab=all\">755 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Tillburg\/recommended\/\">97 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Tillburg\/recommended\/441830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGLANCE RECOMMENDATION: <u><b>65% YES<\/b><\/u> \/ 35% NO<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">GOOD<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Beautiful art work and characters.<br><\/li><li>Weapon models actually depict the weapon you equip. I'm always a sucker for an RPG that actually shows my upgraded weapons or armor as I journey. I also appreciate that your weapon includes the defense stats, simplifying your purchases.<br><\/li><li>Spritenite system is interesting. Basically a skill equip system that absorb powerup attributes of your accessories over time. There's a lot you could do with this if you cared to.<br><\/li><li>Enemies are varied and have great designs.<br><\/li><li>The momentum system makes battles interesting and makes you think whether to save up for stronger attacks or if you can even afford to.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">NEUTRAL<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It's incredibly easy to get through almost all of the random encounters. If you take the enemy by surprise, everyone gets a free pip of momentum. I had two people who had physical AoE attacks that just demolished encounters if both of them had momentum, which is easy given the surprise mechanic. There were entire dungeons I never even saw a monster attack and I'm talking about two party members doing this of the first four you meet.<br><\/li><li>Unfortunately the story and characters are as interesting as the majority of the environments. It's a very basic story of using sacrifices to tide the monsters and acquiring party members as you visit new towns. The designs are nice but I can't say there is anything unique about the story or any of the characters.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">BAD<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>There are souped up versions of some monsters called spritenite eaten monsters that are sometimes difficult to discern from the regular types based on what you're fighting and the angle they're facing. Many times I've run into some only to be horrified at how little I did. Luckily you can use an item to escape from these battles, but if you accidentally run into one with no escape item you're probably screwed.<br><\/li><li>No maps for anything. Sure I can understand no maps for dungeons, which still sucks, but no maps for towns or the world map? Especially when most of the zones are either snow covered mountains or a village blanketed in snowfall?<br><\/li><li>Status effects are largely confined to slight visual cues or you having to hit start every now and then to see what's on your character. This gets tedious for the bigger fights where you need to ensure certain statuses are on you or the boss.<br><\/li><li>Lots of skills and spells have qualifiers for AoEs around the target of the spell, but no indicators of who will be affected when cast. This leads to a lot of guesswork in who will get what abilities and, in my case, finding some skills to never have an AoE effect despite saying they do.<br><\/li><li>Food is powerful and lasts for one fight only. It's nice and handy, but finding recipes is a nightmare. NPCs will never tell you they have a recipe, but if you have the ingredients for the recipe they have then they'll just give it to you. This means you just have to find food items and comb back over all previous NPCs if you care enough. Luckily I returned to a few towns as I adventured and prayed and got lucky, but this translated into 3 recipes the entire game despite never selling food and constantly picking it up.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">SUMMARY<\/div>I am Setsuana has a laundry list of annoyances and is unfortunately bland on the story front for an RPG, but the character design and serviceable combat mean this is a fine title to pick up for its budget cost.

I had very minor issues with anything; there were some missed opportunities for very touching moments, I thought, but all in all it really was just an enjoyable, easy-to-get-through gaming experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30661785', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30661785' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30661785\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30661785' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30661785\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30661785', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30661785_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30661785_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30722168\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031236824\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"70971096\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72c4f7499b88cdc058a5fd48001400ea413a70c3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72c4f7499b88cdc058a5fd48001400ea413a70c3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72c4f7499b88cdc058a5fd48001400ea413a70c3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031236824\/\" data-miniprofile=\"70971096\">SlovenlyGiraffe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031236824\/games\/?tab=all\">253 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031236824\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031236824\/recommended\/441830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you like Final Fantasy I through VI and IX?

many of the towns and landscapes are covered in ice and hand-painted, which makes this game appear unique and gorgeous throughout the game\u2019s voyage. There is so much detail you can see your party\u2019s footprints and trail remain in the snow and even watch snow fall from the tree. Character models though unique, look reminiscent of Final Fantasy IV-esque with normal upper body but stubby legs. I also appreciate the character design in this game; most characters wear appropriate attire for the setting, and the one that doesn\u2019t explains why. However, there are a rough total of 18 different enemy models used in this game\u2019s entirety and the game provides numerous palette swaps for each model. In addition, if you were hoping for a desert level, water level, anything not snow, ruins, or cave level you will be sorely disappointed. The game focuses solely on the theme and setting of winter, sorrow, and snow. Despite the limiting theme of winter, the game does well in blending visuals with its running theme and attempt to create variation in visuals throughout the game.<br><br><u><b>Sound<\/b><\/u><br><br>I hope you like a piano-only tracks, because 70 of the 71 separate tracks used in this game revolves heavily around the piano with the occasional violin. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, it helps the player immerse into this cold frost-bitten world and set the tone that everything is an eternal winter of sorrow and snow. While you most likely can imagine the game getting tiresome due to the game\u2019s focus on piano arrangements, the game\u2019s length is short enough for the piano to not be bothersome. Most songs are pretty enjoyable and you may even find yourself throwing your personal favorites into your music player. The entire score was beautifully composed by Tomoki Miyoshi (also known for Steins Gate orchestral soundtrack), and would recommend at least listening to this game\u2019s full OST.<br><br><u><i>Side-note<\/i><\/u>: The voice-acting is minimal for the main characters, using only the JP voice actors when it is their turn in battle and post-battle screen.<br><br><u><b>Story<\/b><\/u><br><br>The game prides itself on being story driven rather than exploration or adventure. Without giving too much away, the story itself is great and if you\u2019re looking for something heart-touching and sad this is absolutely this game. That being said, the story is almost all darkness in a world of white; the game takes itself <i>very<\/i> seriously providing no side-quests or mini-games to explore the snow covered world or have a \u201ccute\u201d sort of fun on the side within this game. <br><br>Although it takes itself quite seriously, character development is one of the biggest things going for this game... Well, for supporting characters. Many companions have interesting and great back stories that explain their reasoning for helping Setsuna. However, the main protagonists are weak in character development; what you learn about Setsuna and Endir in the beginning is all that is revealed and do not explore much beyond that. Endir is a mysterious and famous mercenary (both of which are never built upon) and what\u2019s left are \u201copen\u201d dialogue between making Endir appear kind or cheeky.<br><br><u><b>Gameplay<\/b><\/u><br><br>The battle system is very solid, in that the controls(at least gamepad wise) and innovations put into the system are well thought out and modernizes\/refines the classic JRPG system, however it can be broken at times. The system is reminiscent of <i>Chrono Trigger<\/i> by utilizing the Active Time Battle(ATB) 2.0. It is unique in that waiting <i>after<\/i> the ATB gauge fills up the Special gauge for a Special point (SP) which will then provide additional effects when attacking. This can heal the party, double the amount of hits, changing an attack to an area of effect, increasing duration, etc. You can also combine techniques\/spells into a more powerful move, but there is no way to tell what each combination move will do without going through the trouble of equipping them, and that can lead to some beautiful\u2026 but completely useless attacks. The benefit of slotting passive ability spiritnite greatly outweighs the use of attack ability spiritnite and can lead to some pretty game-breaking effects in which bosses can be killed in one shot.<br><br>While the battle system is solid it is far from perfect; the haste\/battle speed system can break this game and makes it very hard in knowing what to do next in the short amount of time between attacks. The battle speed only continues to get faster towards end-game to the point that it\u2019s frustrating, simply because enemies are that much faster and can freeze or confuse your party, forcing you to use haste to immunize and counter this. On the other hand, abusing haste with a certain game breaking spiritnite can ensure that any enemy cannot move until death. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the game\u2019s pre-emptive attack system is also very unbalanced; depending on who snuck up on who, the enemy or your party is going to wind up dead making some of the normal enemies tougher than boss fights. <br><br>The game itself is also very linear, many of the dungeons or caves offer very little in branching paths so it feels like you\u2019re just killing enemies in-between cut scenes as you move from point A to B. One thing I enjoyed about this game is that many weapons can end up being end-game worthy simply because of the interesting upgrade system. Upgrading weapons not only determines the attack and magic attack of a character, but also their defensive stats and properties.<br><br><u><i>Side-note<\/i><\/u>: There is no replayability\u2014there is no New Game+ and continuing only picks up at your last save point. In addition, there are no inns, only camping outside via the tent item.<br><br><u><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/u><br><br><i>I am Setsuna<\/i> is a pretty good game, above average overall and can sate your hankering to play a JRPG. The visuals and aesthetic pair extremely well with the music and fits great into the running theme of winter, sorrow, and snow. Though the game takes itself too seriously with little to no side tracking, it still fits into the running theme of the game, that it is a story of sorrow from the moment you click New Game. The story and character story development was great and kept me strung along as the past and background for each companion came to light. Although I wish the battle speed could be adjusted for the battle system, Tokyo RPG Factory does well in providing innovative and unique spins to the classic RPG battle system. Though this game is by no means <b>the<\/b> spiritual successor to <i>Chrono Trigger<\/i>, I have become an absolute avid fan of this game and enjoy all it has to offer despite its faults.<br><br><i> \u300cSetsunai\u300d<\/i> is a word that has no equivalent in English, but it is about something that gives your heart a squeeze; whether it's those feelings of pain and loneliness you get when you are in love, feelings of loss, nostalgia and melancholy, or that feeling you get when you see a beautiful landscape or painting and Tokyo RPG Factory successfully set out to do just that with <i>I am Setsuna<\/i>. I am very interested to see what they do next.<br><br><br>*Disclaimer: I played this on my PS4 when released for JP, to the extent of my knowledge and play on the PC there are little to no changes on the PC port.

Despite some others who found the game lacking, I actually found it rather enjoyable. With that I'll state the pros and cons. <br><br>Pros:<br>+Battle system is similar to Chrono Trigger, which makes it fast pace and exciting<br>+Really beautiful artwork, and the scenery's amazing.<br>+Piano BGM, which is unique.<br>+Lots of customization in terms of skill builds, weapon choices, character\/skill names etc.<br>+Weapon outlook changes as you equip different weapons.<br>+Character interactions are really cute.<br>+Cute monsters and bosses. Picture yourself fighting a chibi penguin and an overstuffed baby seal.<br>+Certain boss fights are rather tough, requiring some character compositions to tide over.<br>+Cutscenes are done wonderfully. <br>+Has a decent replay value.<br><br>Cons:<br>-The game is pretty much just snow everywhere.<br>-Story is too similar to Final Fantasy X and Tales of Symphonia.<br>-Can't skip cutscenes.<br>-Even though there's voice acting, it only occurs during combat. And its only in Japanese Dub.<br>-Many people are facing problems with the XBOX one controller, which tends to screw up the controls. Only way to fix it is to rebind it but there's no way to save it everytime you launch the game.<br>-Alot of indepth info that are actually missing, which tends to make new players confused and lost. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>I actually figured out how to use &quot;Momentum&quot; near to the end of the game. Still have 0 idea how to use Flux.<\/span><\/span><br>-There's absolutely NO map guidance or navigation. You have to sort of memorize the map\/world layout to progress.<br>-Most boss fights are just tank and spank.<br>-Positioning is crucial in battles but you have NO control where your characters stand\/move.<br>-Farming for materials to gain skills\/perks may get repititive afterawhile, especially when the mobs don't drop the key item.<br>-Throughout the game you'll encounter dialogues in which you can make choices, but sadly it has ZERO impact on the game. <br>-Ending felt abit lacking, with tons of questions left unanswered.<br><br>Overall I felt my money was well spent, though some others might disagree. Definitely will recommend people to buy this game when it's on sales.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24452414', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24452414' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24452414\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24452414' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24452414\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24452414', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24452414_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24452414_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30614298\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ultradyong\/recommended\/441830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"48666093\">Yong David<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel up your character by doing the event several time, so that you can loot for better items for yourself and the other players in your game.
