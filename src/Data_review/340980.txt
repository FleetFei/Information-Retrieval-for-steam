I'm not sure what I was expecting, something like Spacecom perhaps.  It's similar in that it takes place in a solar system.  You fight an alien invasion, by building ships and colonizing the solar system, to gather resources but mainly to deny their use to the enemy.  <br><br>The depth of detail is amazing.  And overwhelming.  The user interface is clunky, the buttons are rather small (especially to close the tabs, which you'll be opening a lot of).  <br><br>The space battles are turn based, no complaints there.  It works quite well.  My only complaint is the small font size which makes it difficult to read and select the weapons you want to fire.  The auto resolve feature also plays of the rest of the battle, rather than giving you a quick result.<br><br>Ship design takes a few tries to get the hang of.  You have to balance power production with heat disapation and power consumption.  Some trial and error is all it takes to get a feel for it, and you'll be pumping out overpowered warships with the lifespan of a mayfly in no time.  But if you do, try not to waste your crew in vain.<br><br>Crew have several levels of skill which directly impact the funtioning of the ships.  Each ship requires one (fighters) or more (everything else) officers to function properly.  The Soviet approach might be viable late game, but early on you'll be agonizing over every lost officer.  The crew you'll agonize over only if they're trained and you don't have unlimited pools of them (Poor and Green in my case, poor cannon fodder).<br><br>The diplomatic aspect is like XCOM.  You have to get the various factions of Earth to fund your war with the aliens, and they'll bail on you if you give them reasons to.  They also hand out missions, which hurt you financially if you fail them.  The time frame to accomplish them seems to be adequate, but I would have been screwed if I hadn't been planning a Jovian base already. (The mission was to colonize Jupiter or one of the moons).<br><br>In short, if you like in depth sims with ship design and long term planning, this is for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24587082', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24587082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24587082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24587082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24587082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24587082', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24587082_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24587082_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/340980\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24587082"]}
