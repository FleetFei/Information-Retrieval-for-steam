released way back 1993.<br><br>This is of course nonsense, you know what the spiritual successor to Masters of Orion was?<br>Masters of Orion II published in 1996, in fact is wasn't just a spiritual successor but an actual, real successor to boot.<br><br>There have been plenty of amazing space based 4X titles in the  20+ years following MOO,  Imperium Galactica in 1999, Galactic Civilization in 2003, Distant Worlds 2010 and countless others (most of which have spawned expansions and sequels themselves)  <br><br>So this obsession with MOO is getting a little old, Do we call every new car  design the spiritual successor to the Model T?<br>No, we don't!<br>So on that note, I want to state that Galactic Inheritors is NOT the spiritual successor to MOO!<br><br><br><b>4X Inheritors<\/b><br><br>So what is it?<br>Galactic Inheritors is a 4X space strategy game currently in development and available as an early access title through Steam.<br>If you've played any of the games mentioned above the basic concept should be familiar to you.<br><br>You'll start with one populated system, you'll  need to construct buildings to improve your  infrastructure, build ships to explore new star systems and colonise them, conduct research, practice  diplomacy with other races  and keep a strong military to defend and expand your influence when diplomacy fails.<br><br><br><b>The Same But Different<\/b><br><br>Sounds like we're on familiar ground so far, but there are several differences with Galactic Inheritors  which sets  it apart from the pack.<br><br><br><b>Building Capacity<\/b><br><br>In most 4X titles, if you construct a building it will  increase production of its associated resource.<br>When you construct an industrial building you'd expect your industrial output to increase at its location, not  so  in Galactic Inheritors.<br>Buildings do not increase output of a resource but instead boost the maximum potential output of a solar system.<br>Construct an industrial building here and it will increase your production capacity, not your production.<br>The solar system itself needs to grow to a sufficient level in order for it to gain an advantage from the building.<br>This is a nice idea which eliminates spamming construction of a certain building type in a system which isn't ready to support the increased output.<br><br><br><b>Casus Belli<\/b><br><br>Diplomacy also takes a different tack in Galactic Inheritors.<br>Media and public perception of the situation is just as important as military prowess in most conflicts  and this is something recognised in this title.<br>You can't just start an unpopular war with an inconveniently placed neighbour on a whim.<br>You'll need to manipulate the media first, get your populace on the hate bandwagon and then you're  war will be seen as justified, giving you free reign to start the extermination process.<br><br><br><b>Bug Eyed Monsters Eat Babies<\/b><br><br>Your propaganda machine is all about hate, greed and fear, you'll have a certain amount of points totalled across these three aspects. You can increase these points by adopting a negative stance in your empires media towards the offending alien race. <br>You will then be able to choose appropriately negative news stories to besmirch the filthy aliens and their alien ways.<br><br><br><b>The Right Stuff<\/b><br><br>Whilst your convincing your populace that destroying your alien neighbours would be in their best interests, you'll probably want to consider bolstering your military fleet to ensure you've got the tools to do the job when the time comes.<br><br>Rather than building ships through your solar systems, this is done separately via your military industrial complex.<br>You have access to companies within your empire which will construct the ships you order.<br>As they build the requested ships their experience will increase, allowing them to improve their designs which will, in turn, allow you to buy upgrades in each respective companies upgrade tree.<br><br>In practice this works like a seperate research tree, you'll spend points to unlock improved designs on an upgrade tree. <br>Each company has their own specialities and it's unlikely that you'll be able to unlock all the upgrades for all the companies, so specialising in a certain area is a strategic  decision you might want to make.<br><br><br><b>Weird Science<\/b><br><br>Talking of Research Trees, like most 4x games, you'll find the research tree present and correct here, with branches leading to new and improved buildings and ship designs waiting to be unlocked to give an edge of the enemy.<br><br><br><b>Star Lanes<\/b><br><br>Galactic Inheritors adopts the star lane approach to travel between systems. At present, these lanes all take just one turn for a ship or fleet to traverse regardless of the distance to the destination,  It would be good to see some variation in this, the rush to move fleets to distant hot spots along a lengthy star lane is always fun when you know it's going to take a few turns to arrive.<br><br><br><b>Uncharted<\/b><br><br>Exploration is a two stage process and takes a little getting used to. When a scout ship arrives  at an uncharted system, you need to instruct it to explore that system for a turn before you know what's there and where  the newly discovered star lanes lead off to. <br>This isn't a bad thing, it adds to the realism, but at first, it's an easy thing to forget to do.<br><br>The second stage is scanning for  resources. After you explored the system for a turn you will then be able to search for resources which will take another turn before the information comes in.<br>It's worth noting that  there are no individual planets in the game.<br>At the time of writing, all exploration and colonisation is done at a star system level.<br><br><br><b>The Art of War<\/b><br><br>Combat itself is probably the simplest part of the game at the moment.<br>You move your ships into a system with an enemy fleet and the strongest fleet wins.<br><br>Don't go expecting a flashy cut scene or tactical battle decisions here, this is akin to moving counters on a board. It  can feel a little unsatisfying and for me is the weakest part of the game in its current state.<br>Once you've cleared a path to the offending alien system you'll need to bombard the alien colony to dust, then send you own colony ship to claim the system for yourself.<br>There are no troop or ground combat mechanics here, you don't take over colonies, you destroy them.<br><br><br><b>Skin Deep<\/b><br><br>Galactic Inheritors is not going to win any beauty contests with its current looks.<br>You're going to be spending a lot of time staring at the  tried and tested top down map view scattered with stars that I'm sure we're all familiar with.<br>I appreciate that beauty is only skin deep, especially in 4X titles (I'm a huge Distant Worlds fan and that game is far from good looking) but pretty is always nice and any graphical overhaul during the development process would be more than welcome.<br><br><br><b>Early Access Inheritors<\/b><br><br>There are the inevitable early access issues to be found here, musical glitches and errors in the games text pop up quite frequently, the use of &quot;has&quot; instead of &quot;have&quot; is the most frequent offender,<br>E.G. &quot;I HAS found another text error&quot;.<br>I'm sure these will all be fixed before the games release and they certainly don't detract from the core experience.<br><br><br><b>Galactic Conclusion<\/b><br><br>Niggles aside, this is an early access title with some very interesting new ideas.<br>The core of the game is already in place.<br>The implementation of propaganda and the military industrial complex mechanic are exciting features and add a new dynamic to the experience.<br>Although lacking in polish, the game is...

A 4x Space Game. <\/div>Name: Galactic Inheritors<br>Genre: 4x, Strategy<br>Personal View: All these analogy is making me hungry.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Review <\/div>Let us use food to represent the quality and type of space 4x I have played over the years. Sins of A Solar Empire is like a fast food, I eat it quickly since the game only takes 2-3  hours per match and it doesn't leave a mess on the table with bloated save files and such and quite nicely enough it has a wide variety of plate or maps for me to play with. Endless Space is like a fine dish with a good company although it does overstayed its welcome from time to time. Distant World: Universe is like going into a restaurant and having someone pass me the chefs hat and expect me to cook my own food, then again I have a wide variety of options and so on but to get to the dish takes so much time and effort.<br><br>Galactic Inheritor is an entree that is a soup, which I am eating without a spoon. Lets break it down shall we?<br><br><b> Graphics <\/b><br>Now I don't expect much from the graphic department since this is a 4X game where the gameplay carries it to the goalpost but the complete lack of any animation tickles me, in a bad way. Having at least some flourish is good since the graphics won't look dull so quickly.<br><br><b> Music <\/b><br>Turn it off and replace your own, no dynamic tempo or large range of music samples to be found here, its only a few tracks that plays over and over again.<br><br><b> Gameplay <\/b><br>I can forgive the game graphics and music but the gameplay should be the complete focus which parts of it certainly botched up essential 4x mechanics. Lets go over the pro and con 1 by 1.<br><br>There's 5 races in the game which is a good thing since more races means more time before things too familiar. What is not awesome is the fact that in every game its the same 5 races, meaning you can't set to have 4 scorpion dudes and 1 frogs. You are forever stuck with 5 of each in every game. And the bonuses you get from choosing the races hardly matters anyways due to the game mechanic itself.<br><br>3 galaxy scale which is good but since you can't set your own custom planet amount its frustrating, again especially due to the game mechanic botching things up a bit. 3 standard difficulty level which is standard.<br><br>And lets go through on how the game botch things up. First things first the lack of build queue especially in a 4x game such as this one. Remember the galaxy scale thingy? Here's why it sucks to have so much planet, you have 10 planet and 7 are scheduled to finish their improvement in the next turn but since there is no build queue you have to manually go to every single planet and reassign them a new order. Repeat for every single turn where things happen to finish building. <br><br>My other major gripe is how there is almost zero flavour texts for the buildings we get to build. What exactly does some of the stuff do in the game is never properly explain instead I find myself tend to rush prioritizing buildings that actually have the +2 economic\/technology\/commerce instead of building those obscure things. It doesn't matter anyways since building things doesn't use money <br><br>The other issue is the diplomacy in this game, you have to border an empire before you can even send them a message. And message are called media in this game and take turn to actually have any effect, and trying to declare war requires several messages of &quot;I hate you.&quot; before you can go blast\/nuke their planets off. Combat is a simple matter of who has the biggest and most ships in a fight and is often decided in one turn. You can just insta heal in any friendly planet.<br><br>And if you focus so much on military you actually have a huge advantage when you blew your foes ships to smitherens. You can't build military ships on planet but instead you have to go to the shipyard menu and assign them to build, granted it is a unique idea to have the shipyard level up and become better at making them but when you can only pump out 3 ships every 5 turn and that battle just blew up 6 of them its easy to snowball your way to victory, especially with how siege is done. Every ships without exception can add bombard and each ships in a fleet add to bombardment strength with siege lasting only a few turns, coupled with slow recovery rate and 1 turn colonizing its easy to see how hard it is for the AI to recover once you took a few of their planets. Overloading your shipyard does nothing but slows down research which isn't a problem when you can just take 2-3 planets to compensate for more ships.<br><br>The research screen only has a tiny bar used to scroll and once again the lack of any description text.

It is not as Epic as other space games, but it is fun. Turn based. The game is rather simple on some levels and a little complex on others.<br><br>Moving ships is easy - just select the fleet and right click to your destination.<br><br>You need to Explore a star system before you can colonize it. Enemy star systems that you conquer you can immediately colonize. To find resources you need to explore a second time, and then activate the resource with an explorer ship which uses up the ship. Once activated resources will increase that area of the star system by one resource.<br><br>Battles are hands off. The fleets will 'fight' on the strategic map and you will see the results. There are no graphics for the battles except ship losses.<br><br>Handling Colonies and Fleets is really easy because there is a spread sheet type display for both. Also, there is a message sheet every turn. All of these sheets really help the player to handle the Empire.<br><br>Diplomacy is simple yet a little involved. First, there is only War and Peace. And why not? Many games have trade and alliances but Galactic Inheritors does not. To declare war you first have to convince your population that the enemy empire is evil. You use Media propoganda to do this over time. It is also possible to stall the other empires this way. So you have to prepare for war as it takes time to move the slider from Peace to War.<br><br>Building ships is really neat and novel for this game. You order the ships from one of three military companies that will build them. You can order up to three ships from each company at a time, so a total of nine ships can be building at once. As a company builds ships over time it gains experiance and skill points which can then be spent on improving that company's production. I found this aspect of the game rather neat. (Note: Colony ships and explorers are built at star systems and not by the ship companies.)<br><br>Also, there are Empire bonuses you can earn. Net commerce will add funds to the Empire bonus level each turn. Once a new level is reached you can buy an Empire bonus, such as better manuevering ships for the entire Empire. The amount of funds needed to gain a level is based on how many star systems you have.<br><br>Ordering ships will lower your net commerce amount. It can go negative with no problems accept = no funds will go toward your Empire bonus level. As a matter of fact the Empire bonus level amount will also go negative and can be 'paid off' once you finish building ships.<br><br>Overalll this is a fun game. It is not too in depth and is one of the easier Space 4X games to play. Probably good to pick up on sale. I liked it.<br><br>One negative I had was the music would stop playing after a short while. I liked the in game music. So I played a CD instead but had to lower all sound levels in the game or my own music would not repeat. No big deal really.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18166642', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18166642' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18166642\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18166642' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18166642\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18166642', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18166642_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18166642_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17682808\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"12492438\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2a50e07c167ffb464e9204ebaa1534f43b8ee3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2a50e07c167ffb464e9204ebaa1534f43b8ee3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2a50e07c167ffb464e9204ebaa1534f43b8ee3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/\" data-miniprofile=\"12492438\">Altered_Confusion<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/games\/?tab=all\">328 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/recommended\/\">83 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/recommended\/322540\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTake to the stars as one of five different races as you try to conquer the galaxy. You will be able to do so through diplomacy, conquest, research, and more. Will you be the last race standing or will you pay the ultimate price and see your race wiped from existence.<br><br>Galactic Inheritors is a 4X strategy game by Crispon Games and Argonauts Interactive. The races you will get to choose from all have their advantages and disadvantages, but if you learn how to master them you can definitely put yourself in the lead for how you want to play the game.<br><br>I'm going to be honest with you, I've been putting this review off for a while, and the reason is that there's some much to this game, but for some reason there are parts that just don't translate to me. Here's the deal, if you are going to pick up this game you HAVE TO go through ALL the tutorials, if you do not you will not be able to do almost anything but the very basic stuff in the game and you will see your empire destroyed not too far into the game.<br><br>The amazing thing about this game is that it has a lot of depth and modifiers that can change the game for you or against you, the problem is that for some reason for all of this amazing backbone, the actual gameplay grated on me. I felt like I was playing a intricate board game on the PC that didn't really get much polish. The reason I say this is that the combat in the game, the movement in the game, and just the overall feel is very underwhelming.<br><br>When you move your ship from galaxy to galaxy it just poofs from the start point and then appears at the next point. When you attack, which by the way there's some crazy intense diplomacy that you have to get through before you can do so, the battles are very lackluster. The same goes for when you are attacking a colony, which in a very interesting decision apparently there's only one suitable planet in each galaxy which I personally would have liked a bit of a choice for each. <br><br>Now I mentioned diplomacy, and this is one of the things YOU HAVE TO do the tutorial on, it is not easy, and if you try to just do a trial and error approach you're going to get yourself even further lost, believe me, that's what happened. <br><br>Space exploration is another thing that I still can't understand, so you take a scout ship to a new location, it explores the system and then it reveals that there's a planet and the paths to other systems. The next turn you will have to look at the system again to reveal what the planet has for bonuses. There's also a finite distance you can go with your ships, which I still can't figure out, but I'm sure that it was told in one of the tutorials that I must have missed.<br><br>Speaking of ships, this is both an interesting move and a frustrating one. Outside of scouts and colony ships your race doesn't actually manufacture the ships that you'll be using in the game, thanks to a tutorial I found out that you have to basically out source to one of three vendors to create ships, but in an interesting twist, you have to research the technology to open up more ship options. So the vendors are as advanced as you are. This of course is really odd because other opponents could be contracting them for much bigger and better ships at the same time. Now I will tell you this, once you decide on a vendor stick with them, you gain points that you can then use to customize your ship.<br><br>Alright so in conclusion this game definitely is a unique experience that if you are willing to really dive in and learn through MANY mistakes your going to find a game that is different and stands apart from the rest. For me personally I think that it stands a bit too far away from the rest, and there are definitely quite a few things to the game that just didn't wow me at all. So if you are looking for a different 4X game check this game out, otherwise there's other 4X games out there to enjoy. This game, for me, gets a 6.1 out of 10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17682808', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17682808' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17682808\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17682808' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17682808\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17682808', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17682808_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17682808_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15566170\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012219450\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51953722\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2daf1b11462c0ded2352e5e1e667efcbed10a56.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2daf1b11462c0ded2352e5e1e667efcbed10a56.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2daf1b11462c0ded2352e5e1e667efcbed10a56_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012219450\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51953722\">nosavynada<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012219450\/games\/?tab=all\">199 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012219450\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012219450\/recommended\/322540\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Galactic Inheritors was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 26, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGalactic Inheritors is exactly what the game summary says it is. So if you like that summary and you do not apply your own ideas of what else it might be, implied or otherwise, then this game will suit you and I recommend the game for you.<br>If you are invisioning great dynasties and story side events to occur similar to CK2 or EU then although that may be the inferal you are most likely to take from the dev shop, it is not what they are drawing on for this game and in that you will be dissappointed.  Like CK2 and EU you must work to gain the option \/ ability to declar war.  From that stand point it is a nice turn to space based 4x games.  It also means there are no suprises out there.  No enemy bound, determined and soon to spring upon you without warning.  There is always a lead up and you have some time to prepare.<br>Many will like this aspect I think.<br>The expansion, the tech tree and the ship management are all pretty simple and work for achieving the stated goals of the game description.  There are not bad systems to colonize, only those that will be less good than others.  With no penalty for colonizing even systems with only a 1 of 4 or so starting value in each of 3 catagories (commerce ($), production and research this is reduced to colonize each system as fast as you can with the exception of find your choke points to nearby races quickly and colonize them and thus prevent them from colonizing or moving even further into your space.<br>The most developed and it seems the focus of the game is the media. It is the mechanic most unique to the game and displaces diplomacy.  In this game much like in the minds of many European states today conflict is purely a response driven by the media.  Convince your audience the enemy is bad and preventing you from your greatness and you can get the populace opinion poll to get you enough over to the fear, hate, greed scale of your enemy is bad that you can declare war and war you shall have until it swings enough to the other side that peace may be signed.  This is a war of attrition to an extent.<br>There are many wish to expand, build and reach the end of the tech tree and for whom combat and war are bothersome and when they can come at a moments notice seem unfair.  For those in particular this game I recommend this game.<br>As for those who look for satisfaction in quickly balancing the factors of income, expansion and military might to overwhelm and achieve victory I think you will be less than satisfied.<br>If you are expecting some of the witty, interesting and twists from CK that keep that game well above watching paint, that ingredient is missing.<br><br>I enjoy CK but to be fair it is the dynastics, the awarding of titles, and the pop up events (not necessarily because they are historical) that keep the game from being very dry.  The same applies to EU series though its potential for dry and mechanical even more relies on the events (for me.)  This game is like them in that it is based more on an overlay of a database and mechanics that allow for challenges from the AI as the paths for behavior are more stringent.  A game does not have to have great or even good graphics to be a good and challenging game.  <br><br>I can not in fairness not recommend this game as it does exactly what the description says, not a whole lot more but does it well and there are many who play 4x games who will like this direction.  So I can recommend it for that crowd.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15566170', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15566170' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15566170\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15566170' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15566170\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15566170', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15566170_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15566170_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19111809\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"42764647\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42764647\">The_Cpt_FROGGY<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/games\/?tab=all\">2,072 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/recommended\/\">248 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/recommended\/322540\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGalactic Inheritors:<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>   <br>With all its splendour, the galaxy is full stars, planets with exquisite resources and fives species including my favourite one the \u201cRibetars \u201c(Amphibian, frogs like species. We are everywhere, cousins!) who will go head to head for galactic supremacy in this 4X space game.<br><br>At first, you will have to setup a game by choosing which race you will be playing (rebit..rebit..are), what map size which includes small, medium and large. The smallest map will have 50 solar systems and the largest one 100 planets. Regardless of which difficulty you will choose, I strongly suggest to go through all tutorials. <br><br>Whichever race (each with its different strengths and weaknesses) you choose, you will start with one main solar system and an exploration ship which you will be sending to explore planets and their resources.  As you explore and colonize planets, you get additional research and commerce points. The more points you get, the faster you will learn a new technology (research) and you will be able to buy further ships for your fleets. Also, by adding specific buildings, and as your species grows, research, commerce and production will increase per planet.  As your species progresses, you will be awarded Empire bonuses which is basically an upgrade.<br><br>I really like the game interface; you have the Military industrial tab where you can order your ships and add upgrade to them. It will also show you how large your fleet is as well as the other species. There is a research tab with good descriptions. The message tab tells you what had happened in the previous turn. There are fleet overview and solar system tabs, too. Diplomacy wise, you will have quite a few options and it can be tricky at times. Galactic Inheritors has really good and comprehensive depth. <br><br>One tip, if you decide to go to war with one race, make sure you have a good armada because you will need it!<br><br>Graphics could have been better in my opinion and the audio is turning itself off after a while and you are left with the same sound effect (a ship throttle) through the rest of the game. <br><br>Positives:<br>~~~~~~~  <br><br>-\t5 Species to choose from (rebit..rebit)<br>-\tGood interface with good depth <br>-\tChallenging <br>-\tGood tutorials<br>-\tTrading cards<br><br>Negative:<br>~~~~~~~ <br> <br>-\tGraphics could have been better<br>-\tReally short audio<br><br>Galactic Inheritor has great depth and is really challenging.

They cleaned up the UI a bit and fixed a plethora of bugs and glitches. However, there still just isn't enough here to justify 20 dollars. When I first joined early access with this game, I was expecting something much... more. The 2 things that make this game stand out is the Military Industrial Complex (which is how you build your military ships) and the media-focused Diplomacy system (essentially by using the media, you control how your population views another faction) which again are both really cool features. Everything else is kind of watered down as far as 4X Turn-based strategy games go. I still recommend the game for people unfamiliar with the genre because it's very easy to pick up but for anyone who has played SotS, GalCiv, or Sins, then you've pretty much tread this territory before.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bCRnefNUFDA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bCRnefNUFDA<\/a><br>Early Access Review:<br>&quot;The usual 4X Strategy game. Similar to GalCiv or MOO yet with less personality. However, what it lacks in aesthetic, it makes up for in functionality and straightforwardness. For example, it ignores the technobabble of say... Sword of the Stars and tells you exactly what building something does. The Military Industrial Complex is a cool idea too... but you know what the best part is? Space Frogs.

Sure, it's a slow begining (but like all 4X almost) and the graphical elements have much room for improvement (but if I can tell from the screenies around, it's upcoming)... but the most interesting thing is the key concepts in the game, that are a welcome change for once.<br><br>No need to worry like crazy about war and early aggression (although 'Si vis Pacem, Para Bellum' ) but better build a few warships, and the interesting idea of the private enterprises in the military industrial complex doing that task for you (yes, I am the kind who hates design every single part of spaceships).

There is a jewel here...<br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14424609', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14424609' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14424609\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14424609' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14424609\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14424609', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14424609_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14424609_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17714831\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OrangeCaramello\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"90796250\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73e168b8da813bb14138c93807d84d5ec35a8660.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73e168b8da813bb14138c93807d84d5ec35a8660.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73e168b8da813bb14138c93807d84d5ec35a8660_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OrangeCaramello\/\" data-miniprofile=\"90796250\">Saint Killjoy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OrangeCaramello\/games\/?tab=all\">690 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OrangeCaramello\/recommended\/\">116 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OrangeCaramello\/recommended\/322540\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPrepare For Corporate Wars<br><br>Galactic Inheritors is a 4X Space Strategy game that is more about the space and less about exploration.
