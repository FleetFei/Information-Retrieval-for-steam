The game on its own is massive and polished to the brim. The Soundtrack is in a category on its own. And while the gameplay might seem simble at first glance, it is the different of ships and modes that give it a lot of variety.<br><br>Now, consider all the DLC that great shooting game companies have created to celebrate this game and you are in for a real treat... No other game gives us more shooting love than this (cave, capcom, raizing, sega dlc)<br><br>If you are into the genre, do give this game a chance.\t\t\t\t\t<div

is extremely high here, at least for this type of game.<br>And i doubted to buy this for a long time.<br>But it is completely worth it.<br><br><br>There are many levels to be unlocked in CS mode.<br>You can play every level with a preset ships, with preset fire and defensive power.<br>You can then unlock 9 different ships with your points gathered, and spend more points before starting each level to have your ships fire and defensive powers adjusted.<br><br>The 9 ships are very different and some work better for specific levels then others do, some give the ability to get much igher scores in a specific level thne others will allow you to, so this makes replaying levels you already completed a fun thing, because the experience feels different.<br><br><br><br>There are tons of bosses, even though alot of the bosses are the same visually, they gain new attacks and change their patterns regularly, so it did not bother me at all.<br>Some people reviewed it negatvely because bosses would be just recolored, but again , every fight and level does feel athentic and different, even the waves of enemies change their tactics, and the fun thing here is you can turn your ship because eventually your enemies don't just nter from the right side f he screen but can also enter from the left side, this gives an even more in depth fight.<br><br>Most levels exist out of between the 3 and 9 zone's and each zone is a couple of enemie waves with a boss at the end.<br>Sometimes a zone is just an enemie boss or an adaption of an already kille dboss, And sometimes you kill 3 or 4 bosse sin a row, which is very different from normal SHMUPS.<br>Where usually you compete a level or even two or thre elevels then fight a boss and move on.<br>I had fun even repeating some levels over a 8 times, so i definitely  have no problem with returning assest later on, it seesm to fit for a SHMUP like this.<br><br><br><br><br><br>AC MODE  is also very big and uch like CS mode, the difference is that, AC mdoe is optimized for 32:9 a Dual Screen Setup, so playing in 16:9 on one screen will give you two balck bars top and bottom.<br>However the feeling of AC does feel unique because the level is much longer and you can move a much further distance.<br><br>At frist i found the samller screen annoying, but eventually  i got used to it, and the longer level design feels fun now and then.<br>Honestly i spend more time in CS mode so far, and i am not even close to half of the game after 15 hours i unlocked 4 ships and maybe 30 levels, and accoridng to information the CS mode has over a 200 Levels, so there is still alot to do here.<br><br><br><br><br><br>DLC content is expensive again, but alot better then expected, All the DLC content will give you acces to a total of 24 different ships !<br>The downside howevre is that the extra ships can only be used in DLC mode and not in Arcade or CS mode.<br>But DLC mode has alot of levels to beat.<br>There are the normal modes for each ships which all contain 3 levels with mukltiple zones and satges.<br>And then there are the extra PAckas like the Taito Pack , Sega Pack, etcetera.<br>CS PAck 1 through 5 and even more.<br>Each of these packs have again multiple stages which have multiple zone's.<br>They also add some new bosses unseen in CS or Arcade mode so far, and you can also use the 9 normal ships from CS and AC mode in the DLC modes.<br><br><br>So in terms of gameplay time, the DLC modes add at least the same amount of gameplay time as CS mode does.<br>If not even more.<br>I think i will have many more hours of fun in this game, playing it now and ethen for a couple of hours in between some other game titles, this is a game that lasts for a long time, and has more  to offer then any other SHMUP on PC.<br>So absolutely worth it.<br><br>The only modern shmup that i played that felt close to as much as  fun as this was Jet's N Guns.<br>The other games i liked were mostly more old school type of SHMUPS, but none have as much content as this game.<br>Not even close to half as much of content.<br><br><br>Graphically the game also looks very good for a shmup.<br>There is support for Dynamic Super REsolutions.<br>And the game runs perfect 60 FPS in 7680x4320 Full screen VSYNC ON.<br>I did have to create a profile for the game in config panel.<br>Because to maintain smooth gameplay i had to set it to prefer Maximum performance in 7680x4320.<br>But 3840 x 2160 already worked smooth out of the box.<br><br>I would really advice this game , no mater the high price,<br>BUT ONLY if you are a real SHMUP fan, and like to beat scores and don't care about some returning assets.<br>If you just want to play a SHMUP game for an hour or two just to try it out, then this is not the right game for you.<br><br>However if you completed alot SHMUPS in the past and know what to expect from this type of game, you will own the most and best SHMUP by FAR.<br>Gameplay and visually.\t\t\t\t\t<div

I have nothing but praise for this game. With that said I know most STEAM users are going to look at the price point for this and think, &quot;They've GOT to be out of their minds!&quot; No they aren't This game is packed with so much content that I don't think there's a single game of its kind that can topple. I'll even say that you couldn't even combine 3 or 4 games together to get the amount of content that this game has to offer fans of the genre. <br><br>Aesthetically this game brings a simple and clean presentation to the table. The UI for ship combat is clean and simple to understand without too much info bombarding the player while they are struggling to keep their ship from a fiery demise. The 3D models are low in the polygon department, yet beautifully designed. Everything from simple cannon fodder enemies to the enormous bosses look great. <br><br>When it comes to blasting things into the next dimension this game brings it home. Every stage I've played so far in CS mode feels satisfying to navigate through while serving a healthy dose of destruction to everything in your wake. The slew of ship models in the game keep everything feeling fresh. Each ship brings something different to the table, be it bombs, options (bits), firing patterns, lasers, devastating counter lasers... You're going to have a different experience trying each one. <br><br>Areas feel a bit easy at first, but the difficulty steadily increases with each one you go to. And there's 200 of them in this mode. You'll be forced to learn enemy formation patterns, stage layouts, and boss attack patterns. Also, don't worry about encountering the same boss two or three times. While sometimes bosses look the same, their attack patterns sure as heck are not. Nothing I've encountered so far has felt unfair to me and every death I've had in an area has brought me closer to success on my next go around. This game does a great job of being difficult without being frustrating. <br><br>The music is another thing in this game that really caught me off guard. The soundtrack and sound design for this game is just superb. Everything feels new yet very nostalgic. It's as if I've been transported over 20 years back to the past to enjoy some of the older games from back in my youth. It's something that just feels great to experience while going through the game. With that said, the music still sounds fresh and sound effects are of a better quality than what us older people had from back in the day. <br><br>The thing that boggles my mind with the game is that I haven't even touch AC mode which contains 3 other modes within it and the original aspect ratio of the arcade version which will allow PC players to enjoy an authentic quarter crunching experience. There's one mode (Chronicle I believe) that has 3000 stages that are unlocked by the community. Each &quot;cabinet&quot; is like its own little universe which players can pick before starting AC mode. The further you and players in that cabinet get through Chronicles the more worlds you unlock. It adds a VERY lite MMO aspect to the game which will keep this game fresh far a good long while. <br><br>But for me, I'm content with trying to survive through CS mode. I don't see myself finishing that anytime soon since I'm on the less skilled side of the spectrum when it comes to Shoot'em Ups. Like I've stated in the beginning, your money will not go to waste on this game is you're a fan of the genre and have been waiting for a content heavy shmup to come across the STEAM store. PC has been getting a RIDICULOUS amount of fantastic shooters in the last two years and DARIUSBURST has easily sky rocketed to the top 3 in my opinion. This is a top shelf experience and a title that deserves to be in every shmup fan's catalogue.<br><br>Update: If you're a real fan of these game, get the Sega, Taito, Raizing, and CAVE DLCs\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19470862', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19470862' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19470862\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19470862' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19470862\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19470862', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19470862_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19470862_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t77 of 93 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19514579\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"25953862\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/acd4eca7427e71fc30af334c0c2fdac420bd97f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/acd4eca7427e71fc30af334c0c2fdac420bd97f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/acd4eca7427e71fc30af334c0c2fdac420bd97f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/\" data-miniprofile=\"25953862\">bVork<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/games\/?tab=all\">1,488 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/recommended\/\">44 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bVork\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 5, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best and most shmup you can buy on Steam.<br><br>It's hard to explain how huge this game is. Do you want a lengthy single-player campaign that will take you many hours to complete? CS mode is that. Do you want a classic Darius experience with multiple routes? It has two of those modes: Original and Original EX. Do you want a huge selection of different challenges? Chronicle mode has hundreds and hundreds of challenges with thousands of stages. Even if you aren't the type who plays arcade games repeatedly in order to get higher scores, there's still enough here to occupy you for hundreds of hours.<br><br>And how is this gigantic game? In a word: incredible. Dariusburst takes a different tack than many modern bullet hell shooters and instead goes for what I'd call popcorn hell. Huge swarms of tiny enemies and asteroids are everywhere. The bosses are huge, have a large variety of attacks, and are exhilarating to fight. Don't think it's just swarms and bosses, though: there are plenty of bullet-firing medium sized enemies and stage walls to contend with, too. Dariusburst is very much its own thing and doesn't cleanly fit into any of the shmup archetypes.<br><br>The scoring system is relatively simple, with a multiplier that ticks up when you destroy waves of enemies and gets reduced when you get hit. Kill an entire enemy wave and the you get a score bonus multiplied by your current multiplier. Kill the final enemy of a wave with your rechargeable laser or bomb and you get that same bonus multiplied by 16. This means the best scoring tactic is to kill everything and try to eliminate the final enemy of each wave with your laser\/bomb. This is easier said than done, so there's a lot of depth here in figuring out the ideal movement and timing for killing enemy waves. Bosses fire their own lasers and if you time it right, you can fire your own laser into that laser (like in G-Darius) and counter it for massive damage and large amounts of points if you kill the boss with the resulting counterburst.<br><br>The art design is great. It doesn't push a lot of polygons (this is an enhanced port of an arcade game based on a PSP game, after all) but the art more than makes up for it. Backgrounds can be astonishingly beautiful and the boss designs are great. There are also a large number of references to previous Darius games that are cool to pick out. Sound effects are well done. Nothing to write home about (apart from the wonderful boss alert siren), but they get the job done. The music is incredible. The &quot;Freedom&quot; song in the trailer is love-it-or-hate-it (I'm in the latter camp) but it's easily the least good of a long and lengthy soundtrack. The way the soundtrack is perfectly synchronized in the arcade modes is awe-inspiring.<br><br>There's only two real flaws with this game. The huge number of modes and missions means that high scores are scattered across a bunch of leaderboards rather than being concentrated and more competitive. Second, there's no practice mode for individual stages and bosses in AC mode. Some of the bosses (looking at YOU, Phantom Castle) have some really mean attacks and it would be nice to be able to practice them in AC mode without going through a series of stages beforehand. CS mode lets you select individual stages, so you can sort of use it for practice, but the aspect ratio is so different that it's not really the same thing as the AC mode boss fights.<br><br>All in all, I can't recommend this game enough. The price may be high but it is totally worth it given both the length and quality of Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19514579', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19514579' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19514579\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19514579' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19514579\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19514579', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19514579_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19514579_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19470442\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"7226401\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c321074c6dd527e941b11cacceeb3bc7ece32cd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c321074c6dd527e941b11cacceeb3bc7ece32cd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c321074c6dd527e941b11cacceeb3bc7ece32cd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/\" data-miniprofile=\"7226401\">Shadowhaxor<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/games\/?tab=all\">235 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shadowhaxor\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere was a time where if you had mentioned to me that you either had access to DariusBurst Another Chronicle, either via an arcade cabinet or by playing it on an iOS device, I would have given you a weird look. And not just any weird look, but the look that I wanted to steal your soul type of look as I really wanted a chance to try the game, just for once in my life. And with no access to either an iOS device or a Japanese PlayStation Portable, I was forced to merely watch videos of the game in action on Youtube. That is until recently when Degica stated they were porting the game over to not just the PlayStation Vita, but also the PlayStation 4 and the real shocker, the PC. That\u2019s all I needed to hear to get my shmup spirits lifted. Besides Darius, my other favorite shmups, Gradius and Thunderforce, were dead and buried, never to see the day of light again. And while Darius was still being carried on, its existence was always out of my reach, that is until now.   \u201cShoot-\u2019em-up: a fast-moving story or movie, of which gunfire is a dominant feature. Also known as a shmup\u201d DBCS is technically two games in one, which I believe was done to not only bring home that arcade experience but also to build upon it. Within the game, you have the ability to chose between DariusBurst Another Chronicle or AC mode, which includes all of the original arcade modes and original arcade screen ratio (perfect for dual screen or wide-format monitors and DariusBurst Chronicle Saviors or CS mode, which is the updated version of the game. And while you\u2019re free to choose either mode, there are a few differences. In AC mode you have access to the original arcade game modes; Original, Original EX Mode, Chronicle Mode and Event Mode. Original (Easy, Normal and Hard) is what I call the starter zone while Original EX Mode is a tougher version, tailor made for shmup experts (Expect, Extreme and Exceed) . You know, the same people that are able to single credit an entire game.<br><br>Chronicle mode however is what stands out here as you are presented with several different missions and objectives to complete, as the systems are broken up into several areas. And speaking of those objectives, they range anywhere from completing an area with just one credit, completing an area with multiple players, playing with a specific set of equipment and so forth. It\u2019s a definite time sink that\u2019s for sure. Thankfully you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s doing this, as everyone around the world who plays this game can also contribute to the AC progression via cabinets.  And just like it sounds, a cabinet is like a global progression save. For example, say everyone from a specific arcade was able to beat several areas, such as one of the specific multiplayer objectives. That objective would then contribute to unlocking more areas in the AC mode\u2019s game, and everyone who is accessing that cabinet can benefit and contribute to that going forward. This allows access to literally hundreds of new levels and even exclusive AC mode only bosses that you likely wouldn\u2019t unlock on your own.  And for those wondering, yes this is basically the NESYS  \/ NESiCAxLive Network being emulated at home. Oh, and when I mention hundreds of levels, I actually meant thousands! Yes, Taito is boasting that Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours\u2019s AC mode will include over 3000 total stages. So you\u2019ll be playing this for quite some time. No matter how you choose to play the game; Xbox 360, Xbox One, Dual Shock 4, Arcade Stick, as several other not very known controllers, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the game supports just about every gamepad and joystick. I can attest to that myself as I\u2019ve tested over 10 different configurations and were able to play the game with all of them.  And yes, you can even play with the keyboard, if you want to that is. I don\u2019t see why, but at least that option is available.<br><br>However in CS mode, the game changes. Similar to the chronicle mode in AC, this is mode is also laid out in a manner that you have set paths to take, after first area is completed that is. And unlike AC mode where you can chose the next stage, once you start the area you\u2019re stuck on until it\u2019s completed. You\u2019re also handicapped to an extent as you will find that some missions will not allow power ups to drop as well as restrict you to a specific ship. However you won\u2019t go into a mission blind as the overlay will tell you from the start what your ship will be, power up status, how many zones make up the area, and stage make-up.  Another difference is that while you play CS mode, you accumulate points based on how well you do in the zones you play through. Eventually after accumulating enough points you can trade them in for a new ship which you can then outfit with lasers, bombs and shielding. Using this tactic, you\u2019re no longer forced to use the preset ship, which will make certain levels that may have seemed impossible before a total cake walk with the new ship. However there\u2019s also a down side to this and every time you use that powered up ship, you will consume however many number of points you put into upgrading it. So you\u2019ll have to track how much you have or if you start running low, to take off some of that added power or simply use the preset ship. It\u2019s a nice method to keep you from overpowering your way to the end of the game. Via every transition in CS mode, you\u2019re provided pieces of the on-going story that you\u2019re currently taking place in. And while CS mode isn\u2019t as expansive as AC mode as it pales in comparison of possible stages (200+ vs 3000), it\u2019s still a fun addition and more up-to-date take on the Darius shooter. Also worth noting that CS mode is a single player affair while AC mode will allow up to 4 players. <br><br>You want ships? Well you won\u2019t be disappeared here, especially if you\u2019re familiar with the Darius games as there\u2019s a handful of them playable in-game; Gaiden, Assault, Next, Legend, Formula, Origin, Second, Genesis and one ship that isn\u2019t related to the Darius universe, the Murakumo, which is a CS exclusive ship btw. Apparently that ship hails from an older Taito game, one that I can\u2019t quite figure out. And while it\u2019s not directly related to the Darius ships of legend, the Murakumo is clearly a fantastic ship in its own right and is fun to play with, assuming you can afford the points required to pick it up. Fans of G-Darius may be slightly disappointed with the Genesis Silver Hawk as it does not feature it\u2019s capture ball. It\u2019s not a huge deal and it doesn\u2019t detract from the game, but it would have been nice to see it included. Even still, there are subtle differences between the ships, so each one is unique in that retrospect. If you\u2019ve ever played a Darius title, then you should be familiar on how the game functions. You pick your ship and off you go, pretty straight forward stuff. Thankfully the controls of the game are very responsive, and while playing the game I didn\u2019t have any issues as I dodge the incoming fire. That said, if I died it was due to me slipping up instead of the game.  <br><br>Read the entire review here - <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.theouterhaven.net\/2015\/11\/61199\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.theouterhaven.net\/2015\/11\/61199\/<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19470442', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19470442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19470442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19470442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19470442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19470442', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19470442_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19470442_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22519652\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"29569537\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e44790d27d07d0d703c14699947d6443c9283758.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e44790d27d07d0d703c14699947d6443c9283758.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e44790d27d07d0d703c14699947d6443c9283758_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/\" data-miniprofile=\"29569537\">Diebuster<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/games\/?tab=all\">97 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/headcrabrape\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">80.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIgnored by most western gamers, beloved by a niche &amp; reviled by others, the Darius series has always been a bizarre one... in more ways than one. Mechanically, it's in a specific place between &quot;mainstream shmup everyone and their grandmothers has played&quot; and &quot;turbo-hardcore bullet-curtain bonanza where the projectiles are many, the screen is busy and the ships are all piloted by girls or guys that all embody a specific anime fetish&quot;. Darius is accessible enough that the everyman may happen to give it a shot, but maybe not inaccessible enough for some members of the hardcore shmup community. As a result, you'll find that even the most beloved older entries in this series get reviews that complain about them being &quot;too tough&quot; or &quot;unfair&quot;, despite the difficulty being much more beginner-friendly than the average Cave game.<br><br>This is largely because Darius, unlike many other shooters of its kind where one hit means death, has an upgradable shield system; that way, the difficulty ramps up to crazy levels, but even low-level players can feel like they can achieve things. In that regard, this game's the best in the series; while not &quot;hand-holding&quot;, both Arcade and Chronicle Saviours modes put effort into guiding you towards high-level play, not through tutorials but through masterfully executed pacing. The first few CS missions, anyone could beat but it will just keep ramping up more and more, until you're fighting screen-filling monstrosities with barely any health. This format, however, is a double-edged sword; on one hand, CS mode's length creates a perfect learning curve. On the other hand, it sometimes loses the adventurous, over-the-top feeling of playing Gaiden or G; level assets and base designs for bosses are often blatantly recycled. The levels can feel like they were created (extremely well, but still) with a level creator and you will find yourself playing increasingly difficult versions of what is basically the same stage. Even including the recycling, though, DBCS still has far more content AND more solid, player-friendly mechanics than many of its rival shmups (I'm looking at you, Ikaruga stage 2) that I don't feel the price is hugely unwarranted. I paid 35 for it, and chances are it'll go down for good as time goes on; if the game grabs you in a particular way or if you're a really hardcore scrolling shmup fan, the price shouldn't bother you. Otherwise wait for a sale. I recommend checking out the second Taito arcade game collection on PS2; it has both Gaiden and G in it. My main reason for purchasing this was to support the series for what it represents as a whole moreso than to own this specific game. <br><br>The bosses have more specific, memorable patterns than ones found in more Cave-inspired games, where the bosses can kind of mesh together. I don't remember specific bullet patterns in Crimzon Clover that well, but the attacks of the Stare or Fossil-types in Darius will always stay with me.<br><br>The biggest difference between my view and that of the gaming mainstream lies in what many believe to add to a game's &quot;content&quot; or its &quot;bang for their buck&quot;; I don't really care if I can watch Flash cartoons on TV, watch real-life stand-up comic acts and be immersed in a &quot;living, breathing world&quot;; I don't need the oh-so-important &quot;quiet time&quot; and &quot;pacing&quot; of pushing a block onto a switch. I just want a game with non-stop, carefully-crafted, solid mechanics and design and DBCS does a great job at that. Those that think shmups are &quot;easy to make&quot; and thus should be ten bucks by default simply haven't thought deeply about what goes into a well-crafted game.<br><br>An issue I didn't have while playing normally, yet couldn't help but notice when recording footage for a video review, is the lack of a replay feature. Other nitpicks that some players found game-breaking are the lack of practice options for stages, no English translation for the arcade mode loading screens, no online multiplayer and no option to change the color of the ships without multiple controllers (yep, this is getting REALLY straw-grasping at this point). One legit issue is the lack of ship-capturing, which was a really cool element from G and Gaiden, and yet another extremely minor nitpick is that the Dragonball Z-esque beam war animation of the G-style ships, while still pretty freaking badass, is not quite quite as cool-looking as its original variant.<br><br>You get many different ships from all throughout the history of the series that allow for various play styles, either a little different or radically different depending on the type of burst shot or bomb attack, or whether you even have a burst shot or bomb attack at all - the ships from the first two games are the hardest to use because you only have basic fire &amp; missiles. A slightly annoying element is that the controls for the placement of your burst turret can be inverted depending on the ship you're using, which makes for an extra element you have to pay attention towards that wasn't really needed.<br><br>The art direction beyond the boss designs is possibly my biggest issue; the levels, while still full of enemies flying around in beautifully planned out routes like mechanical shoals, look pretty bland compared to the sheer beauty of G and Gaiden's settings. The bosses make up for this, though, being well-designed by famous anime mecha designers with the foresight of a stylishly blocky aesthetic not held back by hardware limitations (remember that Darius Burst started as a PSP game).<br><br>Graphically, it's worth pointing out the two-monitor &amp; widescreen set-up that this game allows, along with the visual downgrade of arcade mode that you'll experience otherwise. It's a port of the Dariusburst you'll experience in arcades, thus you'll get a minimized, inferior version if you're playing on one, non-widescreen monitor - the same issue you have when playing the original game on an emulator. Nonetheless I didn't find this to be game-breaking at all and I still find arcade mode engaging.<br><br>A common issue people have with this series is its music. From its very beginnings back in 1986, if you reached the iconically-designed, Go Nagai-esque King Fossil in the original Darius, your battle was accompanied by a melody that just... didn't sound quite right. For nearly three decades this tradition has been kept, this very game being heavily marketed using the level theme of the beginning of its Chronicle Saviours mode: a jazzy track with vocals that just feel... a tad off. This is because, from the get-go, Darius set out to create its own unique identity among the flood of shoot-em-ups of its era; a STRANGE identity. Surreal visuals, bizarre music written to inspire a variety of emotions; from relaxation, to getting high off your \u2665\u2665\u2665, to a psychotic fit; and, above all else, a marine theme and a difficulty to match that make you feel like you are mere bait in a massive space-ecosystem of mechanical sea life. It's a type of game with genuine artistic merit that is never acknowledged as such. <br><br>Just as Darius Gaiden, back in 1994, had its soundtrack panned by game magazines of the time (&quot;[like] some fat bint warbling away like an Old Spice advert&quot; so does Chronicle Saviours' most popular English upload have a comment section flooded with &quot;wtf is this garbage music&quot; comments. The gaming community doesn't seem very accepting of music that gets across emotions that go beyond what is typical, but the bizarre nature of Zuntata's music for Darius is obviously not a result of incompetent songwrighting; the falsettos have their carefully-controlled purpose. It's not Trout Mask Replica-level, but it still helps contribute hugely to this series' sense of identity.<br><br>So, long story short; a unique and fun game, part of a fun and unique series. If you're not quite sure if this is your thing, try Gaiden and G first and see what impact they have on you and if you think it's too expensive, just wait until the next sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22519652', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22519652' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22519652\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22519652' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22519652\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22519652', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22519652_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22519652_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19474101\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"1611352\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b2\/b246b78443127a6ef58af7e2617e51399084b1dd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b2\/b246b78443127a6ef58af7e2617e51399084b1dd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b2\/b246b78443127a6ef58af7e2617e51399084b1dd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/\" data-miniprofile=\"1611352\">\u221e Pig<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/games\/?tab=all\">323 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/infinitypig\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">130.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 4, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor fair disclosure, I was part of the closed beta testing team for Dariusburst CS.<br><br>An absolutely solid game, well worth the asking price involved. Having first hand experience with a DBAC arcade cabinet, I would've paid twice as much as this for the AC mode alone, regardless of the content of the CS mode.<br><br>Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours is a full conversion of one of the more successful recent arcade machines made, both in Japan and the west as well. The cab had 2 big widescreens plugged next to each other in 32:9 ratio, and the Steam version supports the same configuration - Put two widescreens together, and it'll run in Dual Screen mode. It's an absolutely INCREDIBLE spectacle for anyone even remotely into shmups, with the only thing missing being the subwoofer under your seat literally shaking you on boss warnings. <br><br>Original and Original EX modes are your standard arcade runs - Pick a route, play 3 stages, chase high scores. For the score chasers among everyone, this is going to be where you'll be spending most of your time. Original mode contains Easy, Normal and Hard routes, with Original EX containing Expert, Extreme, and Exceed difficulties. The balance between all the stages is very, very well done.<br><br>Chronicle Mode is almost like an online social mission mode based mode, with a gigantic map full of different planets and several different missions. Each planet is represented by a hex grid, and every hex represents a run of stages or bosses with clear conditions and rules. Completing this mission and meeting these conditions will liberate that area, unlocking all the missions around it. The interesting thing here, is that you are working together with everybody else online set to the same cabinet number as you, so you're working in a joint effort to unlock and complete Chronicle Mode together, not just yourself.<br><br>The CS mode is the home conversion exclusive mode, with gameplay designed for a single screen for people that don't have dual screen setups. This contains new stages, music, new bosses, a new ship, unique rules, storyline and a LOT of music \/ sound from the older Darius games in the series. For people looking for a progression based game with a start and an ending (and a game that fills the whole screen instead of letterboxe 32:9) then CS mode is where you'll want to be playing.<br><br>Ultimately it's a HUGE game, pretty much suitable for shmup players of all skills levels. There's something for the hardcore and something for the casual audience too.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19474101', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19474101' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19474101\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19474101' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19474101\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19474101', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19474101_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19474101_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19556826\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Joe_Piscopo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"31870523\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/8777a117f902c9b20e9b8bfe672acf559aa87fdf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/8777a117f902c9b20e9b8bfe672acf559aa87fdf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/8777a117f902c9b20e9b8bfe672acf559aa87fdf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Joe_Piscopo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"31870523\">Joe Piscopo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Joe_Piscopo\/games\/?tab=all\">893 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Joe_Piscopo\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Joe_Piscopo\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 7, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSay what you will about the price point but this game has an amount of content that no other game in the genre can boast.

Oh wow, where do I start?<br><br>You might have looked at the price point and went, &quot;oh my god, that's high!\u201d Believe me, I was like you too when I found out about it. I mainly bought this for its Arcade port of DARIUSBURST Another Chronicle, considering how hard it is to find the real cabinet version of the arcade game plus tons of new added content, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a really good buy.<br><br>The game is fun, it\u2019s separated into two parts, CS Mode which is the new single player content made exclusively for this game and AC Mode, which is the arcade port of Another Chronicle. You have 9 (or was it 8?) different ships to choose from and some of them are from the older Darius games which was a pleasant surprise for me. (They even changes the music to older Darius music if you play as them in CS Mode, neat). The boss fights are great and the game boasts a pretty darn awesome soundtrack too, but I think a lot of us can agree the \u201cfreedom\u201d song on the trailer is kinda meh. <br><br>The amount of levels you can play in this game is hugeeeeee! Mainly in CS Mode and Chronicle Mode in AC Mode. But a little warning. Sure, the game has tons of content but there's some repetition here and there and maybe some tweaks between the levels. Something like, &quot;beat these levels and bosses with this ship&quot;. I think that might also be the case with Chronicle mode in AC Mode but I haven't really touched it yet during the time this review was written. But still, I enjoyed every second of it. And it really helps to get better for beating AC mode with 1 credit. Hey, on the bright sight, most of other shmups just have around 5 or 6 levels and this one have waaaay more than that. Fun!<br><br>If you\u2019re a shmup fan, you definitely should get this but maybe when it's on sale, because honestly I still think it's a little bit pricey.

Other than that this game is great!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30766519', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30766519' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30766519\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30766519' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30766519\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30766519', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30766519_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30766519_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30268286\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/celeriac\/recommended\/377870\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"251782979\">Celery<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 41.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours is the latest entry in Taito's long running Darius franchise.  If you're unfamiliar with the series, it's characterized by sea-life based enemies and awesome soundtracks scored by Zuntata.  I was interested in the game for a long time, but like many I held off on purchasing due to its considerable price point.  Although I like it now, I must admit the \u201cFreedom\u201d song from the trailer was initially a turn off as well.  It took a while, but I'm glad I was eventually able to play DBCS because it's quite good.<br><br>This title contains a port of the arcade game Dariusburst Another Chronicle EX, and a specially created single player campaign called CS Mode.  In case you don't know, the arcade game is originally played on a fairly large screen.  This means the arcade port will likely be letter-boxed to fit the shape of your monitor.  This can initially be a little jarring, but I didn't have any issues getting used to it.  I don't have the equipment to test it myself, but it does have dual monitor support.  There is also something called Chronicle Mode, which I believe to be an online campaign similar to CS mode.  I don't have any experience with Chronicle Mode, so further information about it will not be contained within this review.  The arcade port is set up similarly to other Darius games.<br><br>Original Mode contains zones A-L and Original EX has zones O-Z.  As you play through the game you choose a three letter route.  Letters farther into the alphabet represent higher difficulty stages.  Route ADH is considered to be the easiest route, and QUZ is the hardest.  The game also allows the player to choose between a one credit entry and unlimited credit entry.  Choosing unlimited credits will not record a score.  The credit option combined with the flexibility of routes allows the player to make the game as easy or as difficult as they wish.  There are nine playable ships to choose from, though one of them only appears in CS Mode.<br><br>The abilities of each ship vary extensively.  Most of them have a burst weapon that can be utilized with proper timing to counter enemy bursts.  Two ships don't need need to time counterbursts, and a few of them lack the ability to burst entirely.  Several have fixed bursts (essentially a detachable burst drone) that can be aimed to form bullet blocking barriers.  As you fly through each stage there will occasionally be enemies that will drop orbs corresponding to the color of the enemy.  The red ones will upgrade the weapons system, the green ones will upgrade bombs\/missiles, and blue ones are for ARM\/shields.  Unlike the typical one hit deaths often seen in STGs, you're able to take hits until the ship runs out of shielding.  I don't know what the exact hitbox dimensions are, but it's close to the entire size of your ship.  To compensate for this, the bullet patterns aren't as dense as danmaku style shooters.  The types of enhancements obtainable vary from ship to ship.  Some of them are easier to use than others, and they have different scoring multipliers to compensate.  In order to get more points you'll want to destroy all the enemies in each wave, use your burst frequently (if there is one), and kill bosses by counterbursting.  It may all seem a little overwhelming at first, but fortunately there is a great way to learn how to use each ship effectively.<br><br>CS Mode consists of well over one hundred unique missions (specifically 186 according to one source I found).  I'm unable to confirm the exact number of missions myself, despite the fact that the bulk of playtime consists of playing this mode.  Regardless of the exact number, I can confidently say there is enough content there to keep most players busy for a very long time.  The missions heavily vary in difficulty and length.  Most of them simply require winning, but a few do have alternate objectives such as obtaining a certain score and finishing within a time limit.  Each mission has a preset ship which is the intended way to play, however if a mission is too challenging the player can use in game currency (earned from completing missions) to buy a heavily upgraded custom ship for the mission.  I enjoyed using the presets, and found it to be a great way to learn how to play effectively with each ship.  As I grew more experienced I found that some of the ships I initially disliked eventually became my favorites.  You will fight many of the same bosses over and over, but I found there to be more than enough variety to keep me entertained.  CS Mode sports music from many Darius games and playing it made me a fan of Zuntata's work.  I've found myself listening to the tracks outside of the game multiple times.  I enjoy many of the songs, but if I could only suggest a few I'd say that \u201cOlga Breeze\u201d, \u201cHinder One\u201d, and \u201cGood-bye my earth\u201d are worth listening to even if you don't buy this game.<br><br>DARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours is an excellent STG.  Between the arcade modes and CS Mode there is a ton of great content.  I only have two criticisms of this game.  First and foremost the backgrounds for boss fights can sometimes be a little drab, although you probably won't spend much time looking at them.  My second criticism is the lack of a practice mode.  CS Mode acts as sort of a substitute, but an actual practice mode would have been much appreciated.   Although I believe DBCS would be a great first shmup, the full price cost is probably a little prohibitive for those wanting to dip their feet into the genre.  If you're the type of person that enjoys playing for 1ccs and high scores though, you shouldn't have any trouble getting a good value out of the game.  I'd have no trouble recommending this game to STG fans, especially ones looking for a non-danmaku shmup, and also to people that have always wanted to try a thing called tuna sashimi.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/curator\/25660729-CelerySpin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Like the review?

First thing you should know about Darius Burst Chronicles is that it has content, in spades.  The main arcade mode is a branching path where you play three levels in a row.  You can mix and match the levels in quite a few ways.  It also had 10 unique bosses.  Then there is Chronicle Savior mode with hundreds of levels and various challenge.  You will not play everything in this game, you just won't.  The original arcade machine was meant to be unlocked by everyone at the arcade.<br><br>The great thing about DB:CS is that it balances the difficulty quite well for most gamers.  It doesn't go to the extreme lengths a lot of modern bullet hell schmups go to.  Thus it is more approachable by your average gamer.  However, it can still offer a healthy challenge.<br><br>The game also has a rich scoring system for you to rack up a multiplier and tactically kill your enemies with your beam for more points.  You get the most points by scoring the deathblow on a boss with a counterbeam.  So there is depth there if you want it.<br><br>If you like Shoot 'em ups, this game you will probably enjoy this game.  Now the $50 price is steep, but I feel they can also justify it with the amount of content they give you.  If you don't want to spend that much, an entirely reasonable position, this can make a great game to pick up on sale.  At $20 it would be a no brainer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30212737', 'recent_short' );
