There's no outstanding faults in either the dub or sub, but not much in the way of original content either. Despite that, there still exists a fair degree of care in the presentation of the movie's themes, with the top two being totalitarianism &amp; man's &quot;suppressed monster&quot;.<br><br>Background art and music is what we've come to expect from Production I.G.- sublime, world-building, and decadent. Would probably be even more remarkable if given enough time.<br><br>Animation quality is a mixed bag; the design is representative of the source material's intentionally lifeless atmosphere, but translates poorly to anime, since everybody is, well.... lifeless. The lack of detail in even the most basic shots undermines what the narrative has to offer, which makes it difficult to root for anybody currently in a scene. Sometimes I feel as if this would be better as live-action, especially when it gets edgy in a few parts.<br><br>In spite of Loups=Garous great themes, it's definitely not character driven. Most, if not all characters in the film seem like flat, pre-established archetypes too often seen in modern I.P.-  <br><br>-Ayumi's a stoic, anti-societal kuu-dere<br><br>-Haduki's the clumsy, overly anxious type that has trouble expressing her emotions<br><br>-Mio's a half-baked Mary Sue that appears out of nowhere in the beginning to assist the characters with superb hacking skills, having no in-depth explanation as to how she acquired those skills, for which Loups=Garous relies on the audience to make assumptions about her character<br><br>It also doesn't help that Sentai Filmworks labels Ayumi as a guy, going so far as giving &quot;him&quot; a male voice actor in the dub and even retaining that gender-swap in the subtitles, when said character is a definite female in original Japanese, regardless of character design. It might of been an okay marketing decision for their Blu-Ray, but it's still glaringly misleading.<br><br>Although the characters felt unoriginal, I certainly didn't hate them. They carried the movie fairly well when they had to, and managed to pull off the sentiment charm when it was required. Not everyone will feel the same way though.<br><br>There's nothing wrong in expecting Production I.G. to go all out when they make anime movies (since they definitely nailed Break Blade &amp; Eden of the East), but even if corners are cut, movie's like this can still be worth looking at, if you're willing to give 'em a chance.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25760350', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25760350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25760350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25760350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25760350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25760350', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25760350_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25760350_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/518500\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25760350"]}
