I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.<br><br>Claire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.<br><br>In Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.<br><br>The gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.<br><br>Monsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet\/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.<br><br>Sanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.<br><br>Normally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.<br><br>And its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.<br><br>I'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.<br><br>Claire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.<br><br>It's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.<br><br>Speaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and &quot;WTF&quot; moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.<br><br>I might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.<br><br>A bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11360051', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11360051' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11360051\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11360051' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11360051\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11360051', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11360051_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11360051_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11157617\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/goldenkitten\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"101899060\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/305d822836378279c91c25a3230d28838025b11e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/305d822836378279c91c25a3230d28838025b11e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/305d822836378279c91c25a3230d28838025b11e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/goldenkitten\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101899060\">Goldenkitten<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/goldenkitten\/games\/?tab=all\">666 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/goldenkitten\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/goldenkitten\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 9, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA better Silent Hill than the last three Silent Hills. Claire takes the Corpse Party route of using old school graphics but newer gameplay design decisions, mechanics, and general feel to create a rather excellent Horror game all its own. Only where Corpse Party was going for a distinctly Eastern style of Horror, Claire instead uses the more generalized Silent Hill approach.<br><br>Though it won\u2019t win anyone over who\u2019s a serious graphics ***** the stylized 16-bit graphics are wonderfully detailed and manage to suck you in to the atmosphere in a way you\u2019d never think a 2D game could. Sprites are dark, apocalyptic, gruesome, and backed up by some good lighting that really plays with you trying to set off a sense of claustrophobia. It\u2019s put against an amazing soundscape that ranges between terrifying, foreboding, soothing, and even upbeat depending on what the scene calls for in a way rarely seen outside of games with larger budgets. <br><br>Gameplay is centered around exploring an almost mazelike environment (using a suspiciously Silent Hill-esque map), finding key items, and running from roaming monsters. Claire is the first 2D horror game I\u2019ve found where running and hiding from your enemies actually works and serves as an example of how to do this for future games. Though you can\u2019t destroy enemies you can sprint for short distances, and even perform an evasive jump to get past them. This jump isn\u2019t overpowered and you can get yourself killed but it offers a greater deal of tactical options instead of other games that have tried this (such as Knock-Knock) where you would wind up getting stuck and simply couldn't do anything to save yourself. Enemies are surprisingly intimidating and have even spooked me a few times but the game is well designed meaning that if there is an enemy there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s a hiding spot or long corridor to run from them nearby (enemies can chase you across screens) giving you a chance to survive. <br><br>Without spoilers the story is somewhere between Silent Hill and something more concrete. Though it drops you in with few answers there does seem to be a greater sense of \u201cwhat\u2019s happening\u201d as the game continues though there are some surreal encounters with other denizens. Short version of what you can learn in the first five minutes; you are Claire, your mother is in the hospital, stuff goes REALLY bad really quick. I won\u2019t say more than that but suffice it to say it\u2019s kept me invested and coming back.<br><br>There are a handful of bugs mostly associated with how the map displays icons. But these are few, far-between, and don't really effect the game when they do happen. But worth pointing out they\u2019re there for the sake of being fair.<br><br>So all in all Claire is a fantastic game, a brilliant triumph for the slowly building trend of using old-school graphics for horror games, and a must own for any horror game fan; especially lovers of Silent Hill.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11157617', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11157617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11157617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11157617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11157617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11157617', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11157617_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11157617_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11136549\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"40120843\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/dee433975c51ee0dbc8a334339d656820617cd3c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/dee433975c51ee0dbc8a334339d656820617cd3c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/dee433975c51ee0dbc8a334339d656820617cd3c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40120843\">Anmy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/games\/?tab=all\">340 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AnmyTheMerc\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 8, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though I do like the game, I have encoutered several bugs, that affect the ability to finish it all together. The major issue is that some times after you reload after death, some certain key obstacles (like closed doors) are back, but the key item you need to open them is already gone. This literally made the game unfinishable for me, and damn near it's end too.<br>Don't get me wrong - for once we got a really good horror game, that reminds me of Clock Tower series, and the performance is mostly memorable and well-executed by devs, so I would definetely recommend buying it. Just keep a separate save file, so you won't be needing to start all over again like I do.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11136549', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11136549' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11136549\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11136549' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11136549\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11136549', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11136549_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11136549_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12675330\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198098367721\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"138101993\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198098367721\/\" data-miniprofile=\"138101993\">Crulgius<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198098367721\/games\/?tab=all\">66 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198098367721\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198098367721\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">32.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 28, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(<b>Note:<\/b> If don\u2019t want to read long points go pass the line)<br><br><b>Intro:<\/b> In the game you play as protagonist by the name Claire who is trying search for her comatose mother while searching for answers within the darkness about herself, however be aware you\u2019re not alone so now let explain base off my experience why I would recommend Claire.<br><br><b>Atmosphere\/Environment:<\/b> In general atmosphere is important in a horror game if the goal if not scare to at least cause a form of discomfort in terms of survival-horror which for a 2D horror game like Claire for the most part does a great job in this regard when it comes to sounds, visuals and music in general will keep you on edge throughout the game now that is not to say there are no areas of calm moments but they are far in between.  For instance areas that are calm have eerie sense of sadness, loneliness, abandonment and little hope while areas that are chaotic have intense emotions of fear, suffering, hopelessness and madness while at certain times the atmosphere takes a combination of these two (To experience fully recommend not going objective too fast and also lights out and headphones on.)<br><br><b>Gameplay Mechanics:<\/b> Another thing that the game does an excellent job in keeping tension going is by putting players in the role as Claire who is put in this nightmarish world with only defense is a dog (warns of danger), blocking doors (if possible) , running and hiding.  Now when it comes to the running and hiding aspect of the game it should be noted here that when running your energy will drain quickly so use sparingly and once enemies see you they become relentless and by breaking down doors or crawling through from certain vents so it\u2019s up to as the player to use both cunning and understanding of the environment around you both in terms of running and hiding, but understand since they are unpredictable if player is careless they will use the environment against you or if the player tries to hide in plain sight they will draw you out.  Last thing that keeps the tension going is a balance act you would have to maintain between the protagonist\u2019s health and sanity.  Now at first the balancing act starts off easy but as progress it will become bit more difficult terms of enemies that attack you physically and\/or mentally to environmental changes that you will not expect to occur.<br> <br><b>Inventory Management:<\/b> Now the game Claire to a certain degree portrays a specific type of inventory management in the form of a backpack which contains a limited amount of square space and each square space can only hold one item in each one combined with idea that items must be used wisely which provides a challenge of its own, while I like this feature there is one flaw to it which the only way Claire describes the item is by the player picking it up which results in loss of space to point where you would have to use items whether you need to or not to make room for items you need in order to complete your objective and\/or side quest as you progress (suggestion: create secondary storage for items for later use or create an option where it describes the item and yes or no if the player wants to pick it up.) <br><br><b>Map:<\/b> The map in general is one those learning curve type maps that you would either love it or hate it which I love it because not only does it help navigate throughout without being completely lost which provides a challenge in itself, but also the design remind me a little bit of horror games like siren.<br><br><b>Puzzles:<\/b> Now the puzzles in Claire in general come in two different types optional which you can skip if you want to (note: recommend not skipping more variety and little more challenging then main puzzles and some connect with the story in a way) and main game puzzles that you have to complete in order to progress which both of these types of puzzles not only help with the overall pacing but provide challenge within themselves.<br><br><b>Replay ability:<\/b> Now there is replay ability in terms of not only multiple endings and achievements, but also if you\u2019re the type of player after completing want bonus challenge Claire offers this in the form of two basic difficulty modes hard and nightmare.<br><br><b>Overall Story:<\/b> The story in Claire is a mix bag here it\u2019s excellent in one aspect and another way it struggles fully stay up float.  Now what Claire does excellent is how the game presents itself by having Claire herself narrate in the form of text her thoughts and emotions while combined with the emotions she displayed was believable to the point I find myself caring what\u2019s going happen to her base of the choices I made, certain sequences (memories) in Claire will occur which will allow to have idea not only what her past was like but also the reason behind her situation which is designed and set up in way that never over stays its welcome combined with items you find to put in your journal that which all together seems to use a little bit of Silent Hill formula.  Now don\u2019t get wrong I found story interesting and I don\u2019t expect games like Claire to hold my hand, however the story isn\u2019t perfect I just couldn\u2019t shake the feeling off there were certain plots arguably missing, just there to be in the game or\/and seemed a bit on the rushed side which the main issue behind this is that the game Claire seems reference the individual enough to point where he is very memorable but not much to go on to actually piece together what happen to him or maybe it was just simply lost in translation with me.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Atmosphere\/environment: Will either scare or keep you on edge.<br><\/li><li>Gameplay Mechanics: Will keep tension going throughout.<br><\/li><li>Inventory Management: is present in terms of space and item use.<br><\/li><li>Map: Provide well balance learning curve.<br><\/li><li>Replay ability: Is present in terms of multiple endings, achievements and contains two difficulty settings hard and nightmare.<br><\/li><li>Overall Story: Believable story due to Claire displaying her thoughts and emotions text and body movement and\/or expressions, sequences that occur (memories) that don\u2019t over stay its welcome because of how it was designed and set up.<br><br><b>Mix:<\/b><br><br><\/li><li>Puzzles: come in two different types optional (which are slightly more challenging and connect with the story in a way) while main puzzles provide certain challenge and do also have a connection to story but variety is not there in my opinion.  <br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br><br><\/li><li>Inventory Management doesn\u2019t give option to store or pick item up or not.<br><\/li><li>Overall Story: The story is interesting the problem is certain plots are either missing, just in there to be in the game or\/and a little bit on the rushed side.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed my time playing Claire will go back to explore for the alternate endings, atmosphere\/environment and gameplay.  <br><br>I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan or new to both the gameplay and genre.<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12675330', 'summary' );

(&quot;nightmare&quot; may prove more of a challenge though).<br><br>The severeal endings are contingent on how many side quest one chooses to do, which is nice because it gives one incentive to explore the world a bit more.<br><br>The game can be completed in two hours if one were to rush though it. However for the kind of person who enjoys to explore and discover everything a game has to offer, I can see maybe 10 hours of playtime for this title.<br><br>One feature I would've liked to have seen in the game is an option to play it without taking any damage, so I could go through it and enjoy the pixel enviorments at my own leisure, but that is of course a minor thing that doesn't detract from the experience at all.<br><br>If the game does have a major flaw it would be that the dialouge, and story could have used some work, while I understand everything that was going on, the story could have fleshed out the characters a bit more.<br><br>There is no combat in the game, and while this is an interesting mechanic, I felt it could have been handled better than it was, for example there were not enough spots to hide. <br><br>The flashlight did not do much and wasn't required to beat the game, this felt like a missed opportunity gameplay wise, as I feel flashlight use could have been made more useful. To be specific maybe the flashlight could make you immune to being scared while it's in use, or perhaps it could temporarily scare off monsters?<br><br>The biggest issue I have with the game is there are parts of it that seem impossible to complete unless you have a whole bunch of health items stacked up, and this is becuase of your &quot;sanity meter&quot;. If one has low &quot;sanity&quot; they start taking damage, the worst part is aside from items, there isn't really a way for one to restore thier &quot;sanity&quot;, or at least none I could figure out.<br><br>Laslty it would be nice to have an option view all of the endings\/notes one has unlocked.<br><br>This game currently would garner a 3.5\/5 from me, if the game fixed all of the above I would have rated it higher.<br>Still it's a neat little indie title, worth one's money, and especially worth one's cash if bought on sale!<br>- Celx Requin\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13879584', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13879584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13879584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13879584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13879584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13879584', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13879584_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13879584_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15189204\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"47126349\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/0872d053f80f2ff4ef26f91e9aba28fd9aaa2de0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/0872d053f80f2ff4ef26f91e9aba28fd9aaa2de0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/0872d053f80f2ff4ef26f91e9aba28fd9aaa2de0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47126349\">Splain<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/games\/?tab=all\">93 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Splain\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRating 7.5\/10<br><br>Claire is a 2d psychological horror game very reminiscent of  Silent HIll. You play as Claire as she navigates multiple locals to complete missions and progress the overall story. You have no weapons, only a lighter\/flightlight, your wits and your pet dog (Who will only warn you of nearby enemies, but I suppose that is more than my cat would do) to navigate through the nightmarish halls to out run and out smart the lurking monsters. <br><br>Speaking of enemies, some will attack you physially while some will attack you psychologically, causing you to become scared. If Claire stays scared for to long she will begain to take physical damage, so in essence you have two health pools to manage. <br><br>Like any survival game, you can explore and scavenge for health items, notes and batteries for your flashlight, not to mention some pretty interesting puzzles to find and solve. If you explore the right locations you will occassionally come across other survivors who can offer you side missions to do while exploring. These are not mandontory and can be skipped all together. <br><br>There is replayability value in the game as there are multiple endings you can unlock based on what you do in game. Completing the story with a decent amount of exploration you can expect to finish up in 4 to 5 hours.<br><br>If you enjoy survival horror I highly recommend this game. I also recommend the coffee, again.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15189204', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15189204' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15189204\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15189204' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15189204\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15189204', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15189204_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15189204_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14452799\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/minifigs\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"53387320\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5628cb648ffe7dec9ca5f376d49238cf1ad31338.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5628cb648ffe7dec9ca5f376d49238cf1ad31338.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5628cb648ffe7dec9ca5f376d49238cf1ad31338_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/minifigs\/\" data-miniprofile=\"53387320\">F\ud83d\ude08CK HOPE<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/minifigs\/games\/?tab=all\">2,762 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/minifigs\/recommended\/\">75 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/minifigs\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDecent enough indie horror walking sim game. If you own it from a bundle or something, I would say install it, it's only 500MB and it's worth trying out. For US$9, I wouldn't buy it.<br><br>The check point save system really hurts the game though. Replaying the same spoooooky room a second time is just predictable and boring, which is the antithesis of horror or scary. The map also doesn't have any indicators or anything so if you get lost it can get frustrating. I probably won't finish it, but I didn't mind checking it out while some cards fell into my lap.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14452799', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14452799' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14452799\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14452799' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14452799\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14452799', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14452799_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14452799_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18222013\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019205444\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"58939716\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019205444\/\" data-miniprofile=\"58939716\">sitebender<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019205444\/games\/?tab=all\">2,085 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019205444\/recommended\/\">293 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019205444\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 27, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClaire awakens from a happy dream about happy friendship bears to find herself at home in bed with shadows lurking over her. The shadows close in and you're given a choice to call for your parents, hide or get out of bed. The room is covered in pink, but marred in shadow. The only light sources come from a clock that reads 3:33 and an open window that lets in some moonlight. When the girl hops out of bed to scurry out of the room in a 2D side-scrolling fashion, she's yanked back toward the shadows that lurk over her bed.<br><br>After that she's allowed to scour her darkened how looking for the brother and parents. Windows illuminate dark hallways that have shadowy birds flying through them. The screen begins to flicker, shake and glitch as each room gets darker than the next. Static on the television, the only lights pop as Claire walks by and shadowy soccer balls roll by her feet. Minutes tick by, but the next clock still reads 3:33 as well. The moon must be shrouded as no more light shines through the window's open curtains.<br><br>When Claire reaches her parents room, everyone is gone, the bed is floating and her mom tells her that everything's going to be okay. That's when Claire wakes up curled in a ball on a chair inside the St. Barbara hospital pediatrics ward. There's a photo of a happy couple in the background with a different photo of a beach over it. The room is lit by a light overhead and red candle that flickers. The curtains are half open and its pitch black outside.<br><br>Claire is a young blonde girl with barrettes in her hair wearing a hoody and jeans. Claire knows that she needs to stop sleeping there, because that place is getting to here. From that point Claire wanders the hospital floor. The place is pristine and nothing out of the ordinary other than she's the only person there. There are still hints that a black fog or haze watches her from just beyond the light's reach.<br><br>She can run, jump and open doors to get from one area to the next. We can assume that since she's in a hospital that's the reason why she can't run fast or run a long distance without running out of breath. There are plenty of maxcell batteries and cola for her to collect marked as shinny objects here and there to catch her gaze.<br><br>Several doors are locked or blocked. She can even hear the television on inside and the doors that are unlocked Claire wants to leave the inhabitants in peace. Its routine for Claire, she says its always been quiet at night. Hallway after hallway, they begin to get darker and unfriendly. After searching through a dozen hallways its safe to say that Claire is alone.<br><br>There is then a sign of life, her phone rings,s he answers, but the person on the other end hangs up. She finds plenty of things to interact with, plaques, couches to curl upon and rooms that let her save any progress. Upon reaching a coffee room, Claire says that there are still a few hours before school starts and she needs to get back home. Then she says she misses sleeping in her own bed. So it seems that Claire has a conflict. Stuck in a hospital overnight that she needs to go home from. Waking up in a chair rather than a bed. She's in street clothes instead of a hospital gown.<br><br>It is just an ordinary, mundane hospital. The water tastes like dirt, there is a rickety elevator that almost breaks with her in it. The elevator opens on the wrong floor. She feels that she must have pushed the wrong button. Soon the rooms become uninviting. Rust seeps out from vents. The bright lights get dim. There's a scratching sound and before she realizes, she's staring at a hospital bed with a red candle on it and a shadowy mist hovering over it.<br><br>The mist slowly consumes the entire room before  Claire herself is on a table with red candles around her on the floor, shadowy figures walking around and a giant, fleshless, meaty creature hovering above her. Does it have a face? Is that a face? No is that also a face? Are those four giant teeth or four giant nails? What are those dozen shadow people around her? Claire is stuck, something is holding her down.<br><br>It all comes to an end though as a barking German Shepard makes the shadow men dissipate. She knows this German Shepard, its her dog Anubis or Ani as Claire likes to say. With her faithful dog here, the bond is broken and she's free to move while the fleshless muscle creature stays clung to the ceiling.<br><br>Claire realizes her phone is busted, the hospital is dark with only dim lights or red candles here and there, so she's forced to use her lighter to guide the way. This lighter never runs out of fuel and she soon finds a flashlight to light the way, but it requires Maxcell batteries.<br><br>The hospital has changed completely and its in disarray. Furniture strewn about, doors have giant chains and locks around them. Some hallways are blocked off with rubble. Claire has to push things aside to get into doors. Something happened in this hospital.<br><br>With her faithful dog here with her, she needs to meet the challenge to survive going room to room in a labyrinthine complex. Going through air ducts, elevators, doors and so on. She checks each closet, bathroom stall, locker and trash bag looking for items to stay alive. Lucky for her she has a map that shows where she'll be headed, what doors are locked and which ones need keys. Claire can pick a door's lock with a hairpin and enough time to do it. With each cooridoor containing plenty of doors, Claire can find herself lost with each new hallway without checking her map.<br><br>Anubis growls, Claire wonders what it is, but she soon learns to recognize that when Ani growls, there's a presence with them. A shadowy figure with a white outline of a face that will charge the two of them and chase them from room to room. If she hides beyond a door, the creature will smash the glass and begin to course through the door turning it black until the being springs into the room with them. Their only resolve then is to hide in a laundry basket or closet. The creatures make static screeches to crawl up Claire's spine.<br><br>Every time a shadow creature touches her it drains Claire's health and the only way she restores it is by chugging various types of cola or coffee. She also has a sanity factor and the more she sees, the crazier she can become. Depleting health or sanity mean most certain death for her.<br><br>Claire's only real power is to face her fears and bait these shadow creatures through room after room until she finds a closet to hide in so the creature can walk by. This hospital is a hostile place with scarce resources. There is a limited bounty of batteries and cola so when she's out, that's it.<br><br>As isolating, atmospheric and terrifying as the hospital can be, there's someone else in St. Barbara. There's another patient here that Claire will inevitably find. You get choices for Claire at key moments, but I feel they are of little consequence.<br><br>The danger comes from more than these creatures and giant shadow reapers, there are a few hazards here and there, such as her own mind working against her. Claire has dark hallucinations of when she picked a dog from the pound. Her mind twists the memory into something horrifying. The dogs int heir kennels are only a pair of glowing eyes. You can begin to wonder what is her reality.

Enjoy getting lost in map screens? Do you like jumpscares?<br><br>If the answers to any of the above are &quot;yes&quot;, play this game- it's pretty cheap.<br><br>This game \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 with you- it has a few Hideo Kojima moments- such as one where looking at a specific item makes it appear that your computer has the blue screen of death- as well as a number of pretty well designed scares. The main enemies never stop being scary- mostly because they can kill you before you can say &quot;where are those hellish screams coming from?&quot; <br><br>This game actually, legitimately, terrifies me on occasion- but mostly it makes me grind my teeth in frustration and the fear is that I'll have to replay the same hour of gameplay again because I couldn't find a save point in time.<br><br>This game is limited by its eternal flowing forward and its dearth of save points- while gathering items to survive, I stumbled into the next chapter of the story (chapters which you cannot go back from), leaving me to miss out on several completion criteria- and hadn't saved in a while because there are only 2 or so save stations per level.<br>I can already hear the cries of &quot;Git Gud&quot; resounding- and if you play this game, you're gonna need to- enemies kill you fast, track you down mercilessly, loiter outside doors without warning, your direction walking changes depending on where you're positioned in the building- the list goes on.<br><br>Al in all, if there was an option for a &quot;eh, play it if you have time and are bored&quot; rating, I'd give it that.

As a fan of Silent Hill I've been scrounging the depths of the horror genre, and part of my search led me to this game. At the time it was on sale (for only a couple of dollars), and I love to support indie developers and try new things, so I decided to buy it. Definitely worth the buy! Not only was this game similar in horror aspects to Silent Hill, but even the sounds of the game, map layouts, and story were very similar and did very well for the overall feel of the game. <br><br>Do not get this game if you do not enjoy puzzles, Silent Hill gameplay (extensive map checking, awkward camera angles, learning to run, etc), or sanity levels (this is a huge part of the later reaches of the game). However, if you appreciate good stories that tie into the horror aspects, a strong female protagonist, interesting NPCs, dogs (Anubis is just plain adorable!), and exploring the deep recesses of the mind then this is the game for you!<br><br>I would reach to give this game a 9\/10 because it fulfilled my horror buzz, the story was amazing, Claire and Anubis were wonderful, and the graphics (though not the best in the world) were quite appealing to me. The only point I would take away would be for the gameplay itself. It got quite hard at times because you can't fight the enemies and they constantly chase you through doors all the while your sanity meter drops you down to horrified in a second in certain areas and you lose the rest of your health because you are scared. It's very hard to get away, and Claire's stamina is not very good, so you get very slow very fast. The only other problem I had with it was the bug which, whenever you hit the accept button on the menu screen made you hit the accept button on the actual map as well. I would be hiding in a closet from an enemy, pull out my map on my menu, hit accept, and I would die because it would bring me out of the closet as well. Regardless of the criticisims this game is wonderful, and is definitely worth the buy for classic horror fans!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26447886', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26447886' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26447886\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26447886' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26447886\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26447886', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26447886_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26447886_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26398072\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mckinst87\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"46112812\">mckinst87<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI grew up on Silent Hill, the one I've replayed most is Silent Hill 2, this game is a love letter to that game.

I spotted this game on sale while it was in my queue and was intrigued. Personally, I love horror games and any that draw inspiration (whether or  not they admit to it) from titles like Silent Hill are at least worth some consideration. This game bears some similarities to that series which is usually a good thing. All in all I enjoyed my time playing Claire. I really need to sit down and finish it one of these days. Perhaps once I'm finally done with 14 hour school days. If you're reading this and considering going to college don't take more than 18 credits.

Claire is an alright game. But although I enjoyed the majority of the game, I do have some problems with it. Hopefully this will be a quick read:<br><br><u><b>Cons:<\/b><\/u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I won't go into spoilers but honestly the games storyline is mostly a <u><b>huge<\/b> mess<\/u> toward part 3\/3 of the game (\/towards the ending). The thing is that the game <i>knows<\/i> that it's storyline is confusing, and even basically says so at times. The ending clears up certain things, but there's <u><b>a lot<\/b><\/u> of &quot;<i>wut<\/i>&quot; in this game. The ending only clears up maybe 1\/10th of the things that it should've. <br><\/li><li>Things honestly become a lot less <i>scary<\/i> overtime. Especially towards the end. While the game <i>does<\/i> get more odd\/creepy down the line the fear-factor will probably eventually wane for most people.<br><\/li><li>Navigating can also be quite a bit of a mess at times. I must've checked my map over 100 times while playing this game for the 6-ish hours I played it for. It's not a huge-huge problem as the map system is pretty simple to use, it's just a tad bit annoying when you keep going in circles.<\/li><\/ul><br><u><b>Pros:<\/b><\/u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Claire has some <i>beautiful<\/i> sprites. The whole game is very pleasant to look at. Obviously there's things that <b>aren't<\/b> nice to look at, but you get what I mean. The game is very pretty. First and foremost. <br><\/li><li>The game isn't dragged out, but it's not too short either. Like Undertale the game is about 6-8 hours long. All areas are enjoyable and fun to explore.<br><\/li><li>Plenty of side-quests and extra things you can do ingame. Side-quests also <i>matter<\/i> in Claire so they're 100% worth doing. Though most consist of looking for things. <br><\/li><li>While there's no combat system you're not hopeless to enemies as well. There's plenty of ways to go about handling the majority of enemies who appear in the game.<br><\/li><li>Anubis.<\/li><\/ul><br>While I did enjoy this game more than I didn't, Claire isn't a 10\/10. Like I said, the games story can be very confusing and unmotivating at times. Most conversations you have with anybody who isn't a side-quest giving NPC are this way. <br><br>I'd personally give Claire a 7.5\/10. While it has replayability I doubt I'll be touching Claire again for at least a year, if anything. That's <b>not<\/b> saying it's a bad game though. It's an excelent 1-off game for when you're alone at night. That being said I personally don't think it's worth the $10 pricetag. If it goes on sale it's a nice pickup though.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25943661', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25943661' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25943661\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25943661' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25943661\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25943661', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25943661_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25943661_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25684473\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Moxd\/recommended\/252830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"65147830\">Moxd<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI really enjoyed this game.

She must explore the hospital in order to find out what happend. <br><br>While there aren't what I would call jump scares, the hospital environment is ominous. Claire will encounter dark 'ghosts' (not sure if that's what they are) which she can only outrun. Later when she gains her companion dog he can alert her to oncoming ghosts. There are a few puzzles to complete, and a storyline begins to emerge the further you get in this &quot;maze&quot;. Overall, its a really nice game, good amount of creepy, and has a good storyline. There are multiple endings depending on how you play, so play keeping that in mind!<br><br>There are a couple cons that were a bit infuriating; the amount of doors you have to walk through and their confusing positions. Some of them are so close its hard to figure out where at times I am going on the map. The map is mostly useful, with a couple of time it can also be confusing like the crawlspaces and mysterious floors you land on with no maps. Also, Claire has the stamina of a moridbly obese geriatric.  She'll literally run for a second and be out of breathe. Believe me, even if I was in horrendous shape, if I saw a creepy spirit following me I would find stamina from somewhere. I'm not a huge fan of stamina in games (because I like my character to run on default), but if it has to be put in to boost up the difficulty I wish it was at least more realistic. <br><br>Tl; dr Awesome simple horror game, few cons but nothing that would ruin it for me personally.
