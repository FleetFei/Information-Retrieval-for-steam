Here are some of its most prominent features to give you the gist of it:<br><br><br>PROS:<br>*High replay value due to ton of unlockables from Classes, to Companions, to Trinkets, to Weapons, to new Skills\/Spells.<br><br>*Neat turn-based battle featuring the usage of a 3 step action-point system consisting of Movement (Step 1), Utility (Step 2), and Attack (Step 3). This allows tons of combo and synergy between classes and companions!<br><br>*A dynamic world where each race is in constant conflict with their arch rivals. Picking sides will further improve relations with one but at the expense of a deteriorating relationship with the other. This will reflect in the World Map (Seafaring) where they will chase each other with their ships, and you for helping their enemies.<br>  <br>*Tons of questing variety based on the different factions you can interact with for further replay value. Numerous dialogue bubbles will emerge during your quest for you to select with differing results based on your hero class composition.<br><br>*Tons of variety from how a character looks, with a character aesthetic that grows on you, from the heroes, to companions, to npcs, to enemies.<br><br>*Despite the familiarity of the races, many of these have their own backstory and lore, unique to Overfall. These races consist of a nemesis system involving Orcs vs Forsaken, Elves vs Hollows, and Dwarves vs Goblins, with a wild card consisting of the Vorn who is the aggressor, the Undead who populate razed territories, the Everguard who are somewhat neutral, and minor factions like Pirate Ships, Merchant Ships, and Guild Ships.<br><br><br>NEUTRAL:<br>*A single play-through can be done in a relatively short time (1-3 hours). Quest are lite at best and does not have a strong narrative. This suits multiple playthroughs but does not reward players looking for a long and deep narrative.<br><br>*Buffs and Debuffs in turn-based battles are a huge part of Overfall with icons to symbolize them. Tons of strategy can be garnered from it, including combos from the stacking of buffs and debuff effects, offering greater depth. This might or might not be your cup of tea as you will need to diagnose its various status effects very often.<br><br>*Enemy AI during turn-based battles are punishing and does not hold back to ensure that the weakest link, health and defense wise comprising of your support heroes or companions are targeted with every opportunity the AI can get. Due to the rather medium to small battle layout combined with relatively high enemy movement, strategies to protect your supporters will be a challenge.<br><br>*Healing can be done at the world map by food consumption, at Inns where you can sleep and heal, and during turn-based battles in small portions via timed spells (for the most part) where healing will only commence on the next turn. You will need to plan ahead to ensure your party maintains a feasible health count before and during a battle.<br><br>*Personas which have positive or negative traits are a huge part of Overfall. Your heroes will aquire traits when you fulfil a certain requirement in-game which may completely affect your party stats either via benefiting or downright screwing your play-through to a certain degree. There is an option to remove all Personas at the Inn.<br><br>*Only two heroes can be selected at the start with extra slots for an additional two companions that will gradually join later on in the game. If both of your heroes die (permadeath) despite your companions being kept alive, the game will be instantly over. There is an option to resurrect a fallen hero, but at a cost.<br><br>*Unlockables are done from fulfilling various requirements from a mixture of hero composition, hero traits, and island types which will then trigger a questline where rewards can be unlocked once the game is over. <br><br>*The only manual control you will get (apart from combat) is via the world map where you control your very own ship. Upon landing on one of the many islands, a quest will ensue which happens via fade-in and fade-out sequences as it changes scenery from one location to the next. While this is somewhat linear, it will fare well for creators to contribute their questlines to the Steam Workshop.<br><br><br>CONS:<br>*The map layout consist of randomly generated islands within a simple sea setting. Despite the heavy reliance of seafaring, the boat you are in is non upgradable and is merely used as a vessel for transportation between islands. While this is not its strong suit, it can be understood due to practicality purposes.<br><br>*You will constantly be in a race against time as the Vorn (Antagonist) increase in forces while you rally a racial faction under your banner via doing quest. Things will get a little hectic and the world dynamism will be heavily skewed in the Vorns favor if you let the timer run its course.<br><br>*Shop offers only basic upgrades in the form of upgradable skills and buffs. There are no buying of equipment. (The only way you will be able to change weapons, trinkets, and skillsets is by unlocking it in your play-through and selecting it from the character creation menu when you begin anew).<br><br>*You are unable to customize the way your hero looks. You can however rename them.<br><br><br>It is pivotal to take note that I heartily enjoyed Overfall, including those under &quot;Neutral&quot; and would definitely recommend it. However, I do feel it is important to list these prominent features down so one could make an informed purchasing decision based on their sole preferences.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23053794', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23053794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23053794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23053794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23053794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23053794', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23053794_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23053794_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t55 of 59 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22343887\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">Faudraline<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/games\/?tab=all\">1,610 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>From a single thread, many destinies are woven.<\/b><br><br>To begin with, I'd like to dully note that I'm not really a fan of the rogue-like genre. In all RPGs, I'd very much prefer being able to save my progress, 'cause I mainly play these kind of games for the story and the high probability of losing all my progress to a silly mistake that I may make in any given time is pure dread to me. But I'll make an exception and recommend a rogue-like today, considering it's story-driven part has overcome all my distaste towards the genre. <i>Overfall<\/i>, and everything that this game may offer are wondrously intriguing and fully enriched with countless things to stumble upon and discover.<br><br>As there would be a beginning to any story, our story begins with an old war. As the human armies manage to claim their utmost victory against orcish hordes - don't worry, this won't turn out to be the millionth orcs vs. humans tale - the wise Everking foresees a greater threat in the threads of future. He summons two heroes to his citadel and sends them on a quest to a foreign realm inhabited by the Vorn, a nation of ruthless barbarians. As ordered from them, these heroes overcome the challenges of the realm and steal the Disc of Ages, an odd artifact with immense power and questionable origins. As they manage to steal the artifact and go back to their native realm, hordes of Vorn follow them to retrieve the artifact at all costs. As if all this chaos is not enough, our heroes find their native realm in turmoil, ravaged by the endless war between other inhabitants of the realm: dwarves, orcs, elves, goblins, hollows and the forsaken. As informed by a messenger of the oracle Ezel, we are to take on a quest to prove ourselves to the leaders of this realm, gaining favor from their races. Only then, may we find the Everking and put an end to the Vorn invasion.<br><br><b>The tides are rising... They are coming.<\/b><br><br>Phew, as you can see we don't have a scarcity of action in this tale. Lots to do, to discover, to wage war for and claim. Let's take a closer look on the game dynamics though. As I have stated before, <i>Overfall<\/i> is a rogue-like RPG. If your party is to perish during combat, you start a new game. But with each playthrough, you possibly unlock a series of other upgrades, various companions and talents which could be chosen during your new playthroughs. We take the role of two heroes - a fighter and a cleric as we start, but there are many other unlockable classes to pick as we progress - and lead them in their journey. We travel with a ship and visit different islands or cross paths with other ships which will all contain various well-written random encounters that we may pursue with either diplomacy or pure combat. Through these encounters, we collect heroes, allies, materials, abilities; and progress our main story by choosing a side in this conflict of many nations. As time passes, the Vorn invasion takes a progress also, changing the tone and the difficulty of the travelling map equally.<br><br>Display options are incredibly good with countless unique cartoonish character designs and beautifully arranged background arts. The introduction cinematic is a triumphant beauty with ink swirl art and strong narrative depiction. As we rarely stumble on the rogue-genre, the whole world is living and it is more than possible to discover an encounter that you are yet to see in your 20th playthrough or even furthermore. All encounters that you may pursue carry well written script and appropriate choice options to deal with given problems. The subtext of most encounters are weaved out of both humorous and fitting homages to the fantasy genre itself.<br><br>I wouldn't know much about an appropriate rogue-like gameplay, but RPG options are better than most RPG games out there; both with encounter variety and character ability customization through unlockables. Your characters will gain random treats that will affect their abilities through their experiences, yet using your environment and choosing your battles carry utmost importance for any encounter you may stumble upon. Dying is a natural part of the game, and it's fine as you may use all unlocked abilities in a new playthrough anyhow. The default difficulty has been a tad bit cruel for my own gaming abilities, so I'm glad that there has been a recent patch to arrange difficulty. Now I can actually play the game and enjoy the story with an easy mode!<br><br>I've been following this one from Early Access and I'm not usually in favor of promoting those since you'd never know if it would actually worth it, but the attentiveness of the developer crew has been not only promising, it's briefly exalted! The game gets a minor update here and there nearly every day; and a major one once in a week to either add a new option or improve gameplay with countless fixes. Their reply rate in the community and their manner of addressing every little detail gracefully are all welcoming changes in this market. I strongly hope <i>Overfall<\/i> to get a lasting place among all-time favorites of all roguelike and RPG lovers alike! This is a journey worthy of taking any day!<br><br><b>Disclosure: A key has been provided by the developer for the purpose of this review.<\/b><br><br>Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/ladystoryteller#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a> - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22343887', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22343887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22343887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22343887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22343887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22343887', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22343887_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22343887_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22337026\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">El Kemosabe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,218 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Overfall was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Another Human\/Orc settlement needs your assistance! <\/div><br>Overfall is a story-driven rogue-like with turn-based combat from developers, Pera Games. You play as two adventurers who have been stuck in a mysterious portal for three centuries. A lot has changed in three centuries and you now face a world being ravaged by a faction called the Vorn. This group of experienced and ruthless raiders are not only incredibly dangerous, they are expanding incredibly quickly and it is up to you stop them!<br><br>Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.<br><br>As you can see from the store page, Overfall is a good looking game (and it\u2019ll only ever look that good since the game\u2019s graphics settings are limited to resolution). The combat animations are all very good as well, sometimes they felt a little over-the-top but nothing too bad. However, Overfall\u2019s audio is currently a bit hit and miss. This is because, while the sound effects are great, there quite a few actions which do not have sound effects. Again, it\u2019s not a huge issue and I imagine they\u2019ll be added in later since it is an Early Access game but I did find it a little jarring when some characters\/actions made sounds and others didn\u2019t in combat.<br><br>Your goal in Overfall is to stop the Vorn. As you\u2019d imagine, you\u2019re not going to be able to stop a huge faction of raiders on your own, you\u2019re going to have to help the game\u2019s other factions to gain their support. The other factions are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Humans <br><\/li><li>Orcs<br><\/li><li>Everguards <br><\/li><li>Goblins<br><\/li><li>Elves<br><\/li><li>Dwarves<br><\/li><li>Forsaken<br><\/li><li>Hollow<\/li><\/ul>Improving your relationship with these factions high enough will make them view you as a friend\/ally and so they\u2019ll help you with your mission by giving you any resources you need when you visit their homeland. These missions generally entail helping the factions with issues in their settlements. Since most islands are home to two factions, such as Human\/Orc, many of these missions have something to do with decreasing the tension between the two factions. You travel between the islands on your boat and as you travel, time passes. As time passes the game\u2019s \u2018doomsday clock\u2019 progresses, meaning the Vorn grow in strength until they eventually win, unless you stop them of course.<br><br>Your relationships with the game\u2019s factions are improved by completing missions which help someone from one of the factions. Completing missions will also increase your worldwide recognition. As well as the Vorn, you are also unable to improve your relationship with Humans or the Everguards. Humans are always friendly and will still give you missions whereas the Everguards are more of an enemy faction, you can choose dialogue options to avoid fighting them but they aren\u2019t the most likeable faction going so you\u2019re probably going to want to kill them all! Once you\u2019ve completed enough missions you\u2019ll have high enough recognition to recruit up to two adventurers to help you in combat. Adventurers can be found all over the world and will ask to travel with you once you complete the missions associated with them. If you have a slot available, you can recruit them then but if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t worry! You can find adventurer ships travelling around which will allow you to recruit any of the adventurers you\u2019ve found before (even from previous runs). <br><br>Staying with unlocks, there are also main character classes, weapons, utility skills and trinkets to unlock. New classes are unlocked in a similar way to adventurers, you\u2019ll come across a special mission where (from my experience) you will fight alongside the character with the class and when you win the fight they will be unlocked for any subsequent runs. As for weapons, skills and trinkets, I haven\u2019t found any myself just yet but they are unlocked through completing special missions with very specific unlock requirements. New weapons come with new offensive skills, utility skills should be self-explanatory and new trinkets grant you certain bonuses such as \u201cWeapon attacks have a 15% chance to heal self by 3\u201d.<br><br>Combat has three different phases: the movement phase; the utility phase and the combat phase (in that order). As it stands, once you end a phase you cannot return to the previous phase, <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/402310\/discussions\/1\/365163686058767779\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >however the developers are working on adding a way to return to the previous phase if you end it accidentally. <\/a>In the movement phase, you can either move normally or use your character\u2019s special move ability (with a two turn cooldown). These vary from character to character but they range from a massive leap dealing damage to adjacent enemies to leaving a healing aura on adjacent tiles while you walk to heal allies. The utility phase lets you use your class-specific skills. These skills are mainly focused on applying buffs to allies\/yourself or applying debuffs to enemies but there are some skills that do other things too. The combat phase is where the real action happens, you can use your weapon-specific attacks to deal damage to your enemies. Melee focused classes can generally only attack targets adjacent to them but magic\/ranged focused classes can attack from afar. One thing I will say, combat is tough as nails to begin with. Early on in a run you\u2019ll want to avoid combat for the most part as pretty much anything can kill you, don\u2019t pick fights you can\u2019t win because believe me, you will die.<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, Overfall is actually a story-driven game, surprising for a rogue-like. You\u2019d think this would have an impact on replay value but the game has two key features which, when considered with the game\u2019s unlocks, mean the game does have a fair amount of replayability. First of all, your two main characters have special dialogue options during some conversations. Choosing one of these will make a difference to how the story plays out, even choosing different \u2018normal\u2019 dialogue will change how the story plays out. While these options aren\u2019t enough to create an entirely new story, there\u2019s enough variation (especially once you start playing with new classes) to prevent them from being tedious when you encounter them again. The stories themselves are generally very good though I did notice quite a few grammatical\/spelling errors in the writing, not a huge issue but something worth mentioning. The other feature which helps keep things fresh is a built-in Story Builder with workshop support. This allows players to create and share their own quests which can be added to the game to supplement the quests already there. I haven\u2019t played around with it too much but it does have a tutorial to help you get started and it does look reasonably straightforward to use.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict <\/div><br>With interesting stories, excellent turn-based combat, lots to unlock and great aesthetics, Overfall is a thoroughly enjoyable story-driven rogue-like.<br><br><i><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/lonerangerreviews#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Lone Ranger Reviews.<\/a><\/i><br><br>El K.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22337026', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22337026' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22337026\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22337026' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22337026\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22337026', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22337026_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22337026_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21655011\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">Zorder<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/games\/?tab=all\">2,516 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/\">179 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Overfall on March 5, 2016, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Open world fantasy RPG<\/div><br><b>Overfall<\/b> is an open world fantasy RPG that was successfully funded on Kickstarter. It has a turn-based combat with a focus on party encounters. The game features over a hundred different locations and dozens of NPCs, party companions and enemies.<br><br>The game starts off with a small introduction and after creating your two starting characters you are tossed back into the world. The story is pretty simple, you were sent on a quest to another world by your king and while you were there, centuries passed on your homeworld, while to you it was only a few days. Now, on your return, you find out that your king has gone missing and that your world is in chaos with various factions fighting for control and supremacy.<br><br>On your quest you\u2019ll be traveling by boat from island to island and you can board any ship you find at sea, and they will react to you depending on your reputation with said faction. During dialogue you can choose to either trade, attack or persuade the enemy.<br><br>Combat will feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played any turn based tactical RPG. However, instead of having a certain number of moves per unit, Overfall arranges the combat in an interesting way. Each turn is divided into different phases: movement, utility and attack. During the Movement phase you can either move your character or use a special move ability such as leaping to get closer to your foes. On the Utility phase you can use abilities that don\u2019t directly damage your enemies but still affect them in some way such as stunning or bleeding. On the last phase you get your chance to use offensive abilities to actually make some real damage to your enemies. I find this combat scheme to work rather well and it opens up many tactical opportunities.<br><br>Some characters that you find on islands or ships will let you know about certain events, such as humans that require assistance on an island. Completing tasks such as these will raise or lower your reputation with the various factions. The thing about these random quests is that they are not linear, you can either attack the other party straight up or you can try talking your way out of a fight.<br><br>Completing these random events will reward with either reputation or one of the four resources that are in the game. You have Food which is used to heal party members, Dust which is used to upgrade Utility Skills or increase the speed of your ship, Rune that is used to ressurrect or hire new companions and Frag which is the currency in the game. Completing quests is necessary to upgrade your weapons and make your party stronger.<br><br><b><u>Pros:<\/u><\/b><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simple yet challenging combat<br><\/li><li>Story creator, which creates the possibility of infinite replayability<br><\/li><li>Gorgeous art style with beautiful backgrounds and some neat particle effects<br><\/li><li>Great and moody soundtrack<br><\/li><li>9 different classes with full customization of skills, trinkets and weapons. You only start with a few, and it is fun to unlock more along the way<br><\/li><li>Feels pretty complete for an early access game<br><\/li><li>Reputation system with six different factions: Orcs, Elvest, Dwarves, Goblins, Hollows and Forsaken<\/li><\/ul><br><b><u>Neutral:<\/u><\/b><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Permanent death, once you lose a character they are gone for good. If you lose all characters you have to restart into a new world. While I think that this will appeal to a lot of people, I feel like having the option to continue a previous world would be nice for players that don\u2019t like permadeath<\/li><\/ul><br><b><u>Cons:<\/u><\/b><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I feel like there are some balancing issues. You might end up running into a combat scene early on the game which you can\u2019t beat but still, I guess this is reminiscent of the \u201croguelike genre\u201d<br><\/li><li>Some attacks\/abilities have no sound effect but I figure this will be \u201cfixed\u201d on the final release version<br><\/li><li>No way to check what a certain buff or debuff actually does before using a specific skill. You\u2019re only able to tell what each buff or debuff actually does after applying it, which will show a small icon above the character and if you move the mouse cursor over it you can see a small description of that status.<\/li><\/ul><br><b>Overall thoughts:<\/b><br><br>Overfall is a great game and I was really surprised by it. The game by itself has a story mode with random encounters and several different classes and skills to choose from which makes the game perfect for multiple playthroughs. Not only that but the Story Creator only adds up to the replayability, even if you don\u2019t fancy writing your own story to play, you can still check other peoples stories and download them on the Steam workshop. The combat is simple and easy to understand but yet, it requires thinking. Overfall plays great, feels great and runs great! Other than what I mentioned above, I believe I have no other complaints to make at the moment and I highly recommend this game to any fans of turn based combat RPGs or to people who are looking for a very replayable game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21655011', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21655011' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21655011\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21655011' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21655011\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21655011', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21655011_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21655011_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21768985\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"81089627\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d3\/d3d086a27333e8fd796ab579eba7fbee068d06b8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d3\/d3d086a27333e8fd796ab579eba7fbee068d06b8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d3\/d3d086a27333e8fd796ab579eba7fbee068d06b8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/\" data-miniprofile=\"81089627\">Another Persona<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/games\/?tab=all\">170 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anotherpersona\/recommended\/402310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">60.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Overfall was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a great rogue-like with very interesting tactical combat. The story is solid. The dialogue is often quite hilarious and witty. Exploring islands is a lot of fun, and when you have died and started again.. and you run into an identical situation... it does not go as planned. Love that. Pretty refreshing.<br><br>The learning curve and advancement is also a lot of fun, some battles in the early game you must simply avoid (I got pwned so hard by running into a ship, on purpose, after only visiting two islands; 4 pirates vs a Cleric and a Fighter = doomed). The combat is so much fun with the bad-azz music that seems to crescendo at the right times. Awesome spell animations\/fight animations. Great art-style.<br><br>It's a great game with an active dev and consistent updates. \u2665\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

A code was provided by the developer for review purposes.<br><br>Overfall is a fantasy RPG roguelike game that sees two heroes begin a quest to save their king. They have just come back from stealing loot from the Vorm, but forgot to close the portal behind them, allowing an army of Vikings right into their kingdom through the backdoor. Your task throughout Overfall is to amass an army big enough to push them back through the portal that they came through.<br><br>At the start of the game, you are allowed to choose two heroes. Only two classes will be available at the start, warrior and cleric. Throughout the game you will unlock new classes to use on your adventure. There are 9 playable characters in total, with 36 combat companions to find. The game is completely non-linear \u2013 right from the start of the game you choose exactly where to go and when. You navigate around the world using a boat, sailing between islands which have unique events, quests and enemies to explorer. Everything in this game is completely procedurally generated, so much that anything can change depending on the make up or your party or depending on what actions you took in previous events. The aim of the game is to raise your reputation with enough different factions and races in the world to be able to band together with said factions and races to push back the Vorm army. Raising your reputation with these factions can be done either by completing quests, killing the races\u2019 arch enemy in battle, or following through different random events throughout the world.<br><br>Overfall\u2019s combat system is one of the game\u2019s flagship features. The turn based hex based combat system is extremely in-depth, but not so complex that you can\u2019t pick this game up and start playing immediately. Although the game doesn\u2019t have much of a tutorial system, you soon are able to pick up how to play the game to its full potential. Each character has three phases to their turn, a movement phase, utility phase and attack phase. The utility phase and attack phase is where most of the tactical advances are made. You are able to create combos between your party member\u2019s different attacks. The game has a very strong emphasis on status effects, and boy is there a lot of status effects.  Almost every action apart from your regular movement will cause either a positive status effect or a negative effect. How you combat these effects is completely dependent on how well your tactical knowledge of the game has become.<br><br>Graphically Overfall uses a unique art style, with all of the characters having a bobble head look to them, with some really detailed cartoon graphics along with them. All of the characters have their own interesting look as well as some nicely animated movement and attacks. The environments throughout the world are all diversely created that allows for different weather effects dependant on what type of island you have found yourself on, from snowstorms on mountains, to sand storms in the desert.  The sound effects are a little to be questioned about though; the majority of the effects are there and done to a high standard, but I did come across times when there was just missing sound effects. This detracted me from the immersion of the title and were a little off-putting a times unfortunately.  The soundtrack is definitely something this game should be proud of though. It is so beautifully put together with different instruments such as violins and harps. Combined they make a classical soundtrack that adds to the game\u2019s atmosphere which almost makes up for the missing sound effect issues.  <br><br>A good rogue-like has plenty of replay ability, Overfall is no different. Whilst the game does feature perma death for your characters, your failed runs aren\u2019t for nothing as you will end up unlocking different abilities, weapons and characters to use on future runs. This is what makes the difference between a good roguelike- and an amazing roguelike. It gives you another reason to keep playing after you fail. You will more than likely die a lot to begin with, as the opponent\u2019s AI is extremely well tuned to add a sufficient amount of difficulty. Although the game play can sometimes feel repetitive, you are able to change your characters around so much at the start of a run, that you can get a completely different feel to the gameplay quite easily after you\u2019ve unlocked a few extra options. <br><br>Other than the missing sound effects problem, I didn\u2019t really have any other technical problems. I would have liked to of seen controller support included as this sort of game really benefits from being able to use a controller and sitting back in your chair but you can\u2019t have everything I suppose. The game supports most high end resolutions but sadly not up to 4k. There aren\u2019t any graphical options as hopefully this game should run at a steady 60 fps regardless of what setup you are running.<br><br>Overall I am absolutely having a blast with my time in Overfall, the game\u2019s unique art style, and highly addictive nature of the gameplay just keeps making me want to jump in for another run here and there. The high replay factor will also swing this game into more people\u2019s libraries as you can quite easily rack up twenty hours of gameplay before anything starts to become too stale. The game is perfectly priced as well; some may even consider it too cheap for the high production values on offer here!<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23039452', 'summary' );
