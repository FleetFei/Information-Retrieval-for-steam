The game features a long campaign with a substantial tech tree for eight soldier classes, with sub specialisations within these making a big difference on your playing style. Graphic are simple, but do not be decieved by the humble looks, beneath the surface is hours of fun! The game can be played on easy mode for a learning first run, but can be run up through quite a few difficulty levels that makes it a very tough beast to beat, with the highest one allowing no reruns of missions that go wrong and permadeath of squad members makes your tactics... change. :)<br><br>The story of the game will entice and please lovers of old school scifi, the most obvious source of inspiration being Frank Herbert's Dune.

I managed to make it through 2 of the levels without losing any pilots. I was racking up XP and RP and researching my Scout's heavy weapons.<br><br>And then ... disaster struck. It was supposed to be a standard sweep of some dusty mining town, a place called Tundeer. We deployed north of the gates, took out a few Xeno and thought we were ready.<br><br>We couldn't find any of the Faction colonists, but the place was crawling with Xenos. It didn't take them long either, to figure out we were there. The hit us hard, from the west. Scout Brianna had the taken the high ground and the Hunters came in from the ridge to her left. We'd swept it and didn't spot the spawning tunnels. In an instant, Brianna's mech was surrounded. The Warrior's Wrath boost got the Captain back to the ridgeline in two turns ... but by then it was over. Brianna was dead, her tank torn to pieces.<br><br>We cleared Tundeer. We even saved a few of the colonists. But none of us could forget Brianna ... <br><br>So far I like this game. One of the stand out features is the ability to undo the spending of XP at any time with the &quot;Respec&quot; button. Gear does not cost Gold so you can configure and reconfigure each character whenever you want. Don't like that build? Re-design and try again! Game was made by science fiction fans, I'm glad to see hints in the lore about Star Traders 4X too!<br><br>*** Full Disclosure: I am a long time fan of the developer and was part of the Alpha Testing team for Battleforce. I also backed them on Kickstarter for one of their other Steam games. I would recommend buying this game just based on the customer service but I did really enjoy playing it before it came out on Steam. ***\t\t\t\t\t<div

be honest.<br><br>I've only written one to date but this game deserves some attention.<br><br>I was very reluctant to purchase this game at first because there has just been so much low budget stuff on steam of late but because I had a little change in my wallet and the fact the game is priced correctly I decided to give it a go.<br><br>I have to say I am more than delighted with my purchase.<br><br>Trese Brothers have done a fantastic job, both with the game and with their community interaction.<br><br>They are a credit to game development and how dlc and support of a game should be managed.<br><br>The big guns out there, could learn a thing or two from these guys.<br><br>I won't go into the story or key features here as you can read all that from the game store page but I will say that the features they list are correct and the game does what it says.<br><br>The squad customization is truly inspiring, if a little daunting at first. <br>What I mean by that is, you don't have AAA graphics here so the tons of equipment and various skills and talents throw lots of numbers at you instead, which can be the daunting part.<br>However, given a little time and some missions into the game you start to come to terms with it all and then you can't help but want to play more missions to earn more RP to get that new piece of equipment or unlock that new Templar type.<br><br>What I like most about building your Templars though, is the fact that you really feel the difference in the changes you make. <br>A lot of games fail in that regard, you get excited about a new piece of kit or a skill and it proves totally underwhelming in actual combat. Not so here. <br>You get a new sword and all of a sudden you're single hit killing those low level Xeno's that used to need two hits. <br>Crowd control is a thing, and now your Templars are ready for it!<br><br>I feel the game also does a good job of satisfying the needs of players who like varying skill levels. I often see the arguments about casual and hardcore gamers now, well to me all games should be capable of supporting both by the use of difficulty levels. <br>Trese Brothers have added many difficulty options to suit all players and each level has a good description of what it actually does so the player isn't left guessing and trying to figure it out themselves (Yet another thing the Brothers should be commended on).<br><br>The game does so much right and the Trese Brothers really have poured love and affection into their game and will continue to do so (for Free, I might add).<br><br>*Edit: All of the below minor complaints from me have been patched and fixed and the devs continue to update the game. Brilliant devs and they deserve huge credit for everything they do.*<br><br>The very few minor things I disliked or found confusing about the game are already being responded to and were the majority have voiced an opinion are being changed.<br><br>Things like the speed of text during cutscenes, I'm slowing down in my old age and I find I am having to rush to read which breaks immersion of the story for me. It confused me because during missions you have to click to forward text and I felt this should be the same for cutscene text.<br><br>During the starting missions of the game, before you really know what is going on, you are asked to activate a gate but the switch you use to do this just looks like any other map flavour tile and the fact you can click on it is not immediately obvious. <br>I lost a few turns here, while thinking to myself, Alright I'm in the area you told me to go to, why isn't something happening? Because you didn't click the switch dumbass. Well it wasn't really that obvious game :D<br><br>The open and closed deployment before going into a mission confused me because whenever it said open I was clicking furiously around the screen for some way to take the Templars I wanted into the mission. <br>Before I finally went to the forums and read that 'open' means you can get a control point in the mission which will allow you to call in more Templars as opposed to actually allowing you to take what you want from the beginning. <br>And closed meant there would be no control point and what you get is what you have for the full mission. (This is something the devs are addressing and will be updated to allow you to take what Templars you want outside of what is actually needed for the scenario, like an engineer or scout etc).<br><br>Lastly the fact you left click on an enemy to see their stats but also left click on an enemy to attack them. <br>In the later missions of the game it is important to watch your Templars heat and balance moving, damage and other various skills. <br>So I often want to check the health left on an enemy to be sure I can kill it in another way before taking a shot with the same Templar again. <br>The current system can lead to mistakenly taking shots or using a skill you did not want to. <br>You can unselect your Templar or their skill before clicking on an enemy to avoid this but I feel it is a little clunky and could do with being changed.<br><br>As I said, these things are already been looked into by the Trese Brothers and overall I think they did an amazing job with this game.<br><br>I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves Turn based strategy and squad building games and if you are new to the series and just dipping your toe in I couldn't fault you starting here.<br><br>Well worth a purchase.<br><br>I hope when the Trese Brothers grow into producing AAA titles they remain true to their current values and continue to price their games correctly and support them as they do now.<br><br>Thank you Trese Brothers.<br><br>I look forward to what I hope will be a very long and bright future for you in video games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18182149', 'summary' );

squad tactical grid combat game, with a focus on defending or advancing through swarms of enemies while completing objectives via set scenarios. It shares common ground with other squad tactics games like Xcom and the more recent Warhammer 40K Space Hulk games. It adds its own spin on progression by blending table top RPG attributes, light tech tree management and weapon\/gear loadouts to give it its own unique tone and feel.<br><br>Combat is quick and challenging, often you can kill a enemy in 1 turn but if you aren't careful they can do the same. It's important to have each member of your squad cover and support one another, because if any single member is left exposed they will quickly be overwhelmed. At the end of the day CROWD CONTROL is the name of the game, you are also often playing AGAINST THE CLOCK. You are encouraged to race through and complete each scenario as fast as possible. If you stay put and try to bide your time you will usually lose by attrition and get overwhelmed. By this same token exploration can be a double edged sword where exploring the map might uncover bonus experience or a cache, but you might stretch your characters too thin and risk becoming too weak to finish your objective. Buffs and enhancements have limited use so you need to use them with some finesse, this also ties into the pressure to speed through the level in as few turns as possible.<br><br>The combat turn is free forming where your characters can do any action in any order you wish. The characters don't have to complete all of their actions before selecting the next character. There is no turn order. For example: your soldier can shoot someone, then have your captain buff the squad, then go back to your soldier to setup overwatch, then have your captain push ahead all on the same turn.<br><br>Another wrinkle to combat is there are forward points or &quot;Tactical Points&quot; that you can capture and control on the map. You use these as staging areas; they generate currency over time you can use to resupply, deploy extra squad members and give your squad bonuses. You will often feel compelled to protect these &quot;Tactical Points,&quot; especially since the enemy can destroy and capture them too. Maintaining these points can be critical in some levels. However in other levels the Tactical Points can be a misleading lure; slowing your game down where you get caught up in standing off against the enemy when you should instead be pushing ahead. Caught up in a struggle over Tactical Points will cause you to lose momentum and eventually lose to attrition as many levels will have unlimited enemies.<br><br>Another thing to be wary of is that while many of the enemy spawn points are marked and easy to identify, many others are much more subtle and not so easy to identify, this can lead to some frustrating moments (especially at higher difficulties) as spawning enemies can freely move and attack on the same turn that they appear. This can compounded by squad members' short line of sight. Members that can counter act this with the &quot;Sensorkit Scan&quot; will be invaluable.<br><br>Death on lower difficulties will give you back your characters after you finish the level, but on higher difficulties death is permanent. The game is very different depending on the difficulty setting you chose: on low to medium difficulty the game is more akin to a Sci-fi RPG with a core party you can rely on regardless of what happens. At higher difficulties you get more of a Xcom experience where you have to live through the loss of your veteran members killed in action.<br><br>Progression is handled in a split of traditional skills and attributes, a branching tech tree, as well as weapon\/armor\/augment loadout you take into battle. You can respec your squad skills without detriment. With unlimited respecs you can adjust to whatever scenario the game throws at you and experiment without the worry of being stuck with skills you dislike. There is some light customization with color swap, portrait swap and renaming your characters, but it is not very in depth. Some more options and perhaps different graphics for the more robust armor and weapons would help give the characters a little more distinction and personality.<br><br>The story is serviceable but not very robust which is understandable for a squad tactical game. The focus of the game is the combat and how you handle yourself in battle. Most of the plot and background development will happen through cut scenes, monologues, dialog trees and discussions with fellow crew at headquarters. I actually hope more plot, origins and history of Shalun will be added in future updates to flesh out this games plot ties with the other Star Trader games a little more. <br><br>The UI is easy to understand and most things are clean and well explained.There are useful tool tips for most elements in the game. However I do feel some key information ought to be included in the tool tips such as remaining AP\/MP and perhaps armor and deflection. Toggles for animation speed, and more general game options would be welcome additions too.<br><br>Music ambiance is decent, some tunes are catchy and capture the mood or situation, but some tracks seem cut short and can become weary after several plays. Sound effects are also serviceable but nothing amazing. <br><br>In Summary:<br>Overhead Squad Tactical Grid Scenario Combat Game with some twists and a unique approach to progression.<br>Fight as a Templar Captain in part of the Star Traders universe taking flavor from Dune, Space Hulk, and some Hindu. <br>PRO<br>Simple and challenging combat that is easy to pickup and play.<br>Lots of scenarios, varied difficulty settings, and an ever growing list of content (due to updates) help give the game long legs and high replayability.<br>Great overwatch mechanic that is tactical without destroying balance.<br>The devs are very involved and receptive to community feedback and the game is always improving as a result.<br>CON<br>Characters could use some more customization to make each member feel more like your own.<br>Very little game options to tailor your preferences.<br>Music and sound effects are serviceable but could still be better, particularly music loops could be longer and more varied.<br>Some enemy spawn locations are hard to make out leading to frustrating moments.<br>Many levels require a &quot;core&quot; set of classes and don't leave much room to experiment with the less used classes. Edit: Devs have added a swap out member mechanic which does help this a bit.<br>OTHER<br>The Tutorial levels can drag a bit and do a bit of hand holding, I'd suggest playing through it just once for the plot points or to get the basics down and then skipping ahead to the main game from there. <br>The setting is akin to Space Hulk but has it own subtle spin and ties into the other Star Traders games from a Templar prospective, I hope more plot and Star Trader history is added in future updates.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18321419', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18321419' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18321419\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18321419' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18321419\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18321419', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18321419_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18321419_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/recommended\/370020\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22822713\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"34238189\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d4945c8dbc02f1a67d24352d1d3fc95641eaac0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d4945c8dbc02f1a67d24352d1d3fc95641eaac0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d4945c8dbc02f1a67d24352d1d3fc95641eaac0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/\" data-miniprofile=\"34238189\">JDCollie<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/games\/?tab=all\">780 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/recommended\/\">33 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994503917\/recommended\/370020\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolutely phenomenal turn based combat game. Templar Battleforce is a love letter to games like Space Hulk and the early days of X-COM. <br><br>You play as a group of superhuman, genetically enhanced warriors who are protecting a newly colonized section of a vast interstellar empire. Imbued with the ancestoral memories of your templar ancestors, it is your duty to beat back the unreleting hordes (and they really are hordes) of Xenos scum looking to make a meal of you.<br><br>Gameplay consists of top-down, turn based combat. You command a small squad of templars in a manner very similar to the original X-COM. Unlike your crysalid-bait rookies, (and more like Space Hulk) your templars have tremendously powerful skills and infinite ammo. The downside is that both abilities and weapons generate heat, as does movement, forcing you to pick which targets to kill, but to decide when as well. Overwatching a bridge swarming with xenos may provide excellent fire support, but the resulting weaponsfire may also overheat your critically toatsy templar.<br><br>Also like Space Hulk, you are always completely and totally outnumbered in Templars Battleforce. Enemy reinforcements are infinite, and many battles are fighting advances or retreats against mounting waves of foes. This makes for some surprisingly intense combat, and will definitely give your grey matter a workout. Do you split your forces into two advancing teams to get to the objectives faster? Do you leave one behind at the beacon to wait for your own reinforcements?

I usually like turn by turn strategy and tactical games like civilization, fire emblem, shining force, ...<br><br>Templar Batteleforce is a tactical rpg type game which is mostly a sequence of fights with team building in between fights; in the same way your typical fire emblem would be. <br><br>It took me about 40 hours to beat the game for the first time which makes the game an appropriate length in my opinion. It is about 40-ish battles. The game features many difficulty level and probably has a reasonnable replay value. I plan on at least playing the full game a second time, and probably more to explore different team builds.<br><br>What really did the game for me is how battles are constructed. Essentially the better you &quot;score&quot; in a battle, the more experience and RP (essentially money) you get out of the battle. The score is essentially computed depending on how fast you accomplished the objectives, how many ennemie you killed and how many secondary objective (often unknown to you in advance) you accomplished. This gives a sense of urgency in the battles, encourages you to explore, but exploring is dangerous.<br><br>An interesting mechanic in the game is the concept of &quot;heat points&quot;. Essentially all movement and action a character does makes its suit heat. And when overheated, he starts taking damage, losing ability to perform some types of action, or completely shut down. It is something that usually does not come in the way too much, but it is also something that you can not ignore.<br><br>The team build part of the game is interesting. Essentially the number of &quot;points&quot; you can allocate to characters really mean that you can not max-out a character. You have to make hard choices. For instance, you pretty much have to choose between a scout that can scan large portion of the maps and move fast, and a scout that deals massive damage at a distance; you can try a middle ground but it might not be best. Similarly with the engineer, either you get a tact point expert to help take and control tactical points (which are supply point on the map), or you make a battle engineer which buffs your units and is reasonnably useful in a fight. Doing both is a possible but serious compromise,<br><br>One of the problem I have with the team building is that the UI is a bit awkward and it took me almost an entire run through the game before I had a clear enough understanding of the game mechanics to optimize my team carefully. There are a few dimensions to the game system (roll to hit, damage reduction, peircing damage ignore part of the armor, bio-damage do damage in the long run, ...) which are all pretty much independent in the character sheet. It is sometimes hard to see how much point to spend in one aspect. Fortunately, you can &quot;respec&quot; your units from scratch between battles, so if you misunderstood the impact of a game mechanic, you can correct your team building mistakes for the next battle.<br><br>In term of difficulty, there are many difficulty levels. I play a lot of tactical games and normal was too easy for me. If you are used to that kind of games, push it one notch up. Though, it seems that at higher level, there is perma death, so... be careful.<br><br>I really liked some of the options in the game. Soldiers can use &quot;overwatch&quot; to cover some squares of the map and shoot enemie entering the zone. hydras can use napalm to set some squares of the map on fire causing damage to units passing through. Engineers can build turrets to defend some parts of the map. So overall, I feel like as a player, your decision can shape how the skirmish unfols.<br><br>One thing that could be annoying is that the ennemies can pop out of many places with no way for you to know in advance, and they usually play in the turn they appear. So you can get in situation where a unit pops out and deals you damage without much you could have done. (overwatch can be useful there.)<br><br>I find that the units you control have a very limitted field of vision. And sometimes, this can be very annoying.<br><br>Something good is that the game developpers are quite responsive. I don't know how long they will be maintaining the game. But for now, they reply on the forum almost immediately. I pointed out a bug that was essentially fixed in a day. They take suggestion.<br><br>The storyline is pretty much irrelevant. I do not feel like you have a clear control of the story nor a clear idea of the lore of the game. It is a fairly straight forward story, with a bit of details if you want to know more. Clearly the story is not the focus of the game. Overall, I feel like it is appropriate for this type of game.<br><br>The graphics are alright. It is a seen from atop game. Nothing fancy, but it works. The graphic style is nice and enjoyable. I appreciated the fact that the style is overall coherent, many smaller games tend to have incoherency in style. But this one is profesionnal.<br><br>In term of sounds, the sfx are appropriate, but the background music sucks. The music is really subpar in this game. One of the track is pretty much a mix of a 8-second track with a 16-second track. The others are not much better. It drove my wife crazy. Fortunately, you can shut the music off and leave the sfx, and play your own music in the back. Makes the game much more enjoyable.<br><br>In summary, is this game perfect ? no. Is it the best tactical game out there? no. Is it fun and enjoyable? Yes. Is it worth its price? Absolutely.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23840402', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23840402' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23840402\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23840402' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23840402\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23840402', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23840402_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23840402_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18654317\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/whitekitten\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"3014349\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31dc5ca4a90a7b03bbc47b1bc8487a0b14585352.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31dc5ca4a90a7b03bbc47b1bc8487a0b14585352.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31dc5ca4a90a7b03bbc47b1bc8487a0b14585352_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/whitekitten\/\" data-miniprofile=\"3014349\">Jewel<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/whitekitten\/games\/?tab=all\">214 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/whitekitten\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/whitekitten\/recommended\/370020\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love this game. Have thoroughly enjoyed playing 23+ hours so far and I think I'm about halfway through. Bottom line, if you're into squad based combat games, and don't need fancy graphics, this game is for you. It's kind of like XCOM but without the stragteic base management, instead the strategic management is more about spending your xp wisely, equipping your troops correctly, and unlocking the parts of the trees that your soldiers need to upgrade gear\/abilities.<br><br>I hope these guys come out with an expansion, or another game. They have got everything right from the actual gameplay perspective, all they need is a little more polish on the graphics (better and more varied animations, a bit better UI) and sounds, but those are just a matter of getting better assets, not a fundablement problem with the game.<br><br>Good<br>* Writing is crisp and impactful without delivering walls of text. You also don't have to read pages of exposition up front, the game drops you in the middle of the action and the story without the need to explain everything up front. If you don't mind learning-as-you-go (I really enjoy it) then it's a great experience.<br>* Excellent balance of difficulty, fun, and excitement. I've felt challenged on most levels (occasionally I breeze through one), and even lost a few levels.<br>* The equipment and leveling up systems are great. You unlock gear through a requistion process, but you don't buy individual pieces, instead you can then assign it to any soldier. When you level up you get to assign 2 different and independent stats while leveling a talent which are the abilities you can use in game.<br>* The soldiers classes feel \/very\/ different from each other and there are about 10 of them. Even small loadout changes can really flavor how they behave and operate on the battlefield. You also have a lot of choices on how you want to mix\/match meele\/ranged.<br>* The game doesn't reward you for &quot;farming&quot; during the mission at all. Get in, get the job done as quickly as possible, and keep your soldiers alive. You get extra xp and requsition points for doing the right thing (not for sitting at a spawn and camping).<br>* The in-mission replenishment system is great. You defend control points and those give you supply points which you can use to purchase stuff like medpacks. These control points aren't in every map, and generally if there are any you have to bring an Engineer.<br>* The mission flavors are great. I always feel like I'm doing something new. They do a great job of mixing up &quot;defense, escort, push, speed, explore&quot; kind of maps. I have actually picked out different flavors of teams based on that. The size of your team also changes, and there are occasionally NPCs that come with you (which can be a fun way to play with a class you haven't unlocked through the requisition system already).<br>* The mechanics of the game are great, and there's a lot of stuff in the character page that helps explain stuff. I would comment that it's kind of hard to get a feel for if you're pumping a stat too hard. IT would be nice to see the dice rolls and calculations which drive the game so that you could get a better idea if you've put way too many points into accuracy.<br><br>Bad<br>* The sound effects are pretty terrible. The music is OKay, but the gunshots and alien damage noises are really repetitive and often times I have a hard time telling what they are suppose to be.<br>* There is no &quot;walk range&quot; indicator that shows you what tiles you can move to. This also becomes a problem when you're starting out on a new tileset because it can be hard to tell which tiles you can move onto. You basically just have to experiment.<br>* Graphics are barebones and animations are a little stiff as well as having exactly one animation for each action. No idle animations either. It's servicable, but not great.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"
