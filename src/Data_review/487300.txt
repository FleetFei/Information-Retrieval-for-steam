Those developers of unknown parentage!&quot;. However I do think this DLC is well worth it. The mistake made was to sell this DLC specifically as a map maker when it in fact includes much more. The other &quot;Real Maps&quot; DLC adds 32 maps to the game. This DLC adds another 10, in addition it also adds 14 alternate variations of existing maps for a total of 24 new maps. All of them are based on real Mars terrain and they work with all game modes.<br><br>So given that the other Real Maps DLC is 5$ and you're paying about 17 cents per map. This DLC includes 4$ worth of maps and you're getting the map editor for a dollar. If you're into Offworld Trading Company and liked the Real Maps DLC then you will definitely like this DLC as well.<br><br>---<br><br>For those interested in making maps here is some more detail about the editor itself. The map editor is fully featured and allows you to control every aspect of the terrain. Unlike most utilities of this type it has a polished UI and can be accessed from the main menu instead of being a separate program.<br><br>- You can set the size of the map by height\/width in hex tiles from a minimum of 12x12 to a maximum of 180x180, or simply use the default sizes from Tiny to Huge<br>- Elevation, terrain type and resources are painted using a hexagonal brush.<br>- Random maps based on the default presets like &quot;Canyon&quot; and &quot;Crater&quot; can be generated with the push of a button.<br>- Craters are preset &quot;doodads&quot; you can place onto the map if there is sufficient space. The rim of the crater occupies certain tiles with the inside being open to build upon.<br>- You can set a map to use preset resources (anything you place on the map) or randomly generated resources.<br>- Maps can be named and are saved into your Steam Cloud.<br><br>There are a few minor problems to fix and features I would like to see:<br><br>- There is no way to generate a map using a random or preset seed number<br>- Similarly to the lack of a seed there is no way to randomly cover the map with resources to check if the terrain distribution is balanced.<br>- The editor lacks a &quot;test drive&quot; mode to quickly jump in and test it out. The only way to do this is to save the map and load it up in skirmish mode.<br>- Parts of the UI can cover up other parts at certain monitor resolutions because the UI as a whole does not scale.<br>- The game allows you to put geothermal vents under other resources which I'm pretty sure is a bug.<br>- When editing any ice on the map, all of the ice &quot;flickers&quot; wildly as each ice tile randomly switches between different ice textures.<br>- As you work on a map it is rendered in &quot;wireframe&quot; with very simple blocky models. You can then press a preview button to see the map as it appears in full detail. However my computer can easily handle these graphics so I would like to see the option of working on a map in &quot;realtime&quot;.<br>- The maximum (minimum?) zoom level is insufficient when moving the camera outwards to view the map as a whole if you are working on the larger map sizes.<br>- There is no way to set a specific location for the NPC colony. <br><br>If any of this changes I'll come back and edit the review.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23880864', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23880864' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23880864\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23880864' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23880864\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23880864', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23880864_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23880864_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["23880864"]}
