If you love squad-based action\/strategy games as much as I do, you will undoubtedly agree. The character progression is great, the loot is bountiful and the gameplay is addictive. But what makes my heart skip a beat is the combination of believable physics with highly destructible levels... Enemies in the next room? Empty that machine gun into the door and catch them off guard. Goons in the basement? Detonate a charge and bring the floor\/ceiling down on their head. Pesky fiend hiding in the library? Have your skilled sniper fire a high-caliber round through two walls and a bookcase and right between the ribs... Take all that, set it in an increasingly fantastical version of WW2 (mechs, anyone?) and you have a recipe for good times. If the visuals and presentation were better, even a little bit, this would be fighting for a spot in my 'top 10 favorite games of all time' list.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('7499284', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '7499284' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary7499284\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '7499284' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary7499284\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '7499284', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7499284_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7499284_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t131 of 134 people (98%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/recommended\/254960\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14135603\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"35785970\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/198a52cdf0875608eb26ec4747e878069beb1d57.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/198a52cdf0875608eb26ec4747e878069beb1d57.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/198a52cdf0875608eb26ec4747e878069beb1d57_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/\" data-miniprofile=\"35785970\">Biggus Dickus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/games\/?tab=all\">351 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197996051698\/recommended\/254960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">30.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">THE BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT<\/div><br><u>Here's the short version or the TL;DR version.<\/u><br>Silent Storm is an amazing Turn Based Strategy RPG that has the most depth of any game i've played in its genre. It has hundreds of authentic and detailed WW2 weapons and equipment, challenging gameplay, attention to detail, fully destructable buildings and cover that realistically break apart and degrade, simple to learn combat system that is the deepest i've seen in this genre, very good RPG systems with Skills and &quot;Perk&quot; style rewards for leveling up with branching trees, 6 different classes each with specific perks and play styles, open ended missions set on levels similar in style to X-COM or Jagged Alliance, excellent inventory system, a choose and build your own squad mechanic with perma death to all squad mates and just an all around charm that lasts through almost the entire experience of both games. I probably forgot to list a few more awesome things, but there are some not so good things too. The Voice acting is rather poor and bland, the game can be fairly difficult to get accustomed to, the story is predictable and dull, the Stealth System never seemed to work very well and toward the end of the game your squad becomes overpowered due to the introduction of some fictional weapons and technology that detracts from the otherwise extremely challenging and detailed WW2 setting.<br><br>                                                                                    <div class=\"bb_h1\">FULL REVIEW<\/div><br><b>THE GOOD<\/b><br>This little known game is actually in my top 3 video games of my lifetime so far. I picked it up used (back when used PC games were sold in stores) at a Gamestop by chance. I saw it, by chance, on the shelf and saw the WW2 theme and all the different guns and cool stuff on the box and i decided to give it a chance. Little did I know..... It would become one of my all time favorite video games and my number 2 series that i desperately want to see get a true sequel. Since i bought it, which was back in 2003 or so, i've never met anyone else who had ever played it and when i saw it on Greenlight, I wanted so badly to see it get onto Steam because of how amazing a Turn-based Strategy RPG it is. It never got any real recognition nor any major awards, which was \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t to me (Journalists only give a real \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about games from Big names, like always and forever), but its honestly a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing excellent game.<br><br><b>THE COMBAT SYSTEM<\/b><br>Its more or less a hybrid of X-COM and Jagged Alliance. It has Turn-Based combat, which displays percentages on your chances to land a hit or sucessfully throw a grenade accurately. Theres some randomness to the game, sometimes a stray bullet will ricochet and strike an ally, enemy or barrell and cause some damage. Environments are completely destructable. This was the 1st game that had true destructable terrain and cover that mattered in game. It was years ahead in destructible buildings and made on a much smaller budget. The combat, for a turn-based game, is the most in depth of any turn-based strategy games i've played. Its a bit convoluted, but it does a great job of conveying information on any given action. In combat you can literally go anyway you want. You get 6 soldiers, send 1 soldier to a high window to be a sharpshooter, send 2 around the building on a flanking manuever, keep 3 together to flush out enemies and get their position. Once you see them, you can kill them anyway you want. Sniper shot to a specific body part, grenade in the window the nazis are standing at, spray an SMG or heavy machine gun and hope some of the bullets penetrate the wall or blow open a hole to get through to them or you can go balls out and fire a bazooka round at the window, blowing a gaping hole into the building and destroying the floor, wall and any furniture in the area.<br><br><b>THE WEAPONS AND WEAPON SYSTEM<\/b><br>The other awesome part, that i love the most, this game has A METRIC \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 TON of different weapons. Each with specific stats and all of them are realistic and accurately modeled to their real life counterparts with authentic names. Near the end of the campaign you'll start to fight and comandeer Panzerkleins which do use some fictional weapons, but the rest are historically accurate which always made me giddy. I love WW2 era weapons, and this game has them on lockdown. Not only guns, theres dozens of different grenades, medical items, ammo types, engineering tools and landmines that are all historically accurate too and add some extra depth to your combat abilities and options. They even went as far as to have a &quot;Weapon Familiarity&quot; system, where if your character uses the same weapon for a long time, he becomes more skilled with it. A nice touch.<br><br><b>THE RPG SYSTEM<\/b><br>Next to talk about, the RPG leveling and skill progression. You make your main character at the start of the game. After the 1st mission or 2 you then get to choose from a list of soldiers with specific personalities, backgrounds and classes. Theres 6 classes, Sniper, Medic, Soldier, Scout, Grenadier or Engineer. They all start with the class skills at a higher level and develop them as they use those skills. Kill some enemies, your combat skills improve. Patch up a squad mate, your Medic skills improve. As they improve, you can use better items. Theres something like 12 or 14 skills in total and each level allows you to unlock a choice of 3 or 4 different &quot;Perks&quot; on a level tree. Each class has unique perks, though some of them are shared. By the end of the game your characters could be a legendary marksman, an expert medic who can use any medical item and good with a rifle, or a grenadier whos as accurate with a Grenade as an NFL Quarterback with a football.<br><br><b>THE OTHER COOL STUFF<\/b><br>Character models themselves are extremely detailed in the equipment they carry. If you put some German M-24 Stick Grenades into a characters inventory he will have the grenades hanging from his belt or his chest slings. Knifes, pistols, ammunition all show up and have unique models for what types of ammo they carry. The inventory system itself is similar to Resident Evil 4 or Deus Ex Human Revolution in that it kinda becomes a minigame trying to cram as much equipment in as possible. After you gear up you use a map screen that you travel over to get to a mission. Random encounters can pop up on the map and you can choose to attack random enemies. Theres about 20ish missions, some take a long time to complete, some are short but thats not including random encounters.<br><br>                                                                       <div class=\"bb_h1\">THE NOT SO GOOD<\/div><br><b>ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES<\/b><br>Can't have the good without the bad. The problems i've had with the game, and i've played both games about 6 or 7 times a piece, were the AI, the Stealth System, the Voice Acting, the Panzerkleins and the Story. AI can be braindead, but it they're still punishingly difficult. Voice acting is very low budget. Panzerkleins make you overpowered at the end of the game and the Stealth system never seemed exactly as it should, though it still functions somewhat.<br><br>                                                                                  <b>IN SUMMARY<\/b><br>I'm out of characters to use, so in summary, the game is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing and its positives far, far outweigh its negatives. For $10, its damn worth trying and its extremely replayable. I tried to mention all the awesome mechanics and details but I know i missed or had to leave out a few. Get it for yourself, it never got the attention it deserved. It was a WW2 X-Com\/JA Hybrid that was built on the perfect engine for this genre. Its in my top 3 games, its up there with Metal Gear Solid 3 for me and thats saying a lot for a budget game that was $40 brand new in 2003.

And of whole this genre (or sub-genre) I place Silent Storm in the top 5 of them all. Even after 12 years, with out-dated graphics (which is still looks quite decent, though), with some flaws in the late progress in the game (yeah, I guess you've already heard of Panzerkleins) - still it is a masterpiece.<br><br>Why I praise this game so high? There are several reasons:<br><br>1) game's mechanics at first seems quite similar to Jagged Alliance. And that's not a flaw, because JA2 was one of the major swallowers of my time in the early 00's, compared only with Civilization 3 and TES Morrowind... More to it, Silent Storm is not trying to wear JA shoes, it walks its own path, and somewhat similar technical solutions only helps to get familiar with the game.<br><br>2) Game's setting puts us in the perils of WW2, but, despite the fact it was created by Russians (maybe because of it), it lacks many of typical unnatural cliche, WW2 games usually so full of. I can't say that a gameplot is a &quot;War and Peace&quot; in a new cover, but it is certainly a result of good thought. It is clever all the way through, it is not using dehumanization, so common in the late media (you know, &quot;good guys - bad guys&quot; pattern). Everybody are players in the plot, which makes it sound like a good spy story, with unexpected trivials and rivals along the way. And all of that still plays like Jagged Alliance! You get it now? Nival created a very distinct game, but was clever enough not to distress people with new gamedesign decisions. So it has a very comforting start, and then the tide catches you, and you swim into completely another world of alternative history, where Nazis was not a menace, but just one of parts of the long-going power struggle, with their own hopes to better future... I don't making excuses for Nazis doings in the WW2, mind it! Many of my relatives died because of them, and I hold that score with me. But then again. Axis warmachine was very far of those mindless Ubersoldiers from Castle Wolfenstein, and it is good that at least somewhere soldiers of Axis block shown as they were.<br>Oh, well, I'm skidded away a bit, talking about game's topic. Let's just say, game gives a very thorough dive into the WW2 reality... and then adding some spice with technologies-never-existed. Most of the players like the game more without that spicy part, but hey! All other stuff is great without any doubts!<br><br>3) And of all of the great stuff in that game, one of the most exciting features is the level of destruction you can add to anything around you. By that parameter, Silent Storm stands proudly above all other tactical games up to this moment! Battlefield Bad Company 2? Mercenaries 2? There are so little games where you can level literally everything to the pebble and dustl! But in the Silent Storm it is not only fun to do. You actually training your characters skills with every shot and explosives usage! So please, don't hold yourself! Shoot through walls and ceilings, blow everything apart! Become the weapon of mass destruction! Groovy!<br><br>Okay, let's finish all that praising: game has some minor flaws, but they are very little comparing to the amount of fun that game can bring to you. And it is on sale now!

It is just beautiful to see how building can partially (or entirelly) collapse depending on how many holes you have shot or blown up to its walls. That is not all however, as also the objects (your cover besides buildings) get damaged and in the end destroyed. It is an awesome feeling when after an intese firefight you look at the map and see how a peaceful English town or a industrial complex got turned into a ruined ghost town. These well modelled mechanics aren't of course just graphical (although they do look great for a game this old), but they play an important role regardless of what tactics you use.<br><br>Another thing is the original story, for Silent Storm isn't just another WW2 game that we have seen so many already. It becomes quite clear at the moment when futuristic laser weapons and power armors enter the stage.<br><br>Besides those two, there are these other basic features bringing depth to these games, like managing your team members, equipment, gaining experience, varying challenging tactical situations and such. Silent Storm is a well done game with interesting mechanics and other innovations.<br><br>If I had to address some of the biggest issues, they would propably be stability and voice acting. I did experience a few crashes, but they really weren't anything I couldn't cope with, thanks to autosaving even if I did forget to save often enough. The voice acting on the other hand is something between hilariusly bad and making you want to cry, but anyone who doesn't know what eg.

Take a special squad composed of sniper, soldier, grenadier, engineer, scout, and medic, and take them on different missions with or without allied help, as they use WW2 weapons to take out enemies, capture vital intelligence, and discover a threat to the world that perhaps, trumps the fight agains the mortal enemies... You can play as either the Axis or the Allies (slightly different missions and character choices). This is turn-based tactical combat done right (not that X-COM is wrong, but this game, with destructible environments (try the grenades, explosives, and rockets) and ragdoll physics gives very visceral and satisfying combat (complete with blood spatters on the walls) that somehow XCOM seem to lack. <br><br>The main complaint is the game turned a bit too sci-fi later and that's very annoying, and the end fight is also extremely annoying.

Recently I've been playing the new XCOM games and suddenly the fond memory of Silent Storm came to mind. It made me want to play this game again, because XCOM couldn't quite scratch the itch for me.<br><br>IMO this game is mechanically superior to XCOM, far superior in fact. The AP system, battleground layout, character progression, detection based on sight\/sound, different poses\/fire mode, separate body parts for targetting, special wound effects based on where you were hit... the list goes on forever. It got everything XCOM has and everything it does not. For example the stealth element could be crucial to a Silent Storm player, but it was not included into XCOM until XCOM2 came out. And let's face it, XCOM still hasn't had decent scouting mechanism, which is absolutely vital in Silent Storm. The creme de la creme of this game is that you can free shoot. I once had my sniper taking a focused shot to a bush because he heard someone got inside of it and no one ever came out. He did not spot anyone atm and the silhouette representing someone you heard has long gone. But I dared not send my vanguard solider to check it out so I ordered him to shoot the bush. &quot;Bang&quot; and that sneak mofo hit the ground. That brought pure \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. And did I mention the environment is fully destructable? I once had a whole floor blown up thus was unable to retrive some document.<br><br>This game is the opposite of &quot;streamlining&quot;. And it didn't care much about presentation at all, which is the only flaw about Silent Storm to me.<br><br>The graphics are quite primitive but acceptable given its age. The music is almost nonexistent. The sound effects are honestly really bad, worse is the voice acting. In addition, I don't really feel like this is set during WWII. Aside from the familiar weapons, there's almost nothing that reminds me of an era of great turmoil and catastrophe. The strategic layer can get really bland and lacks the feeling of urgency or suspense compared to XCOM.<br><br>To conclude I really wish there will be a spiritual successor to Silent Storm, with the nigh perfect mechanism and AAA presentation like XCOM's. That would be the best tactical game ever made period.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30715198', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30715198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30715198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30715198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30715198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30715198', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30715198_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30715198_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30319404\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198287973445\/recommended\/254960\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"327707717\">DocVogel<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 12.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a blast to play.

Those are the only real downsides. Don't watch the trailer, or look at the screeshots. Their marketing folks are butts full of stinky stupid (like most marketing people.)<br><br>Silent Storm is a fantastic turn-based shooter from Nival. The game is set in Europe during World War 2, and you are the head of an elite squad of soldiers, tasked with doing important stuff.... blah blah blah. The game's story is pretty bland and forgettable. It doesn't matter. The gameplay is what matters, and that's what excels here. You create &quot;you,&quot; pick a class between sniper, soldier, engineer, scout, grenadier, and medic. Almost DnD in some ways. After that and some basic visual options, you are put in the game world, and allowed to pick your team. There you pick 5 more mercenaries from a list of about 25 pre-created characters. I usually opt to pick a character from each class.  Once you do that and some more tutorial stuff, you are given your first mission. <br><br>The game starts out tough. Your characters aren't elite spec ops ninjas. I find myself yelling at the screen, and save scumming frequently, but you learn to love your rag tag group of mercs in your mission to save Europe (and possibly the world) from its demise.  Luckily, there is a great RPG element implemented for improving your team. Skill trees! Also, the game utilizes a mechanic not found in most modern RPGs. Your characters gain skills in activites they actually perform. If you are constantly sneaking around, you will improve at sneaking. Always healing yourself and others? You will improve your medic skill. You get the picture. It's awesome. <br><br>Upgrading doesn't stop at skills, but items as well. You can return to your home base and equip your dudes\/dudettes with an arsenal of gear. As you progress through missions, your selection gets better. You can also snag items from your missions and bring them back. I like to hoard grenades. JUST IN CASE :)<br><br>The options for completing missions are virtually endless. You can sneak through the maps and silently take out all enemies. You can dynamite, grenade, and rocket launch the entire map until you are playing in a field. Speaking of which, the environment is fully(ish) destructable. If you suspect an enemy is behind a wall or door, BLOW IT THE F*** UP. I've done it many time to great satisfaction. <br><br>The game gets a little sci-fi towards the end, which you may think is either cool, or silly. I prefer the latter. To each their own, it doesn't completely detract from the greatness too much. <br><br>Graphically, the game didn't age terribly well, but there are a few mods out there to fix certain issues like resolution and other graphical stuff. Check them out, and install them under great reccommendation. <br><br>If I remade this game, I would add the ability to mod weapons, introduce currency and some kind of market, and update the graphics to modern standards. That's about it. It's a great game and deserves a look. Especially if you like games like XCOM.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30230723', 'recent_short' );

We appeared in a quiet courtyard but in virtually every direction where patrols that you had no hope of avoiding.  I sent one of my two scouts up the north street with my sniper following along as support.<br><br>My other 4 went west My second scout Elf taking point, followed not to closely by my grenadier and a heavy weapons guy. My CO was the doctor who hung back enough to avoid any major risks most of the time.<br><br>My 2 man unit managed to take out a full patrol very quickly, a good grenade toss from the scout, a spray of some smg and the sniper picking off the stragglers it was over that side in 2 turns.<br><br>Things for my 4 man unit got hot fast, The patrol they encountered spread out taking cover, making use of grenades not an option as they had too much distance, and cover kept them safe enough an extended fire fight with all the patrols around not a good place to be. Doc used his kbar to break in a window and crawled through but kept his head down and ears alert. my scout was right behind him and  moved for the door, <br><br>Meanwhile my heavy machine gunner kept up fire to hold off the patrools, 2 now had merged up intoa  dangerous force. Too far to read the window, my grenade guy used a heavy explosive saved for emergency to blow a hole through the brick wall of the same building but into another room with a hallway running down the length. he went through and provided some fire support under cover that kept them focussed on him while my heavy gunner got through.<br><br>My scout and sniper had cleared a second patrol with quick brutal effect, catching them from behind as they had been moving in towards all the noise of the firefight.<br><br>My 2nd scout had gone trhough the door, taking point while doc held back to offer cover if needed. This scout a lass named Elf only carried blades no guns, she dispatched a german soldier quietly who was at the buildings front door. My explosives expert had set a few nastry traps at the hole in the wall before he and the heavy gunner moved out to join my scout at the front of the building.<br><br>Scout 2 and the sniper had cleared another patrol on the main street and met up with the rest of the team. both the scouts headed off to cross the street and hide among bushes and trees while sneaking towards a series of buildings along the west side of the map. My sniper headed for the attic of the building we had cleared and my heavy weapons and grenade guys took positions on the front courtyard LA my blonde from hollywould who we figured LA meant loves attention proceeded to use heavy weapons fire to soften up the earlier patrols now circling to the front after one had caught a nasty mine and the rest thought better and decided not to persude that route.<br><br>Great enemy AI btw <br><br>Doc was still lingering in that first room, just in case, and good thing to. No idea where the nazi scum bag came from but sudenly doc can hear someone out in the hall moving towards the front along the same path we had used and was going to perfectly flank LA and her partner. <br><br>Doc didnt hesitate, he pulled his kbar( did I mention I made my doctor a melee killing expert before a master of medicine?) and crept up to the doorway of the room that opened to the hall. as I could hear the unknown was on the other side abit past the door it was a prime moment to move out and Doc took the scum bag down with a triple stab to the back of the chest.<br><br>Meanwhile my sniper had finally reached the attic window and was doing some amazing work on virtually single handedly whittling down 4 patrols worth of men that LA and her partner had been holding off and softening up.<br><br>Over the next tenses turns enemy fire constantly peppered that buildings top floor, eventually lucky rounds caught my sniper through the wall forcing her back, but that didnt stop the fire coming her way, and it wouldnt be long before the entire area she had been at was gone,a gaping hole in a once lovely building.she wasnt doing to great and doc met with her in the saftey of an out of the way 2nd story room to patch her up. <br><br>My two scouts had gotten across the wide open street to the far north west corner but not without trouble, a sniper on that buildings 2nd story balcony had caught Kate and she was down though Elf had managed to drag her to the safety of bushes and stop the bleeding and stabalize her for the moment. So elf was on her own, she managed to get inside, had picked up an enemy smg and some grenades from dead foes, and used those to cause abit of trouble<br><br>we needed to all get across that wide street and while many enemies ahd died no small number whre left. LA being a blonde with serious balls went first managed to get most of the way across and grab some pavement and keep her head down praying for the best. doc had grabbed an enemy rifle and alongside my sniper where offering distant support fire as my grenade guy went out, but he wasnt going for cover.<br><br>He had seen the situation, he knew that sacrifice was going to be needed. and went head on at the single biggest cluster of foes, he got as close as he could while having 2 throws in him, and he made them count. decimating 9 men and wounding several more. but he was in the open, his ap spent and the next turn he was left bleeding out riddled with the fire from at least 4 enemies. But it had been enough. Doc and LA got across, and put up fire so my sniper could get over to.<br><br>Elf had at this time managed to locate several documents, and a enemy we needed to take prisoner. but had been disabled and only barely saved by doc who got her stabalized.<br><br>we had 3 downed men, and a hostage. no way to recover my man on the street without a bloody fight we hadnt the chance in hell of lasting through. all of us beat up, some still mildly bleeding. LA had caught a nasty bullet leaving her blinded for now.<br><br>I made the hard call. doc took the hostage, LA grabbed Elf, my sniper a russian woman named Zenilda  went to grab Kate, and we withdrew to the extraction point <br><br>That man I left behind, bleeding out in that cold street surrounded by nazi scum. Some times his face still haunts me until the booze blurs it out along with the name I try to forget. He was a brave man, he died to see the mission complete and his allies live. I never left another man behind.<br><br>This game is a special kind of game. It has many subtle layers, many elements that come together to create something bigger and more substantial then many modern games, it may look abit dated. but it never gets old.

It has incredible high production quality and graphics is insanely good taken into account it was released back in the 2004.<br><br>You could effectively compare it to Jagged Alliance or XCOM, but when you dig a bit into the game, it is very obvious that the gameplay is significantly deeper and more enjoyable. Did I mention it was released back in the 2004? It has completely destructible environment - yes, in 2004. Don't you find viable option to enter a building through the door? Make yourself a new door with a bazooka or any other explosives. It is still fun to play, even 12 years after the release. You could release it today with an updated graphics, and it would still be able to compete with the best turn-based games out there.<br><br>If I would ever become a game producer, I would buy rights to this masterpiece and make a sequel\/remaster right away.

LOS , stealth spotting, ricochets, ragdoll and ofcourse.. the physics of a totally (and I mean TOTALLY) destructible environment. Using the environment is now a trully delightful affair. <br><br>Got a snipers nest above you in a building with troops protecting the floor below..throw a nice fat HE grenade, watch the guy fall to his death as the floor below him crumples in to a ruined mess and crushing troops underneath their ceiling. <br>Make no mistake though, this is not an easy game as you progress later. You will need to consider choices with thought or permadeath of squad members may result. (You can reload a save if you have one).<br><br>It's not a perfect game but it was originally developed in 2003 (?). The visual mess of death and the environmental damage is quite satisfying too. <br><br>I'm not sure re: Sentinels expansion but I would STRONGLY suggest atleast the following mods:<br><br>&quot;Grenade Range Increase&quot;, &quot;Improved Backstab&quot;, &quot;Headshot Should Kill&quot;, &quot;Ammo Fixes S2 mod&quot;, &quot;Easier Medical and Engineering Items&quot;.<br> &quot;Skill Watchdog hack&quot; (is an important mod that fixes skilling up of your active squad)<br><br>You should also use the &quot;Save Mod&quot; to install and uninstall mods in to save games.<br>There is also a UI resolution fix for slightly higer screen level (see community pages here on Steam) which really is essential<br><br>This game cost me $2.95 on special I think..but even at full price of $9.99 it is ridiculously good value.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29053499', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29053499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29053499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29053499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29053499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29053499', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29053499_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29053499_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/254960\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 473 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["7499284","14135603","12456197","18709950","9202850","932601","7839407","14788248","7763118","14999880"]}
