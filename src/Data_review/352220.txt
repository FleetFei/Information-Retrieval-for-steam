This is set in the world of Glorantha, which already had a lot of lore thanks to its origins in tabletop gaming. KODP both draws from the existing lore and adds some of its own. My personal highlight is the fact that it avoids the overdone aspects of fantasy races - elves, trolls, and dwarves are present, but all in novel ways.<br>-The difficulty is odd. It tends to be high for new players, but rapidly decreases as one learns to think like an Orlanthi &amp; how to prioritize. Random events can still throw curveballs at you, though. It's also easy to get caught in a death spiral early on if you have poor luck with harvests. On the flip side, there are very few situations that are truly hopeless other than starvation spirals.<br>-This is a longer game than you'd expect. Even a short game will take several hours.<br>-The music and art are both fantastic.<br>-The map is the same every time, but the clans surrounding you are randomized, as are their chiefs &amp; your own selection of nobles.<br><br><b>Differences from original release:<\/b><br>-This is ported from the android release, and it shows. Several parts of the UI make more sense on a touch interface than with mouse and keyboard. The biggest offenders are the category sliders for diplomacy and noble selection. There's also no mousewheel support for scrolling through text - you're forced to click and drag everything. <br>-The UI as a whole takes up more space than it used to, but seeing as the game can now take advantage of modern resolutions, this isn't a huge problem.<br>-The mobile-centric UI makes some things more easily seen, but hampers others. My biggest complaint is the ring selection screen - there are no icons showing the gods of your current ring, so there's a lot of extra double-checking to make sure you're not accidentally overlapping worshippers. The exploration screen is also much more cramped than it used to be. On the bright side, it's now obvious that you can check the list of other clans during events.<br>-On first run, there's a semi-intrusive tutorial. I recommend following it if you're new to KODP, but veteran players can easily skip it(start a new game once the tutorial is in progress and you'll be freed from it forever).<br>-There is no manual saving. The game saves automatically when you quit, but that's all you go. Whether this is good or bad will depend on your opinion of savescumming.<br>-Several aspects of the game have been streamlined, all to good effect. Nobody's going to miss manually increasing their number of crafters or having pigs as a separate form of livestock.<br>-No more pretty graphics for your sacred time clan overview. :(<br>-Lots of new events have been added.<br>-All of the lore(heroquest or otherwise) can only be seen with the Steam overlay UI. Not a huge deal, just make sure you don't turn the overlay off.<br><br>tl;dr: Good game. Buy it. Cross your fingers and hope they de-mobile-ize the UI a bit.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17275367', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17275367' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17275367\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17275367' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17275367\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17275367', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17275367_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17275367_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t104 of 127 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17329771\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"42605013\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb8ca5aed9d4a7ee39ed21893085da70921e5d72.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb8ca5aed9d4a7ee39ed21893085da70921e5d72.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb8ca5aed9d4a7ee39ed21893085da70921e5d72_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42605013\">\u2620\u2720\u2629 Mr.Nekator \u2629\u2720\u2620<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/games\/?tab=all\">4,032 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/recommended\/\">73 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nekator\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 1, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlways listen to your trickster!<br><br>This is a very unique game, which i first played the GoG version some years ago.<br><br>In short you manage a clan in a unique fantasy world, which had to migrate to new lands. In this world the gods are very active and important, as are dragons and many other fantasy folks, up to the squishy duck people, who are always good to bully ;)<br><br>You lead your clan with the help of your council (which consists of worshipers from the different gods, with different attributes from customs, up to bargaining, war, magic and so on). They each have their own opinion on how to deal with the day to day activities of the clan as well as the many special events, which occur. <br>I, for myself, rarely play without the trickster, as he is one of the most entertaining ones (but often enough brings you into additional trouble).<br><br>You have three main directions which type of tribe you want to lead (peaceful \/ warlike or a mix) but there are so many different ways you can try to lead, that each playthrough feels different. For example by choosing different gods to worship and council members, the way your tribe develops changes, also the diplomacy with the other clans changes with each new start.<br><br>In the end your goal is to become King of this new domain.. or at least see that your tribe lives through these troubled times.<br><br>Conclusio: In short, this game has great replayability and brings a fresh concept with nice artwork and lore. Just don\u00b4t expect too much &quot;action&quot;.<br><br>Addition: If you already have the GOG version, the steam version is a slightly updated version (new events &amp; texts, a bit streamlined gameplay and such). I decided it\u00b4s worth to buy again, but that\u00b4s up to you.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17329771', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17329771' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17329771\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17329771' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17329771\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17329771', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17329771_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17329771_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20390188\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11682762\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b8\/b8a4d244e1a1ccdee44c610a0cf9714df1979f2b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b8\/b8a4d244e1a1ccdee44c610a0cf9714df1979f2b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b8\/b8a4d244e1a1ccdee44c610a0cf9714df1979f2b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11682762\">Wraith_Magus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/games\/?tab=all\">1,471 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/recommended\/\">75 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971948490\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">95.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am of extremely conflicted opinions on this game.  TL;DR, this game is unique enough that if you have any interest in its concept at all, you should probably get it at least on sale, in spite of its flaws.  <br><br>I also will not weigh in on the GOG versus Steam versions debate, as I don't own the GOG version.  The GOG\/classic PC version is less expensive, and has your clan tula (lands) improvements shown on a map, while the Steam\/iOS version has higher resolution support.<br><br>That said, the good: <br>This is a game of serious choice-and-consequence gameplay that isn't bound up in a single black-and-white morality system.  It can be a serious game of strategic choice and risk-management, as well as role-playing.  The world, in particular, is rather detailed, and while the simulation is rather simple, it does manage to leave a sense of verisimilitude in the world.  Other clans have military and economic strengths where their casualties and losses are recorded, and other clans feud and raid in the background without you.<br><br>It also avoids the &quot;snowballing&quot; pitfall of many nation-management games, since there is no real military victory in this game.  You cannot hold territory outside your tula, and only through extreme difficulty can you expand it.  Trying to kill all of a certain species leads to disaster, as you cannot accomplish it alone.  Although the game rarely tells you as much, it's a game of diplomacy, and if you enjoy playing the diplomat route in RPGs, you'll probably enjoy this game.<br><br>This is a game that tries the almost unique feat of basically being a visual novel-type choose-your-own adventure game that is also mostly procedural.  It has a complex story made of random events and random characters.  It also has a (non-randomized) worldbuilding lore that has quite a bit of depth and I personally just love mythological stories.<br><br>When the game works, it lets you sweat out serious choices of balancing risks like whether to tell your irreplaceable warchief to risk his life to drive off a fierce invading force, or whether to hang back, even if it condemns more of your (relatively more replacable) front-line soldiers to their deaths or even risk losing the battle and seeing your lands raided.<br><br>Then, there is the bad:<br>This is a game that unfortunately suffers quite a bit for simply never telling you the information you need to know to make proper decisions.  At first, it seems like trial-and-error gameplay where you have &quot;hints&quot; provided from your advisors, although you quickly learn they're generally useless as they always give the same advice no matter the actual circumstance.  (The warrior types will advise killing everything or offending anyone who CURRENTLY has a smaller army than you do.  The tricksters will tell you to lie to or cheat everyone you meet.  The diplomatic types base all judgements on who hates you the most at the moment. None of them keep your overarching strategic goal in mind, and they're often wrong, but then again, the results of events are random, anyway, and they always disagree down predictable lines, so that's no real surprise.)  However, when you start to understand some of the mechanics beyond what is just the random events, you start to realize the real fatal flaw in King of Dragon Pass:<br><br>In general, I love Crusader Kings 2, but I hate the events in that game because they feel so cheap and two-dimensionally random in a game that is otherwise fleshed-out, simulated, and whose mechanical underpinnings you can not only see and understand, but also manipulate when you understand them.  In this game, it's nearly entirely those random events, and you can't see most of the mechanics, much less understand how to manipulate them properly.<br><br>For example, while other clans feud and raid behind your back, you have absolutely no way of knowing this happens.  You will also suddenly find you made an enemy out of a former friend because you made friends with someone they hated, without the game ever giving you ANY hint this would happen.  This is an &quot;invisibility of information&quot; problem that plagues this game to its core: It has a complex set of inter-related parts going on under the surface, but the player is left utterly blind to the workings of these mechanics.  <br><br>This is worse than mere trial-and-error gameplay.  Trial-and-error gameplay, while frustrating, at least follows a logical cause-and-effect.  You come across three doors, and opening any of the &quot;wrong&quot; doors instantly killing your character at least follows a logical cause-and-effect that you can understand how to avoid the next time you play.  When a friendly clan suddenly declares a feud upon you for slights you don't believe you ever committed, however, there's absolutely no way for the player to understand what caused this effect, or IF it was even any of their choices which caused that effect at all.  <br><br>It's at times a game that hands you a panel full of buttons, and when you press some, will randomly either pat you on the head or scream at you for what a horrible failure your entire life has been, even when you performed the exact same actions in the exact same sequence, and it leaves the player utterly baffled as to what went wrong.  These are especially bad in the cases of those invisible feuds between other clans - there is never any way for the player to understand that these feuds even exist, so they have no means of understanding when they are treding upon someone else's toes, and therefore, have no reason to expect that event that SAID it resulted in gaining renown will suddenly cause you to instead LOSE renown without there being any warning other than your relations suddenly souring.<br><br>It's not that the game doesn't track these things: It absolutely tracks who gets angry for what reason, but it just doesn't <i>tell you<\/i> things that should be obvious.  For example, when negotiating within a tribe, it will say &quot;two clans are offended by the concessions you made to other clans,&quot; without saying <i>who<\/i> was offended by <i>what<\/i> concessions.  There's really no way to find out besides repeated savescumming and trial-and-error sussing out of the key variables. The end result is that you make guesses on too little information, then get told that some of your choices were apparently bad, but not told which ones, with no way of learning from past mistakes.  That really offends some deep-seated gamer part of me: Games should be about learning the mechanics and building up skill to do better the next time, but this game denies that to players.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20390188', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20390188' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20390188\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20390188' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20390188\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20390188', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20390188_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20390188_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22434857\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">Zorder<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/games\/?tab=all\">2,516 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/\">179 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPlease take into consideration that I\u2019ve never played the mobile or the original version of <b>King of Dragon Pass<\/b>. That said, I came into this expecting some kind of book\/adventure based clan management game but I was surprised by the sheer amount of detail behind this game. The first time you\u2019ll play through the game you\u2019ll have a tutorial to accompany you through the very basic mechanics, so don\u2019t feel scared if this looks too complex for you.<br><br>The game starts off when your clan decides to move to Dragon Pass, a place where other clans have also settled, some of which are already somewhat hostile towards you while others are your allies. In the beginning you start by choosing the background of your clan, including things like which deities you worshipped along the ages, who you fought, among others. Some of these have a certain level of impact on how your game will play while others are simply there for the sole purpose of giving a background to your clan (which you also get to name). The interface and the amount of options available can be kind of overwhelmed at first, but if you end up checking one by one and have the tutorial turned on, everything should be fairly easy to understand.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>The core:<\/b><\/div><br>At the beginning of each year you\u2019ll get to allocate your magic points on certain areas such as crops, herd, war, mysteries, healing, among others. This is a pretty important point, these will help determine how successful you are during this year and if you\u2019re not confident about what to do, you have 7 different advisors that can help you. Still, you must balance things, you should always save at least 1 magic point in case you need it for an emergency during the year, like to help turn the tide of a battle. If you aren\u2019t sure of what to do at some point, facing a certain situation, you should always click on your advisors portraits and see what they say, this is especially important for new players.<br><br>Throughout the year you can manage and do several things such as, farming, diplomatic relations, trade, war, explore the map, build temples or search for mysteries by sacrifing cows in order to discover new blessings. Of course, like in most managent games, you also have to keep your people happy and fed. This might mean having to offer gifts to your farmers or your weaponthanes (full time warriors). While you can just skip each season since you\u2019re not really obliged to manage the various different sectors of activity mentioned above, these represent the core of the game and if you fail to manage everything at the same time, you\u2019ll most likely bring a dire end to your clan.<br><br>Sending out expeditions to explore the map, establish trade routes and relations with other clans is vital to your success and might prove useful later on, if you ever end up in trouble. Of course, despising other clans or attacking them can also have huge consequences, which might not only come as an outcome from said clan but from their allies as well. Therefore, it is also necessary for you to be prepared in the event of a conflict by keeping a steady and reasonable army. <br><br>Upon taking certain decisions or by going ot the next season, you\u2019ll most likely trigger an event. These can be things like cases of adultery or other problems related to the common citizen, or more serious matters like dealing with an emissary, requests or threats from your neighbors. Combat occurs like any other event, a window will appear and you\u2019ll be given a description of the situation and various options on how you want to proceed, and each advisor will recommend a specific course of action. It is also in combat where you can use spare points of magic in order to increase your chances of success. Act wisely because not always the enemy forces are what it seems and a simple and harmless settlement might be allied to stronger clans.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Final thoughts:<\/b><\/div><br>King of Dragon Pass really surprised me, managing your own clan with their own unique historical background in matters of diplomatic, military, trade and religions nature, and reading through a great amount of lore in order to discover more about your ancestors and the different deities really makes for quite the experience. The only real complaint I have at the moment is the fact that you can only play a single game at a time, there are no multiple save slots and the game saves whenever you quit.<br><br>It is a very compelling game unlike anything I have ever played. It involves management, decision making and a lot of reading. If these aspects are appealing to you, I really recommend you pick this one up!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22434857', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22434857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22434857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22434857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22434857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22434857', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22434857_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22434857_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17270572\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ruzen\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"40085611\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78c664d09ecb0e704c73cadceffc0eb913161a2e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78c664d09ecb0e704c73cadceffc0eb913161a2e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78c664d09ecb0e704c73cadceffc0eb913161a2e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ruzen\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40085611\">Ruzen<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ruzen\/games\/?tab=all\">404 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ruzen\/recommended\/\">42 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ruzen\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI did play quite a lot this classic masterpiece back in the day.

Replay It again and again.<br><br>Game It self a classic masterpiece allready but I cant say the same good things a the port status. It truly lacks mouse scroll feature. Because It desinged for touch screen you have to hold and move the mouse to navigate though sub menus which is not frustrating but annoying to do. I wished they put more resources for the project to make It more PC friendly. There is no music sliders, Its just on or off. Manuals or other stories can only be viewed at Steam-in game UI, not in game. I relly wished the sub menus can be interract with mouse scroll just for quality of life.<br><br>...but never the less. With new interface, 400 pictures(+40 for Steam), more accessible infos and fixed some bugs this is definitely worth buying for a KoDP fan. As for newcomers, the touch screen mouse may put you off but the overall experience is definitely worth trying and see the ambition of old games when they thought about the story driven game.<br><br>10\/10 Game<br>5\/10 Port\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17270572', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17270572' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17270572\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17270572' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17270572\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17270572', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17270572_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17270572_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22617037\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">Orge Lambart<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/games\/?tab=all\">7,713 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/\">109 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b> I remember the days back when I was a child I would read anything I could get my hands on, so many amazing books, the Iliad and odyssey always were my favorites, Gods and Goddesses, wars, Trojan (not those ones) horses, Achilles and Hector.  I was enamored immediately.  I ate up any and all content that was written by Homer (Not the Yellow dad from the Simpsons, but the awesome writer) I couldn't get enough..  Greek mythology wasn't my only reading, I was also a huge fan of choose your own adventure books, the name of the book eludes me at the moment, but I remember being a space faring trader, the various pages dealt with you making choices which often times resulted in a gruesome and horrible death.<\/b><br><br> My first impression of King of Dragon pass reminded me of just that.  Getting the chance to choose your own adventure, pick you choices and see the consequences.  While the game does give you many choices and options as far as game-play goes, gauging how amazing King of Dragon Pass was difficult to do, I couldn't decide between amazing and awesome.   You start the game by picking various options which will build up a history and tradition for your tribe going forward.  Do you wish your tribe to be a war-faring and aggressive band of plunderers who worship the God of war, or a peace loving treaty driven tribe that spreads peace and love across the land  maybe you can't decide and want to be stuck in the middle like the great Stealers Wheeler song, <b>(made famous during reservoir dogs, an amazing movie by Quinton Tarantino, but I'm getting off base here)<\/b>  a tribe that goes to war to pillage and plunder their enemies but decides to make peace when it benefits them.   The world is your oyster, for the taking or the sharing.. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> The Story<\/div><br>Your clan takes refuge in Dragon's pass, from this point forward the game takes you through a basic tutorial, explaining various things, showing you how the various different options work, what other options do and giving you a headstart before throwing you head long a struggle to lead your clan for 10 years.  Can you survive 10 years as leader of your clan, while managing food, resources, protection and everything else you're society will need in order to survive.  The game at the start may send even the most seasoned strategy gamer running for the hills, but for those of us who strive and keep playing you'll be met with a really well put together game, loads of strategy options and a challenging game that pushes you to the limits of sanity.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> The Gameplay <\/div><br>At the beginning of each year you're presented with the chance to assign various magic points into certain areas, from farming, to combat, to protections, etc etc etc the game ensures to tell you it's a good idea to leave 1 point behind as a just in case point, this way help protect against an emergency which pop's up.  You're given advisers during the selection process, who will give you hints and suggestions on where to best utilize your points.   Much like in real life, you wouldn't rush into any situation without getting the proper knowledge, so I'd fully suggest you take note of what the advisers tell you.  Then again who am I.. you'll likely do whatever you want anyway :-D..<br><br>Between seasons you can micromanage several things, this makes up the meat and potatoes of the game, I won't go into full detail about all the selections and options you can fiddle with, but just remember these options will be what the game uses to determine if your group of tribesmen grow strong and tall, or if they die out like the Neanderthal, so be a good ruler and lead your people to prosperity and gain their love... or don't, be a complete ruthless #%@#% and lead your group to destruction, maybe you can play a fiddle with Nero while your cities burn, your crops die and the females fail infertile..  <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pro's <\/div><br>Challenging game play<br>Interesting scenarios <br>Amazing histories and mythology +++<br>Can be quite amazing if you enjoy reading like me <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Con's <\/div><br>Could provide more insight while negotiating<br>weak readers or brofist FPS gamers should avoid as the game requires lots of reading<br>mobile port may scare people... (It shouldn't)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Recommendation <\/div><br>  An amazing game for a person who loves reading, while the game certainly won't replace your favorite books, it will give the avid reader a new outlet to read while having some interactions in a digital form.  It's a awesome game for people who love strategy games, choose your own adventure books, lovers of deep and planned out mythology and any potential would be world leaders out there.  The game has so many positive things going for it, it's sure to entertain and enthrall you for hours upon hours of enjoyment.   I'd fully recommend this game and give it my own personal stamp of approval..\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22617037', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22617037' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22617037\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22617037' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22617037\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22617037', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22617037_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22617037_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17284457\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bcgaius\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"8293486\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb295f3fa401a15f0a02f4784368e4e2b03fe4de.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb295f3fa401a15f0a02f4784368e4e2b03fe4de.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb295f3fa401a15f0a02f4784368e4e2b03fe4de_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bcgaius\/\" data-miniprofile=\"8293486\">BCGaius<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bcgaius\/games\/?tab=all\">372 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bcgaius\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bcgaius\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 29, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPlayed the original from GoG quite a bit. This Steam release is a modernized version ported from mobile devices, with updated graphics, interface, additional content, and balance changes.<br><br>Simply put: One of the greatest video games of all time. It might not look like much at first glance, but this game comes from the same lineage as games like Crusader Kings 2. You manage an Anglo-Saxon themed medieval tribe, with the ultimate goal of forming a kingdom in the titular Dragon Pass. There are characters to manage with their own agendas and behaviors, wars to fight, beasts to slay, and people to feed year to year. Your characters will grow old and die as generations go by, and you must grow your tribe over time into the dominant force in the land.<br><br>It's not without a few flaws, however:<br>- It's a 90s game that's been modernized, and the audio and graphical quality is often poor.<br>- A few minor features have been cut in this version, like fiddling with how much barley you grow versus wheat (which was neither fun nor important). The only major item cut is a screen that shows an isometric view of your village and what you've built in it.<br>- The interface has been ported and has a clinical case of acute mobile-itis.<br><br>This game captured a magic that few other games ever have, and it's frankly a crime that it isn't on the Steam popular new release or top sales lists. If the minor flaws don't bother you, GET THIS GAME!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17284457', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17284457' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17284457\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17284457' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17284457\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17284457', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17284457_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17284457_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22378502\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"30875083\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/\" data-miniprofile=\"30875083\">TeeJax &lt;3<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/games\/?tab=all\">5,137 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/recommended\/\">71 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>I'll start by saying this game far passed my expectations and I've had a great time playing it. <\/b><br><br>I've always been a fan of any kind of game book, be it physical or digital but the selection on Steam has often left me hankering for more. King of Dragon Pass is the closest to what I've been looking for.<br>Though this is not exactly this genre it strongly reminded me of that style game, just with so much more content. The game has an abundance of choice, some affecting you on the spot and some with consequences that don't appear for many years so you're always on your toes and actually have to approach the game with a lot of diplomacy.<br><br>King of Dragon Pass is essentially a book-style game where you are the leader of a clan and, with the help your advisors, must try to become the King of Dragon pass whilst keeping your subjects alive and happy. You must manage your people (farmers and soldiers), livestock, food sources, goods and land whilst juggling alliances and relations with the other clans and factions. <br><br>The game starts you off with the tutorial which explains the basic mechanics of the game such as consequences of choices, how to use magic points, a few of the gods and how to worship them and a little about diplomacy. The tutorial feels very informative but I have to admit there is so much it doesn't actually explain. There is a fair amount of trial-and-error within this game because of this. I would recommend giving the top rated community guide a read AFTER playing the tutorial or after your first attempt at playing; it really does come in useful, especially if you're struggling to understand certain things. <br><br>When the game starts you make various choices about the history of your clans (which gods you worshipped, what happened at certain events) and this influences your gameplay for the very start. Once you've chosen you are started with a large enough population to survive, food, livestock and goods. You will need to manage all of these. The game runs in seasons and each season affects the way you should play (planting and harvesting seasons you should avoid raids ect). During the more relaxed seasons you can spend your time dealing with diplomatic issues, question for rewards to help your clan, trading, working on your devotion to gods, going to war and plenty more. You can also choose if your clan is a Peaceful, War or balanced clan. This will affect how others react to you.<br><br>This is a game that is heavy on the reading and should be avoided by those who don't enjoy having to peruse page after page. The quests are a series of events with action choices and the only way to know which choices are right is by reading the lore. There are pages and pages of the stuff and most of the quests are impossible to do without reading up. Personally, as someone who loves to read and loves extensive lore in games, I find this to be awesome. I feel as though the rewards for the quests are actually earned rather than just another filler for the game.<br><br>King of Dragon Pass does have it's flaws though. There is a lot going on in the game and there is a fair amount that is unexplained. Clans can turn against you without any reason or explanation why. Events can happen without you knowing the trigger. There is no real introduction of the trade system which I've found to be a very important part of the game. This being said, I've found no game-breaking bugs or any issues I have been unable to deal with. <br><br>Though a lot of people have mentioned the GOG\/Steam differences I have never tried the older version so I can't comment on that, but as someone trying the game for the first time, I really do think it's brilliant. I honestly wish there were more games like this on Steam and I know i'll be buying anything new this developer releases as I know i'm going to sink a lot more hours into this title.<br><br><b>King of Dragon Pass is a must try for anyone looking for a content heavy gamebook with plenty of choice and consequence. If you can handle a little bit of trial and error at first then at $12 it's well worth it and a complete steal if it goes on sale.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22378502', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22378502' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22378502\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22378502' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22378502\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22378502', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22378502_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22378502_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22837944\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">morphicmetal<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/games\/?tab=all\">5,105 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received King of Dragon Pass for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>King of Dragon Pass<\/b> is a strategy hybrid game with an emphasis on reading storylines as things progress, and choosing options based on what you think might be the best decisions.  I was initially struck by the massive amounts of information that is offered in the game, and how much give and take seems to be involved in order to find some sort of balance.  I liked the initial illustrations and choices that seem to be influencial in how you begin the game.  I'm still not sure how many of the mechanics work, but the game is very engaging and addictive in many respects for me, given the massive amount of things you can do on your own, or try to figure out through the manual you can check if you ever feel so inclined.<br><br>It's very unlike about anything I have played before, but in some ways it reminds me of a choose your own adventure book, but with more advanced consequences, and an entire system behind it with many things going on.  In another way it reminded me of Oregon Trail, but much more advanced, not nearly as seemingly rogue-like, and not quite as random, since choices seem more based on what you have going on in your tribe, and there seems to be more influence based on what options you choose to start with, or work on as you are going along.  You do have to stay on your toes, and try to work on where you are adding your magic stat bonuses, while you gather more resources and form alliances or hostilities between tribes that are competing against you for the same goals of various resources, power, and prestige.<br><br>I cannot really describe it much better than this, but it is quite a large system going on behind the scenes, with management of various numbers, and levels of morale to keep in mind.  Basically you want to keep order as best as possible, while interacting with other tribes and doing things for your own tribe, and improving your status among your peers to become the &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot;.  This is your ultimate goal.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><br>The various artwork on so many things that happen as you continue is really excellent.  I like the variety of how much I have seen so far, and the ability to choose situationally based on whatever random event might be happening.<br><br>Lots of various decisions you can make, which can have good and bad consequences on the status of your tribe.  There is a lot of things to keep you busy or manage, but choosing takes time away, so it's not an easy thing to decide on for me.<br><br>While I don't like the loop of the music, and would like more variety, I do like the sound effects when certain choices are made.  It makes the scenes more engaging.<br><br>I enjoy the magic points system, and being able to save these and use them in times of need.  Good to have one when I really need it depending on my situation.  The usage of new magic points every year at &quot;Sacred Time&quot; is nice too, since you can spend based on what you want to prioritize in the coming year.  I don't think these last beyond the year, and they restart every year after, from what I can tell.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><br>I would like a more interactive information system, but the manual I can go to and check is far better than having nothing at all in cases like this, where it's important to learn some of the basics and &quot;get your feet wet&quot; before going in blindly.  With so much information in the game, it would be difficult to make a tutorial that covers everything at any time, though.  <br><br>The music is not overbearing, but there is also not enough variety for me.  Better fairly low for me, or with something else going too.<br><br>I don't really understand the lore part, or the hero quests as of yet.  It gives a little information in the interactive tutorial about these things, and I am not very sure I understand exactly what this implies so far.<br><br>There is almost too much for me to understand what is going on as far as all the things that are happening all the time.  It's hard for me to keep track of everything, or know what choices would be better to make in many of my situations I am in.  It is good on one hand, but for me a bit overwhelming to see the full picture of what all is happening.<br><br>I could not raid certain places in certain seasons, but the places I tried to raid could raid me.  This was a bit of a frustrating thing for me.<br><br>Even a normal difficulty game seems very difficult to get very far with.  It's not that I am losing, but things are not going in my favor a lot of times, and I am not making huge amounts of progress.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Other Thoughts<\/div><br>This game is definitely <u>NOT<\/u> for somebody who wants to have some kind of action packed arcade-style game with fast-paced dynamics.  It is rather an unfolding of time based on choices you are making in the form of lots of dialogue, where you are confronted with  making the best choices you can for your tribe.  If, on the other hand, you are the type that enjoys a good read, or likes games that slowly unfold and allow you to manage resources, plan stuff out, and work your brain a bit, then this is a game that most in the second group could really enjoy.  <br><br>I had more cons than pros, but the high marks I give each pro would far outweight the cons.  This is a really great game, and a lot of time and effort went into what is being presented so far in this one.  While the price seems a bit hefty at first glance, the amount of sheer work and detail put into this is worth it at full price for somebody that likes a good interactive read that allows the player to have a good bit of say into how it unfolds.  That unfolding aspect is what is necessary to finish the book, so to win, you must gain the approval of those around you by doing what is best for everyone else.  <br><br>While I am still trying to figure many aspects about this game, I am again very surprised by the detailed amounts of varying things going on with this game.  It's hard to really find the words for this, but the experience is something I haven't encountered on Steam at all, and it's a nice refreshing style of game that I'm rather enjoying so far!  If you like reading, and enjoy a sort of strategy and rpg with a touch of resource management, then this might be something you'd really enjoy too!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22837944', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22837944' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22837944\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22837944' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22837944\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22837944', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22837944_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22837944_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22577859\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">Usagi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/games\/?tab=all\">2,099 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/\">141 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/352220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">18.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div><br><i>King of Dragon Pass<\/i> is an old-fashioned game. It doesn\u2019t rely on fancy graphics, big budget voice acting or orchestral music to tell its tale. It\u2019s more along the lines of a choose your own adventure story, every choice you make has a reaction and the choices aren\u2019t always black and white. The game has a rich story to tell and only using the right strategies will get you through to the next part. The future of your tribe is in your hands.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story<\/div><br>The most unique aspect of the game is that it offers many story options since your choices change which course you\u2019re on. The game starts with your clan\u2019s ancestors and you make a few story choices for them, like which god they worship.  After these choices are made, you\u2019re put in the shoes of your present day clan. The choices you made before effect the path your current clan is on, then you\u2019re put in control of things like farming, raids, exploration, and temple building. While you manage your clan scenarios will pop up with different choices to make, depending on what you choose you can send your clan to war, gain allies or a number of different things. You can change the story up a number of different ways and play your clan differently each time so no one story is the same. What does remain the same is the goal of growing your clan and being prosperous. <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br>This game has a lot of reading, it\u2019s one of the largest parts of the game so if you\u2019re not keen on reading this isn\u2019t the game for you. The game is full of lore to read up on and the story changes with each choice made, sometimes immediately and others not for years. In between events you\u2019ll have to manage your people, each year starts with a rundown of what happened the previous one, like babies born and such. You have magic points to allocate to different things, herds, crops, trade, etc and these help determine how well a certain field will go. After that you must then handle your people, keep them fed and happy while also appeasing the gods and trying to expand. Temples and worshiping the gods offers benefits to the tribe as well quests that offer mystical bonuses. Keeping good relations with other clans is also important for trade and other means of aid, as well as to avoid war. But war will happen and the battle system in the game is another series of choices; How many warriors to send, how to attack, if you should call on allies and more. Something is always happening in the game be it in your tribe or other tribes around you.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics\/Audio<\/div><br>While a large part of the game is text there are some graphics though everything is kept very simple. The game offers character portraits and illustrations to go along with story events, the menus are also all well done resembling old scrolls and parchments. The music in the game fits well setting the tone as the story progresses though is nothing too amazing to write home about. The graphics and audio are perhaps the weakest parts of the game, I found none of it to be memorable however none of it was bad either.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><br>+ A very rich story that changes depending on your choices.<br>+ Each playthrough is unique because it\u2019s choice driven.<br>+ Easy to spend hours playing the game.<br>+ Lots of strategy and management elements to keep your brain working.<br>+ Has trading cards and achievements.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><br>- Not very beginner-friendly.<br>- A lot of reading.<br>- No way to manage goods.<br>- Only one save.<br>- Apparently the Steam version has a few features missing according to other players, I have only played this version.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Thoughts<\/div><br>This game is not for everyone, it offers a rich story-filled experience without being flashy. If you\u2019re not in the mood to read or you want instant gratification then I would recommend a different game. However, if getting sucked into a fantasy world and controlling the flow of every aspect of a story is up your alley then this belongs in your library. It offers hour of gameplay and can be replayed numerous times for different experiences. <i>King of Dragon Pass<\/i> can be frustrating at times but offers a lot of fun in return.<br><br><br><b>Rating:<\/b> 7\/10<br><br>This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/elitegives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Elite Giveaways<\/a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22577859', 'summary' );

The strategy, management and RPG elements are skillfully combined with a rich narrative set in a fantasy world that manages to avoid being just another Tolkien rehash. The game does not hold your hand (though the tutorial is very useful to get to grips with the basics), and various kinds of information is not overtly shown, leaving it up to the player to seek it out and to pay attention to details revealed in lore, events and the advice of the clan ring members.
