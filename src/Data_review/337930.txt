Unlike Dandelion, however, Nameless is a straight visual novel with very little game play outside of making decisions at key points in the story.  There is a LOT of reading, so anyone expecting a similar experience to Dandelion may want to do a little more research before purchasing.  For those who enjoy well crafted visual novels, this is just the title for you.<br><br>Our story begins with the protagonist, 16 year-old Eri, living alone since her grandfather passed away nearly a year ago.  Her parents have worked abroad her entire life, and even now at this critical time of loss, they leave her to manage alone save for the benevolent, although slightly oblivious, school principal who keeps casual watch over her as he resides in the same building.  But life goes on... until Eri wakes one morning to find her treasured ball-joint dolls, the only beings who have kept her company these many lonely months, have magically come to life.  Now she must figure out how to work her new &quot;family&quot; into her daily life without drawing suspicion from those who know her best.<br><br>At its heart, Nameless is a tale of loss and abandonment, but it's also one of hope and renewal. And despite it's very romantic narrative, the underlying themes elevate it to something more than your standard &quot;feel-filled&quot; dating sim. The premise may seem a bit odd, but it works, albeit slowly.  The novel's greatest strength is in how every thread ties together the fabric of the overall story, but in a sense it is also its greatest weakness.  It is only through reading and experiencing everything the novel has to offer, including the multitude of bad endings, that one can fully grasp the scope of the story and realize just how closely every event is intertwined and how damaged each character truly is.  And it's only by reading the final hidden chapters that it's revealed how deeply our protagonist is scarred by the neglect she's dealt with her entire life.  These revelations breathe new life and meaning into the characters and will have you examining the story long after you've closed it for the final time. Unfortunately, some may lose interest well before those threads begin coming together, especially considering how slow the reveals prove to be.  <br><br>Despite the absurdity of the situation, by outward appearances this is a slice of life tale.  As such, the narrative pace is slow but nuanced with details that build upon another painting a portrait of Eri and the world she lives in which is explored through each additional story route. It takes well over half of the game to see the inklings of an overarching narrative, however, but patience is handsomely rewarded.  Your second and third readings of the common route will reveal new dialogues with characters whose routes you've previously finished, further developing their personalities now that we understand them a bit better.  And once you unlock the final two characters, things get quite a bit more interesting when darker undertones surface as you piece together just what has been going on all along.  I found it incredibly intriguing how precarious the entire situation is, with tragedy often arising from the most innocent of decisions. Make no mistake these darker aspects of the story will hook you like nothing else.  <br><br>Nameless is indeed much darker than it first appears.  Themes of abuse, obsession and abandonment play prominently throughout the character routes and are most apparent in the numerous bad endings.  Some scenes made me incredibly uncomfortable while others had me close to tears.  There's also quite a bit of sexual innuendo and suggestive language as well as some mature situations.  Although nothing explicit takes place on screen, I feel at times the narrative may be inappropriate for younger readers.<br><br>For the romantics, there is no shortage of romance here.  The story will play at your heart, twist it into knots, break it in two, and when the final confession of feelings plays out, race faster than it ever has as you wait with bated breath for that first lovely kiss between Eri and her chosen beau.  By the time the credits roll, you'll have fallen in love with each of the boys along with her, even the ones you couldn't stand from the start.  <br><br>The presentation is phenomenal with artwork that is both detailed and emotive.  Each character is creatively designed and drawn over beautiful backgrounds.  Gorgeous CG's highlight important story points while  the pastel palette paints a soft picture of youth and innocence with sepia undertones lending a nostalgic lens to the scenery.  Delicately crafted acoustic music selections complement the imagery with romantic, yet somber, melodies.  Most themes have multiple versions that intensify at key moments enhancing the emotional resonance of the story to great effect.<br><br>As one who normally turns voices off in these types of games, I found myself spellbound by the incredible performances.  After turning them briefly on to get a feel for the quality, I couldn't bring myself to shut them off again.  The actors do an incredible job of bringing each character to life with top notch performances that fit their personalities perfectly.  Every piece of dialogue is Korean voiced including all minor characters, something that is altogether uncommon for non-Japanese visual novels.<br><br>If I had to complain about one thing it would be the typos and awkward phrasings that are sprinkled throughout.  Most are rather minor and do not disrupt the narrative flow much, if at all, but they can be a bit jarring when they pop up during important emotional scenes, briefly pulling you out of the experience.  Odd phrasings (most likely due to sticking to the original Korean meanings a little too closely) can take a bit of getting used to as well, but everything is coherent and understandable, even if in a slightly roundabout way.<br><br>And now the nitty gritty, the price.  $33 is a hefty sum for any game, and considering Cheritz has never been known to offer a discount on their titles, you're unlikely to pick up it up for less than that.  So then, is it truly worth it?  In my opinion, having played at least a good 10-15 visual novels on Steam, and pretty much all of the otome available here (and elsewhere), you're not going to find better value for your dollar when it comes to the genre, at least not unless we start getting official Japanese localizations.  Fast readers generally log around 30 hours to completion while slower ones may take upwards of 50, assuming they're letting the voice actors play out their dialogue. Given the high quality of every aspect from the artwork to the voice acting and music, Cheritz probably could have asked for more and I would maintain it's still worth the price.  There are some who feel that no matter how high the quality, visual novels should never ask as much due to the nature of the genre itself.  In that case, perhaps this game isn't for you. But for anyone else, do yourself a favor, save up that $30 and buy this gem.  Every penny is worth it as long as you allow Nameless the time it needs to win you over.<br><br>Bottom Line: Highly recommended for both otoge and visal novel fans as well as anyone who enjoys a complex and well-written narrative.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14324354', 'summary' );

It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\u201d \u2015 Jane Austen, <i>Pride And Prejudice<\/i><\/b><br><br>This &quot;review&quot; that I will be trying to write shall be a genuine blabber gathered from my jumbled up thoughts and still strained heart, as this astonishing visual novel left me stranded and stole all and any coherent words that I may use in an alternative situation. For a girl who grew up as a wise loner with working parents and only a kindly grandmother to attend to her, <i>Nameless<\/i> was a game too close to home for me.<br><br>Our protagonist is a young girl named Eri - It's MC's default name, but you can give her any name that you wish. As our story opens its curtains for the first time, we learn that she's been living with her grandfather for a long while since her parents have been working abroad constantly. She isn't extraordinary, or even bright; but she is very kind and patient as any generic sob story anime heroine - remember <i>Clannad<\/i>? Seeing her parents once or twice in a year, Eri grew up as a lonesome child and picked up an odd hobby of collecting ball jointed dolls to relieve her from the burden of the deafening silence in her home after the passing of her grandpa. Her silent, routine and unremarkable little life was the same each and every day. She wakes up, goes to school, cleans and washes, talks to her dolls and bring the end of another day... until one morning she wakes up to find all her dolls magically turned into young boys! With this absurd event, the surreal becomes the new real for Eri as she tries to adapt to a new life of living with her new family.<br><br><i>Nameless<\/i> is a visual novel at its core: an incredibly well-written psychoanalytical + mystical sob story with fable-ish character and environment design. Yes it is also a dating simulation, but you really shouldn't expect common cheesiness of a casual otome. The game carries a definite undertone with themes such as abandonment, innocence, self-image, memory, the otherness and personal growth. None of these themes are taken light heartedly. If you are to pick this one, you really should be warned:<br><br>1. You are in for a possibly heart and mind wrecking experience if you complete the game.<br>2. It is required for you to complete game more than once to accomplish different character paths, and all stories come together to paint the grand picture little by little.<br>3. There is a TRUCKLOAD of reading for a really slow pacing story and some well put choice options in dialogue or action now and then. So be ready to read big time.<br><br>As a personal note: I am genuinely speechless. The narration, the storyline, the atmosphere, thematic choices, the soundtrack, the character design, the in-depth character analysis and progression + background are the best that I've ever seen in this genre. As if the actual game wasn't overwhelming enough - with at least 4 different endings for each character - we are given the option of collecting diaries of different characters in game to have some insight on their personal train of thoughts. I've just completed the game and noticed that I have 61 hours of playtime. Sixty - \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing - one! And this is me using skip option for some dialogue that I've already seen in different game progressions.<br><br>This was my first VN from Cheritz. Thank you Cheritz. You are an \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.

<br>d) the effort put into this game by a small indie company as well as the efforts the company puts into listening to its fans &amp; improving their products is amazing...the money spent on this is well worth the buy. Dandelion will forever be in my heart, but Nameless was an incredibly fun &amp; thoughtful journey.<br><br>Unlike Dandelion, Nameless doesn't rely on interactive simulation stat-raising and instead is a traditional visual novel where the choices you make determine which ending you get. The prologue is long, don't worry over not getting to the OP right away. Most scenes appear in Eri's school, house, and the caf\u00e9 Tei works at. The recommended playing order is Lance&gt;Yeonho&gt;Yuri&gt;Tei&gt;Red. Routes average 3-6 hours each. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story\/Characters <\/div> (THE MEAT. THE TURKEY. THE LETTUCE TO YOUR SALAD)<br>What\u2019d happen if your dolls suddenly became human &amp; lived with you in everyday life? I\u2019m pretty sure they've done this already (coughLife-Sizecough) but now as a dating sim by Cheritz bounds are, things are going to be\u2026interesting. Each of the dolls can, for the most part, function normally due to their doll concepts (interesting thing, as someone who is picky about typical tropes\/illogics I found that any appearing worked well for the game because the guys were actually limited dolls with unconditional love). However, two have come from previous owners &amp; ALL of them, being dolls-recently-become-human, are VERY MENTALLY FRAGILE\/INSECURE. Every guy was fleshed out enough to be understandable and loveable. They all developed very nicely &amp; EACH surprised me despite first impressions. I loved how character \u201copposites\u201d ended up complementing each other in each other\u2019s routes.<br>The routes are also tied to a deeper plot. It made playing them have meaning, which overall is a very smart thing, making the game end feel more complete &amp; satisfying (well, it\u2019s Cheritz, so...semi-satisfying &amp; partly angry).<br><br>Ironically enough, in comparison, the actual human characters end up not being as human. The bonus diaries help, but I would\u2019ve liked a little bit more meat (heh) with some of the side characters, ex. Shinbi. The ones worse off hands down, however, is Eri\u2019s \u2013incredibly shallow- schoolmates-cough-sheep. Oh my gosh. I get why they appear like this, but WHY. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO SUPERFICIAL<br>Another of the issues I have is with some of the bad endings. A few, though creepy, were unclear\/unbelievable on how they might\u2019ve unfolded. They also kinda overdid it with one of the characters &amp; led me into believing that he knew more than he did, &amp; it was really unclear what he was trying to do with some of the things he did in his route. The last problem is more of a nitpick, but is just questioning why the MC is many times described as \u201cplain\u201d when she\u2019s friends with the 2 most beautiful girls in school. I know it\u2019s a thing regularly used but\u2026gah.<br><br>Although the cast is younger, the script is more...perverted...heh...<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Press CTRL to skip unread text, right-click to access menu. It'd be nice to have a little picture of a keyboard &amp; mouse on the options screen showing keys you can press to do things. Would\u2019ve LOVED to be able to go through text by pressing arrow buttons instead of clicking only. Changing the screen to the minimized \u201cwindow\u201d version also made it difficult to access the quick save\/load buttons at the bottom of the screen.<br><br>A few minor spelling errors (the diary has a bit, also at some instances they mention a girl speaking when a male voice is used &amp; I still can\u2019t get over the phrase \u201cHe is my fist doll\u201d), but these appear significantly less often than Dandelion\u2019s. Yay for improvement! :D<br>A few other things:<br> - Texts on Eri\u2019s phone that pop out on-screen during scenes have to be clicked again after in order to be recognized as being read.<br> - After some Bad End titles appear, &amp; midway through the transition to the title screen, the bad end\u2019s music plays again for a couple seconds.<br> - Some awkward white transitions<br>EDIT: Major issues have been fixed and I've removed them. Still some small spelling errors but not so many that the ones left are more of a nitpick. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY &lt;3<br><br>Extra features included Eri's texts and diary being readable in-game, and in the Special section being able to read other character diaries as well, which was great and added some more depth. Unfortunately there was no translation for the audio clips in the Bonus section, so I didn't look into this that much.<br><br>The gameplay expects you to start a new game completely after finishing one route in order to grab a few more tidbits. The problem with this setup, though, is that most people are tempted to just start over at a common route save file instead, because going through the entire thing again with not much new content is really t e d i o u s<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Visuals<\/div>ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, this is what many people are raving about. Lovely cell-shaded character designs, &amp; soft hues of purples, reds, &amp; greys. The character animation is done very well \u2013 I notice a lot more movement while characters talk to one another &amp; it\u2019s not sudden or awkward at all. A good variety of facial expressions &amp; they blink, too!<br>The rain &amp; snow animation is excellent, maybe a little too good, because the feather animation looks a little too cartoon-y in comparison. Backgrounds are nicely detailed. CGs are well-drawn. Personally I didn\u2019t like the MC\u2019s non-uniform outfits, but that is my own preference. Other people might find them very nice.<br>Opening &amp; ending videos, for some reason, didn\u2019t appear as high-def as the rest of the game. They were nice but a little grainy.<br>(also, there are VERY SUBTLE references to Dandelion, both in background, plot, &amp; even once in casual script\u2026\u201dan orange, an apple, &amp;\u2026cat.\u201d)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div><b>Soundtrack<\/b><br>I am someone who is a huge fan of game OSTS. This one did not disappoint, it's wonderful. Being someone who\u2019s listened to quite a few drama\/video game\/anime OSTs, however, I was hard-pressed to find one that really stood out to me. Regardless I am still heavily considering buying the soundtrack.<br>In contrast to the mellow OST, the opening &amp; ending songs are pop-py &amp; upbeat. Like Dandelion's, the lyrics relate, something that I always look for. There are 3 regular end songs shared among the dolls, &amp; all the songs are sung by the dolls\u2019 voice actors which was A REALLY NEAT IDEA.<br><b>NOTE:<\/b> The opening song is sung by Red\u2019s &amp; Tei\u2019s voice actors. They also sing their shared ending song. Same goes for Yeonho &amp; Lance, &amp; Yuri's is with him &amp;...the creepy doctor Yujin both\u2026<br><br><b>Voice Acting<\/b><br>I became highly invested in Dandelion &amp; its characters in large part due to its EXCELLENT voice acting, Nameless proves superb as well. It is very WELL. DONE. DO NOT TURN OFF THE VOICE ACTING. THIS IS THE THING THAT MAKES YOUR PURCHASE WORTH. SO WORTH. (I think one evilly laughing voice actor had way too much fun)<br>I also liked how the MC\u2019s name appears in the script, &amp; therefore \u2013seemingly- appears in the voice acting, although it\u2019s not actually mentioned. <br>The one problem I have with the voice acting, however, is that the MC has none. It also made it difficult sometimes to discern whether she was talking in her head or out loud. I guess this is to get players to \u201cbecome\u201d the MC themselves, but emotional voice acting on their part actually helps me identify with them more because then I can get how they feel in a situation. They feel more humane &amp; realistic this way.<br><br>Due to a cut review I am pointing out issues\/opinions more, but aside from these, this game is great. I cried a bit.<br>Play it. <br>Enjoy the ride.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13711191', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13711191' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13711191\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13711191' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13711191\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13711191', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13711191_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13711191_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/recommended\/337930\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>21 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13603428\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"71778797\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6acb033156687d1fbfeb0f5fc58dd0664432484.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6acb033156687d1fbfeb0f5fc58dd0664432484.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6acb033156687d1fbfeb0f5fc58dd0664432484_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71778797\">Demoiselle<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/games\/?tab=all\">160 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/marigold\/recommended\/337930\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">55.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 25, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>WARNING<\/b>: If you suffer from an intense fear of dolls, Nameless will justify <i>every single one<\/i> of your fears and manage to create many, many more.<br><br>How to review a game without a name? A game in which you <i>read extensively<\/i> rather than running around smacking things with a giant sword or building stuff out of blocks that definitely aren\u2019t arranged in a way to suggest inappropriate aspects of human anatomy? By saying IT\u2019S TOTALLY AWESOME, that\u2019s how. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have far more sophisticated vocabulary after so many hours of visual novels, but no.<br><br>Yes, Nameless (if that is, in fact, its real name) is a visual novel, and unlike its predecessor, Dandelion, there\u2019s absolutely no stat-raising at all. Some people weren\u2019t fond of the excessive, sometimes tedious stat-raising in that game, but here there aren\u2019t any stats to raise, part-time jobs to do, or gifts\/power-ups to buy. That may be a plus (if you\u2019re like me) or a minus if you enjoy some sort of \u201creal\u201d gameplay in your visual novels (and\/or are a masochist\u2014kidding!). Still, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend playing Dandelion before Nameless if you can afford both, not just because it\u2019s also awesome but because there are some lovely references sprinkled throughout Nameless\u2014but they each can be enjoyed completely separately. There's a certain character you'll appreciate a LOT more if you've played Dandelion first, however.<br><br>You might have noticed the distinct lack of giant\u2026bosoms featured in the art on the store page for this game. Yes, those are all guys, even if some of them are exceptionally pretty. No, this is NOT boy\u2019s love\/yaoi\/dudesquared or whatever the proper term is. You play a lonely, secretly grieving high school girl, Eri (or whatever you choose to name her), who takes solace in her collection of ball-jointed dolls. (Google &quot;Crobidolls&quot; if you want to gaze upon their beautifully creepy splendor.) Thankfully, Eri's not your typical crybaby doormat \u201cn-no it\u2019s embarrassing\u201d otome protagonist. Her \u201cseriously unimpressed face\u201d (you\u2019ll know it when you see it\u2014and you will see it often) alone has endeared her to me forever. Though, like many otome game protagonists, she does seem to have issues identifying basic human emotions and physical responses sometimes. Yes, why <i>does<\/i> one's heart beat faster when an especially hot guy is nearby?<br><br>Those pretty boys in the pictures--Eri's ball-jointed dolls who ~somehow~ turn into hot human guys and end up living in a house with her (potential band name: Dolls II Men)--are her romantic interests, and they all have interesting and varied personalities. The doll-guys aren't your usual one-note, wish-fulfilling otome game love interests, either, with some of them having serious psychological trauma that needs to be worked through in their specific routes--but they can all be extremely entertaining and heartwarming too. If you\u2019re familiar with Dandelion, you may already be prepared for them to make you laugh, cry, and possibly curl up under your desk until the pain goes away.<br><br>What\u2019s a visual novel without choices? Probably something along the lines of a moving picture book. Luckily, that\u2019s not the case in Nameless. To replace the stat-raising, dates, and stuff-buying of Dandelion, Nameless offers a lot of choices for the player to make. Sometimes it\u2019s not entirely clear which choice leads to which outcome, which is exacerbated by the absence of some sort of \u201clove meter\u201d common in similar games\u2014like Dandelion. I\u2019d recommend Googling something along the lines of \u201cnameless [doll dude\u2019s name] walkthrough\u201d if you want to make sure you\u2019re on the right track the first time around. <br><br>Each character has a \u201chappy\u201d ending (relatively\u2014the developer, Cheritz, is deliciously evil, as you will soon discover) as well as MULTIPLE bad endings. Yes. Multiple. Bad. Endings. ENJOY. They\u2019re still worth seeing, however\u2014the story and universe are fascinating and elaborate and it\u2019s worth digging deeper, even if you have to spend a few hours crying under your desk afterward. If you encountered Jisoo's &quot;bad end&quot; in Dandelion...you ain't seen nothin' yet.<br><br>Others have mentioned the top-notch voice acting (in Korean), the gorgeous art and CGs, the lovely music, and the fleshed-out supporting cast of characters. One of my main criticisms of Dandelion (and various other otome games) was that once you choose your guy and start down his path (which doesn\u2019t begin until after you finish the prologue and a small number of \u201ccommon route\u201d chapters in Nameless for the first three available routes), everyone else sort of fades into the background or disappears entirely. It\u2019s just you and your man. Okay, looking at these men, that may be nice, but still. It's definitely not a problem in Nameless at all, since the story will keep the other guys and supporting cast around. Other people live in this world too, and they\u2019re worth getting to know!<br><br>One last thing: please go easy on the super-enthusiastic reviews from people with very little playtime\u2014as mentioned elsewhere, Nameless originally came out in November 2013 on Cheritz\u2019s website, and is one of the VERY, VERY few (excuse me while I wipe away a tear) otome games made outside of English-speaking countries to have an English translation provided right off the bat. It was released on Steam on Christmas Eve, 2014. (A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!) Otome fans tend to be very eager to support future possible releases (like the next game Cheritz is working on...!) and are often overflowing with enthusiasm for their favorite games and game characters.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13603428', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13603428' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13603428\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13603428' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13603428\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13603428', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13603428_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13603428_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20902215\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/octobig\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"96356605\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/321421d6bb5c8f1076963e19364015eed4c78822.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/321421d6bb5c8f1076963e19364015eed4c78822.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/321421d6bb5c8f1076963e19364015eed4c78822_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/octobig\/\" data-miniprofile=\"96356605\">Octobig<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/octobig\/games\/?tab=all\">46 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/octobig\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/octobig\/recommended\/337930\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you came looking for a light, sweet, casual otome game, you might be in for a big surprise!<br><br><i>Nameless<\/i> tells the story of Eri, a young female high schooler with a very lonely life. Ever since she was little, her grandfather has been taking care of her because her parents are too busy with research and are often out of the country. Eri's grandfather does his best to raise her but eventually, he passes away (about a year before the game starts). To combat her loneliness, Eri starts to collect ball-jointed-dolls of different types, talking to them as if they're really alive. It helps her deal with the sad reality that she's lost her beloved grandfather and that her parents rarely have time for her. But then one day... Eri wakes up to five strange, bickering boys in her living room -- her dolls have suddenly come alive!<br><br><i>Nameless<\/i> deals with heavy themes, from abandonment and loneliness to obsession and identity. Eri herself struggles with her lonely life, but her five now-human-dolls also struggle with their own existence -- some have to deal with issues left by their previous owners, others are unsure about their own self-worth and identity. Through each doll's romance path, Eri helps her dolls deal with these issues. There are also a few bad endings that are definitely 100% creepy, occasionally violent, and very dark.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Pros<\/b><\/div>+ A tremendous amount of character development for both Eri and the five guys<br>+ A deep &amp; profound psychological background for all characters<br>+ Fully voiced with high quality voice acting<br>+ Gorgeous art and CG<br>+ A mysterious, dark overarching storyline<br>+ The &quot;game&quot; is aware of how far you have progressed and changes accordingly<br>+ Nice soundtrack with custom songs for every doll\/guy<br>+ Lots of save slots and a skip option (though you won't need it often)<br>+ Two close female friends who play a role in every part of the game &amp; are very supportive of Eri!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Cons<\/b><\/div>- A few grammar mistakes &amp; typos, but not many<br>- In order to finish the game, you will have to play through ALL the romance routes<br>- Some of the CG pieces are a tiny bit awkward proportion-wise (especially Tei's)<br>- More of an actual visual novel; lots &amp; lots of reading with not too many choices<br>- Some of the bad endings might be too disturbing for some (though nothing is explicitly shown)<br><br>This is just a really, REALLY good game. I'm all about character development and psychological backgrounds that actually make sense, and this game gave me all that. I had a lot of feelings. I cried a little. I would recommend this 110% if you like visual novels and if the themes of this game appeal to you. It's better than any visual novel + otome game I've played so far.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20902215', 'summary' );

But I must say, after playing Nameless, this one too became really important to me. My grasp on the English language is very limited, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll try my best to express how much this visual novel means to me.<br><br>This game will break your heart. It will break you in pieces, make you cry, and make you wish that things could\u2019ve been different. But it will also make you smile, it will take all your broken pieces and put them together. This is without a doubt, one of the best visual novels I\u2019ve ever played. The story is somewhat similar to Dandelion, but \u201cdarker\u201d and most fitting to my personal taste. There\u2019s a lot of touchy subjects such as fear of being abandoned\/replaced, physical\/mental abuse, obsession, etc. But nothing here is just thrown in the air, everything has an explanation, and you actually feel bad for the characters. <br><br>My favorite route was Tei\u2019s. My heart really ached for him, and I cried. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve cried because of an otome visual novel, but his past is just too much to handle. I loved all the characters, but Tei\u2026 <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>I just want to hug him really tight and say he\u2019s not broken or dirty.<\/span><\/span> He\u2019s special.<br><br>The \u201ctrue ending\u201d blew my f*cking mind. I won\u2019t spoil it, you\u2019ll have to play the game.

If you've played Dandelion these characters are definitely darker. However they're not just like that as flavor. Their problems and pasts, and the way it's affect them, flow very well with each of the characters. They're all very distinct.<br>- The MC's friends actually matter. Her friends Soi and Shinbi actually have their own personalities and matter throughout the course of each route. They plays active roles in helping the MC out, as well as receiving help.<br>- Compelling story that gets progressively darker the further you get.<br>- The Art. The character designs, sprites, were all lovely. The backgrounds were nice, but in general I don't pay too much attention to the background art. (Unless it's Cinders, so pretty. *_*).<br>- I'm in the camp of those that enjoyed the audio, especially the music when things were going wrong. XD<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>- Typos\/Grammar Issues. Honestly my brain tends to auto-correct things to the point I don't always notice small grammar issues or typos when I'm not reading to edit and I'm incapable of editing whatever I'm reading, but I did spot some. I never felt like it ruined the game for me though. I've spotted typos in published books. It happens. It sounds like others have had bigger issues with this in the game than I did, but given the enjoyment I got out of this VN it feels like nitpicking.<br>- Some of the CGs were admittedly pretty awkward, especially those belonging to Tei.<br><br><b>The Price:<\/b><br>I understand a lot of people look at the price and wonder WTF? This is one of the higher quality games on the market with 20-40+ hours of gameplay depending on your reading speed. I played this when Cheritz first released the game. I don't know how many hours beating it the first time took, but second gameplays are always faster and it still took me 33.3 hours to complete.<br>That's not just it though. This game is fully voiced, has many CGs, audio, and has been translated. For its cost you get a lot out of it. Games like this run $60+ in Japan. In America, high quality VNs tend to be around this cost. Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi, Backstage Pass, Phoenix Wright.<br><br><b>But it doesn't have trading cards or achievements!!<\/b><br>Does that matter? You have a CG gallery, memory gallery, and diary entries all sitting there to collect. Good achievements are one you get for hitting points in the story (Dragon Age: Origins does this) or actual gameplay achievements (like for less story oriented games). Collecting all the CGs, memories, and diary entries are achievements. Yeah they're nice to have, but if the lack of them stops you from buying any game (unless you have already played the game) then you probably weren't very interested in the game to begin with. Having them or not having them has zero impact on the game itself, and to treat the game like it's worse because it doesn't have them doesn't make sense.<br><br>Finally, I want to address Voxit's review since it's one of the first reviews you'll come across.<br><br><b>** Spoilers Beyond This Point **<\/b><br><br>Voxit had a huge issue with the story. Yes, if you're attentive and enjoy figuring endings out before they happen you'll be able to do so. Does that make it any less touching? It did for him. It didn't for me. Unlike him I don't believe the necessarly game runs on trying to surprise you, leaving you unimpressed if it doesn't. If it did it doesn't make sense for the game to be litered with hints about what's going on. The story tries to warn the player. Honestly progressively understanding what's going on makes it as a whole creepier for me because I'm aware of how messed up the situation is. So there's another side to consider.<br><br>And then there's Voxit's main complaint. I finished the game twice and I never found Red to be the 'true pairing'. He states this but at no point in the English translation does it support this. (I don't know Korean, and thus haven't played the original.) This is assumed. Due to the personality of the characters and the situation, Red has to come last, but just because he's the game's last route doesn't mean she necessarily ended up with him.<br><br><b>The ending is open ended.<\/b> Therefore if you like open endings, it's great. If you don't you're going to have more of a problem with it.<br><br>From what I got out of the game, I think the 'true ending' is actually when you meet the secret character. What does this mean for her romantic life for those who read spoilers or already played the game? Open ended. Yes all the dolls end up in the same dimension and in love with the Heroine, but <i>she never ultimately chooses one<\/i>. Therefore the other endings do matter. It never denies the existence of any of the relationship, <i>it awknowledges them all<\/i>. At the end of the game she regains the memories of all the timelines, therefore she'd most likely be in love with all of them.<br><br>Maybe she started a harem and dated them all. Maybe she ultimately did decide on one, or two! Maybe she dated the secret character instead!<br><br>Do I think the dolls would have fought for her? Of course. The dolls always fight with each other regardless, but do I really think that it's that much of an issue? Nope. We see endings where dolls share her between them even in their most messed up states. At multiple times do they back down to let another doll pursue her, or even help the doll to this end! To a point they respect the others, even in their fighting, and ultimately they want the MC to be happy. It's even stated at the end by Tei that it required <i>all<\/i> of them to fill her heart, and they all understand and agree with this. So no, I don't think, whichever ending you decide to go with, that it would have been a problem.<br><br>I think it's of use to point out that the dolls are just that: dolls. <i>Her<\/i> dolls. It's shown that dolls pretty much love their owners unconditionally to the point of madness. Even when they become human they're still connected to their doll bodies, shown by the fact that if something happens to the dolls the same thing happens to their human bodies. <br><br>As for how the Wizard continued to make new dimensions I have no idea. Lawl. That's a flaw I'll tip my hat to Voxit. <br><br><b>** End of Spoilers **<\/b><br><br>I'll leave off with my impression of the game. Maybe the game is actually more about how the relationships between characters can change people for the better and help all invovled heal. It's about obsession and scars, how they fester, and how they hurt. It's about growing up and how people change in theat process. It about the fight between the private and public self. And it's about real friendships and the unconditional support they bring.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13968464', 'summary' );

I'm a sucker for stories that have proper progression and character development to match. Not only does your main character, Eri (who's name you can change), experience this development but all of the boys do, too. I learned a few things about myself and other people through the routes, in ways I wasn't expecting.<br>In terms of choices, there aren't a lot (in the grand scheme of things) and some routes have chapters where the are no choices at all. But a good portion of the choices are realistic for the situation. It's very much a story, but that was fine for me as I was captivated just reading and listening. That being said the voice acting is superb, and even for the characters that scared me pretty badly <span class=\"bb_strike\">Tei<\/span>, I enjoyed listening to them.<br>This game is long depending on how you read and listen, and you will have to go back quite a bit to get through all of the endings and to collect everything. This game can also get dark and\/or personal, nothing about the routes is all-around lighthearted, so that should be something you think about before buying. It deals with real issues in an interesting way.<br>This review is kind of long, kind of ramble-y, and mostly about characters, and a little about plot, as these things impacted me the most.<br>~<br><b>Characters<\/b><br><i>Yeonho<\/i><br>I'm starting with Yeonho because I did his route first (after bad-ending in the prologue), although I wasn't aware of the recommended order at the time. I got attached to his character the quickest, as he was fairly innocent and sweet. This is my first game in this genre so it put me off slightly that I was supposed to love these characters, Yeonho's put me off the least and I felt more like a sister or a mom, lol. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>This does come back to bite, as I got the second bad ending by being a bit too... doting? And thus, my game-long fear of Tei began.<\/span><\/span> Even after his route, and through all the others, Yeonho was kind of like a breath of fresh air when things got tense with the others.<br><i>Lance<\/i><br>I did Lance's route next, and I found his pretty tame in regards to Yeonho's (especially regarding the bad endings). I enjoyed his character in most aspects and was annoyed by some others, but especially as the game progressed I enjoyed seeing his care for Eri. His character progression felt very sweet and truthful. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Self-Worth is really not what I expected his route to be about, but it was beautifully done and I'm very glad it was done the way it was. And his bad-ends broke me.<\/span><\/span>. After his route I felt like he wasn't there enough in the game, whereas Tei was <i>everywhere<\/i>. And that might be why I didn't feel as attached to him after his route.<br><i>Yuri<\/i><br>Yuri's route really messed me up. It was the first one to really hit me on an emotional level. At first I was really nervous to do this one, I did not vibe with his character at all before, but it's my favorite route in the game and the first one to make me cry. Eri gets a lot of character development and Yuri does too. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>This is when the game starts to get a bit more direct with its plot, but despite that, Yuri's piece of True-Love is so shapable. Love yourself, love others, with your whole heart. I felt like such a princess during this route, not gonna lie, with a few direct ego-punches to my self esteem.<\/span><\/span> Yuri's VA knocks my socks off. Also, count how many times he calls you something that makes you both recoil in the cringe but also internally scream from the attractiveness, it's fun. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>After his route, and especially during Tei's route, he felt like a reliable character that was even more a breath of fresh air than Yeonho was.<\/span><\/span><br><i>Tei<\/i><br>Somewhere in the middle of Tei's route I took about a four month break. I, honestly, didn't like his character very much <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> because of Yeonho's bad ending and also because of what he does in his own route and everyone else's<\/span><\/span>. Every redeemable quality Tei has, didn't seem to make up for anything, and even learning his backstory I felt a twinge of understanding, but the <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>obsessive yandere<\/span><\/span> traits never seemed made up for, like Yeonho's did. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> For someone who's piece is Honesty, he may have been honest with Eri in the end, but she didn't seem to question the whole knee thing which greatly disturbed me, and he wasn't put in check for ALL THE TEA DRUGGING HE DID IN THIS GAME, and the twisted things; he didn't seem too remorseful about them either.<\/span><\/span><br><i>Red<\/i><br>As a big fan of certain types of cliches, I really enjoyed Red's route but there is a big glaring turn off in it, <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>While this route is the most blatant about the role of Nameless, I really don't like memory loss-cliches and even though it was used very well and very nicely, we didn't seem to get enough buildup with Red and Eri because of it. I felt like I was cheated out of some very cute scenes. Making up for this is Red's character development, and I can't really fault Eri for not having much of it this route. He matures nicely, indirectly describing a small existential crisis ('Pure Identity'),  but I wish we got to see more of it. It focused almost too much on Nameless for it to truly feel like Red's route. Although it gave me flutters quite a bit, haha.<\/span><\/span> and I wish we got to see more of Red earlier in the game, as he only really becomes prominent in his own route, sort of like Lance, whereas everyone else, namely Tei, seems to be in it a lot more. Red's route was my second favorite, despite this. (It also doesn't help I have an affinity for the red haired characters)<br><i>Soi<\/i><br>Soi was a character I loved to love and loved to hate, but I think she's written to be that way. <i>Especially<\/i> during Tei and Red's routes. Despite some obviously glaring personality faults, she's a greatly written friend character. She is important to the plot especially as it progresses. She has a really enjoyable theme, and her voice actress fits the role quite well. Soi is a really fun character, and I'm glad Nameless also focuses on Eri's friends, and gives them a purpose and also a message like the boys do.<br><i>Shinbi<\/i><br>The last character I'm going to write about (although I would love to gush about Zion), is sharp-as-a-tack Shinbi. At one point I called her the god of this game, as she seems fairly all knowing, but she's just a very observant friend. She's not in the game as much as Soi, but when she is she usually provides some insight. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Once collected, I think her diary is very sweet and describes a bit more about her personality.<\/span><\/span><br>~<br>The OST is very pretty for the game, and the character art is really lovely. <span class=\"bb_strike\">Also thanks Crobidoll because now I'm saving up money for one of your dolls.<\/span> I hope Cheritz can continue to make such moving games, because this game has become imprinted on my heart like a few forms of media have already. It's going to make you self-reflect even slightly, and teach you a bit about yourself... or, at least it did for me. It might not have an immediately replayable value, but it's that sort of game that will wiggle its way back into your brain and make you revisit some parts of it... it's an experience truly worth your time and $20.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29705009', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29705009' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29705009\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29705009' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29705009\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29705009', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29705009_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29705009_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/337930\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 353 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["14324354","15322241","19665313","13711191","13603428","20902215","15029828","28149263","13968464","25832501"]}
