It has a really unique and colourful art style, some great music and a very fresh take on an RPG as a rogue-like.<br><br>The systems that drive the game present a great blend of what you would normally find in a table-top style board game with the computer taking care of all the under-the-covers mechanics that can make those board games tedious. The devs have done a good job at realizing that the challenge from a game like this comes from the player having to make tough choices. <br><br>Each &quot;act&quot; of each quest has a timer that, if it runs out, makes progress that much more difficult (the Chaos mechanic). Players must decide if they have enough time to go down into that cave to perhaps find loot and experience but risk elevating the danger inhibiting the ability to complete their main goals. <br><br>Random encounters give the players a chance to receive a boon or bane, often having to weigh the odds and consequences of failure against the often unknown benefits of taking such risks. <br><br>Resources such as cash, healing herbs, equipment, armor and weapons that match the ever more difficult monsters and encounters are rare and as the quest progresses, more expensive to buy in towns. And this is the first design point where I think  the developers don't trust their own systems enough. In the first act a healing herb (in limited supply to start with) costs about the same anmount of gold the player can get by winning one encounter. In the second act the cost increases not incrementally but by huge factor (about 5 times or so) and in futher acts this rises at the same exponential rate. So much so that buying even one healing herb is so prohibitive it isn't a consideration.<br><br>While it does make sense that as the land becomes more perilous (and the monsters can drop more coin) such a steep ramp up actually removes a resource balance decision. There's no point in hoarding 10 gold to put to better armor or weapons later in the game when it won't even make a dent in buying a single healing herb. It also throws the suspension of disbelief when a single herb that restores action points is half the cost of an amazing weapon or set of armor. This extreme &quot;inflation&quot; seems to be implemented to fight in-game power creep instead of balancing out said creep. It also leads to a &quot;single strategy&quot; to buy up all the consumable resources you can early in the game and so makes the choice obvious (even required) rather than a decision to be made by the player. <br><br>The combat system is very innovative. Each character has a set of stats and each weapon uses one of those stats. When attacking or using an ability, from one to five or six &quot;coins&quot; are shown and the RNG determies the success or failure of each &quot;coin flip&quot; based on the associated stat. For some abilities to be successful, all of the &quot;coin flips&quot; must be successful so the higher of number of successes needed the less of chance the action is a success. Players can also spend &quot;focus&quot; to assure that one or more of the coins come up a success and the player needs to balance using focus for critical situations. And here again is  where I think the developers need more confidence in their own designs.<br><br>While the odds of each success and the odds of completing all coin successfully are displayed, I don't think the odds shown to the player are entirely accurate. I tested this out using some old fashioned card-counting and an abacus, which doesn't produce exact mathematical results but certainly points out some possible weightings over time. It seems that if players face higher-level monsters and some weapons, negative modifiers are applied to the roll but not displayed. I think this may be where some of the cries of cheating are coming from. The RNG seems very good in non-combat situations (such as overland challenges and disarming traps) so the discrepency seems very odd for just combat. This may just be a bug\/oversight but if it is an intentional design decision, especially in a game so dependent on randomness, it masks an implemetaion issue and is point of frustration at design rather than a challenge of a game.<br><br>The secondary attacks\/abilities use the exact same system, but always have a lower chance of success (which is actually displayed) and usually require more successes than a normal attack. For example a basic stike could have three rolls at 67% per roll (inflicting some damage per success) but a special attack has five rolls at 47% each and requires each roll to succeed.  It's a bit of a double-whammy intended to push the player to use Focus which provides a challenge, but it also seems that even if the attempt is successful the monsters have a good chance to avoid the effect. While the game does display what effects the monsters are right-out immune to, far too often using special abilities instead of basic attacks have too low a chance of success and a waste of time when a basic attack has a better chance of at least doing something of use. <br><br>The monsters follow the same system with a number of rolls and a number of potential successes. It seems though that even if the monster requires five successes to pull off a special attack, it does succeeds four out of five times. While the monsters should be better (and more dangerous) than the heroes, the incredibly high success rate of monsters especially when they need to make so many successes and do so easiliy, makes it seem like they are not subject to the same game rules as the player. It feels like, not so much cheating per se, but simply cheap.<br><br>The developers have designed a good core mechanic but seem to go out of their way to work around it by configuring the system (incredibly high monster success thresholds, exteremely low success rates of secondary player abilities) to bypass their own design. It's almost a shame because it seems a re-evaluation of the power escalation as well as the configuation of the system (rather than the system itself which seems solid) would shift this perception significantly.<br><br>Those mechanics, or rather the specific configurations of the mechanics, are to me what is holding back what is at its core a fantastic game.<br><br>Overall I'd say that &quot;For the King&quot; has the potential to be the classic RPG rogue-lite in the same way FTL is for the space opera. With a better balance of - and trust in -  the mechanics the developers have implemented I would give this an enthusiastic thumbs up, but in it's current state that thumb is a very tentative. I'm still going to be playing and following the development of this game because of its potential for greatness.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30716264', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30716264' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30716264\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30716264' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30716264\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30716264', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30716264_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30716264_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30584985\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ShaMedic13\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"66553937\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c54f811283aa6541e8d4658c2767af81e72028d7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c54f811283aa6541e8d4658c2767af81e72028d7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c54f811283aa6541e8d4658c2767af81e72028d7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ShaMedic13\/\" data-miniprofile=\"66553937\">Sha\u4e9eMedic<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ShaMedic13\/games\/?tab=all\">206 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ShaMedic13\/recommended\/\">14 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ShaMedic13\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">107.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game has impressed me, and it has entirely removed my free time.<br>However the game is currently extremely buggy (specifically the online coop). That being said I have played this game for 10 hours at a time and worked through the crashes because the game is <b> that <\/b> good. It is so much fun with two friends, and it is insanely difficult. It is brutal because a lot of stuff isnt explained and most of what I know about this game is trial and error and feverant googling on the forums for this game. This game is also so new it doesn't have a wiki, but in a way thats how it was meant to be played, I can't just look up the answer to &quot;Is the chest in the middle of a field safe&quot; <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> <b> ITS NOT (sometimes) <\/b> <\/span><\/span> which is where some of the magic of this game is, as I prod my friend to walk into a spooky cave while I stand back. Also I cannot get enough of the lore store, it rewards me for playing without breaking the roguelite aspect, I unlock new characters and content and it makes every playthrough fun and special even if it is the same old procedural generation.<br><br>In short, I HIGHLY recommend this game, and look forward to DLC, expansions, and anything else that comes out.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30584985', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30584985' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30584985\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30584985' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30584985\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30584985', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30584985_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30584985_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30348071\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissar_vodka\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"52992214\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e4bc4b251301e0b0065fef98e259d2a12118b11.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e4bc4b251301e0b0065fef98e259d2a12118b11.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e4bc4b251301e0b0065fef98e259d2a12118b11_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissar_vodka\/\" data-miniprofile=\"52992214\">Commissar Vodka<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissar_vodka\/games\/?tab=all\">422 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissar_vodka\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissar_vodka\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">27.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBought this amazing gem of a game for the purpose of streaming it on my twitch channel, ended up playing this non stop for the past couple of days!

You must be quite the intrepid hero to journey here. Or perhaps you're a bit of a gambler, dicing with death and fate?<br><br>Perhaps you're just a masochist.<br><br>This game is, as some other reviews have mentioned, an RNG-Pain-Hail Mary strategy game in a vein similar to that of XCOM and Darkest Dungeon.<br><br>You begin by choosing three characters to venture out with, with a somewhat small (but diverse) number of classes to assign them. Each one tends to specialize in various forms of combat, and as you learn later, specific activities on the hexagonal world map. Each character has 'focus' which is essentially a resource which you can assign to both combat skills and activities on the world map to heighten the chances of success.<br><br>Combat itself is a turn-based affair, in the fashion of JRPGs past, with your attacks having varying effects and levels of success, each of which can be improved by applying effort, as mentioned previously.<br><br>There is gear aplenty for your grognarding pleasure, with powerful items that break after a failure, to consumables which improve stats or offer devil's bargains.<br><br>Atop the world map, you navigate with each character individually on a turn-by-turn basis; there are random encounters offering promises of riches or woeful demise (all at the whims of the merciless RNG.)<br><br>The story is currently a bland and tropey affair, lacking the flavor and humor you would expect from the otherwise jaunty style of the game. It also provides the pretext of one of the only issues I have with the game at the moment, which is that...<br><br>...it's actually too difficult. I am by no means claiming to be a master strategist, but the difficulty feels TOO punishing once the story mechanic begins to manifest itself (Chaos.) This has somewhat less to do with being a bad mechanic in and of itself than it does with being stuck with a poor vector, e.g., the linear timer. If you do not complete the story quests within an extremely limited amount of time, the malevolences, they KEEP A'COMIN'. Once Chaos accrues (it proceeds in levels, and can be advanced through the main story quest not being done, player death, and extremely unfortunate random chance,) random encounters increase, characters can no longer be revived, and various other horrid outcomes occur.<br><br>Now, through the course of your game, you will accrue Lore, which is the one static resource you keep between playthroughs; you use Lore in a store from the menu to unlock additional items which will then appear in your subsequent playthroughs, as well as new classes such as Herbalist and Trapper.<br><br>Overall, despite the minor issues (and, by the by, it's Early Access; you'll encounter a bug or two, even if I haven't yet,) I definitely DO recommend this game for those of you who enjoy unforgiving rogue-lite RPG adventures with a penchant for scintillating highs and nadiral lows. <br><br>The music is pleasant and thematic, the graphics are unique, the gameplay is engaging, and the pain will keep you coming back time and again because \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 YOU SEA HAGS THREE CURSES IN A ROW INTO TRICLOPS WIPING MY ENTIRE TEAM.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30369569', 'summary' );

It makes an otherwaise enjoyable game feel like survival mode. You must work very hard to prolong your life, but you will die. You will lose everything. If you live long enough you can earn some perks for the next time you enter the world, but those perks never altar the crushing pressure. If you try to enjoy the side quests, you will die. If you try to just complete the story mode quests to tamp down the chaos, you will die, because without side quests and farming skill, you won't be tough enough to complete the story missions. A slider allowing players to customize the crush of the chaos would make this game appealing to a more diverse audience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30710648', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30710648' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30710648\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30710648' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30710648\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30710648', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30710648_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30710648_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30336709\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">genkipro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/games\/?tab=all\">3,920 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/\">130 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received For The King for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes.

Here there are no wizards, warriors, or rogues; they all perished in the initial stand against the forces of chaos. Instead, you play an ordinary citizen -- a blacksmith or minstrel, for example -- taking up arms to do what little you can before chaos kills you, too.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Graphics - For the King has a distinct graphical style, with almost everything made up of large polygons with relatively simple textures. But there's considerable attention to detail, too, and it all looks very nice indeed.<br><br>The overland map is viewed from a 3\/4 top-down view, with a look that's almost like claymation. Combat is viewed side on, with a moving that focuses on the action. It's in combat that the graphical style is particularly appealing, with puddles of large-triangle blood collecting at the feet of injured combatants, and fallen combatants leaving behind bones. Killed characters turn into ragdolls after their final hit, too, and collapse dramatically onto the ground. It's done extremely well and looks very nice indeed.<br><br>The UI lets down the overall graphical appeal a little, though, with what looks like default Unity UI text boxes used throughout. Tooltips need to be added or improved, too, as the current offering misses a lot of useful information, and the current interface for selling and transferring items is too well hidden. The tiny settings cog-wheel icon in the bottom right of the map is too hard to see and looks out of place; I'm hoping it's only a placeholder.<br><br>Graphics options are relatively limited, but should provide enough to play with to allow the game to run on a range of machines.<br><br>Sound - Music is typical fantasy fare and suits the game to a tee. Sound effects, too, are very well suited, with appropriate bashes and clangs, grunts and cries, and a few little lute-based-ditties when your party includes the minstrel.<br><br>There is no voice acting.<br><br>Gameplay - For the King begins with you picking one of three game modes -- single player, local co-op, or online co-op -- and then choosing up to three character classes for your party. You only have four classes from which to choose to begin, but you can unlock more by playing, and dying, and spending the 'lore points' you collected. At present there are eight classes in total.<br><br>The game is played in two modes: overland mode, and combat mode, with roughly equal time spent in each.<br><br>In the overland mode you move your heroes independently a certain number of hexes, visiting towns and shrines and engaging in other assorted encounters, and initiating combat with enemies. It's turn based, with each hero moving in his or her set position in the turn order, Enemies don't move about the map, but can spawn randomly when you enter a hex or at the end of your turn, making it dangerous to split up your heroes.<br><br>Combat mode is started when you encounter an enemy on the map. You're given a few options for initiating the combat, but the standard approach brings in any nearby characters: friend and foe alike. Combat turn order is seemingly influenced by both chance and characteristics, but with the mechanics not clearly explained. In any case, the bar at the top of the screen shows icons for the characters moving from left to right, and taking action when they reach the end of the bar. Your options for your action are fairly simple, though: try to flee, leaving your colleagues to fend for themselves; use an item from your belt; or use one of your equipped weapon's attack types. There are no fancy spells or cool abilities that you can choose to use, although some weapons and attacks have side effects. Regardless, you only get one action each turn, no matter what it is.<br><br>Everything in the game is heavily influenced by chance, with a 'roll' mechanic used almost everywhere. Don't be surprised to see your party wiped out by a series of unlucky rolls, or apparently blessed enemies. Unfortunately, the game doesn't explain in enough detail how these rolls are made, what they're based on, or what might modify them. Should I care if my minstrel is cursed and has -25 strength? The game doesn't tell me enough to know.<br><br>This seems to be a common theme throughout. Tooltips and in-game help, where provided, are filled more with flavour text than useful game information, and sometimes they're completely missing. Similarly, the help topics available from the settings menu seem more concerned with high-level concepts than with details, although some of them do provide a basic introduction. Levelling up, too, follows this theme; you're told when your characters gain a level, but the only obvious effect is that they get their health refilled. I'm assuming there are other benefits, too, but you're not told what they are, and you don't have any opportunity to make any character development choices, either.<br><br>Another theme that runs throughout the game is that of urgency. When you start you're given a certain number of rounds to complete your first quest. Each major quests is made up of a number of smaller steps, and the time limits are tight, with chaos increasing each turn you exceed them. As chaos increases, more enemies spawn on the map, and once it reaches a certain point, you're no longer able to revive fallen characters at all.<br><br>For the King includes rogue-like elements. Each game, the overland map is procedurally generated, effectively randomising the encounters and increasing replayability. There's permadeath of a sort, too. And the 'lore points' you collect while playing are available after you lose a game, in order to unlock various options for your next attempt. The choice is fairly limited, though, so this feature falls a bit flatter than I'd hoped.<br><br>I've seen a couple of minor bugs, with the worst being that characters highlighted right on the edge of the battle map when entering combat don't always show up in combat. The writing is mostly good, but needs a proof reader; some sentences are cut off and there's a fair bit of bad grammar scattered about. I'm hopeful these issues will be addressed before the game leaves EA, though.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n-------------------------------------PROS &amp; CONS------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Pros:<br>+ It's fun!<br>+ Great graphics<br>+ Good music and sound effects<br><br>Cons:<br>- Combat is too simple<br>- Too reliant on chance<br>- Unlocks are mostly uninteresting<br>- Not enough information on game mechanics<br>- RPG aspects are limited<br>- Needs attention paid to the writing<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Although it has a few problems, I'm happy to recommend For the King.

But it's so damn amazingly fun to play!<br><br>It leads you on thinking you're doing ok, then without warning cranks the difficulty up to 11. But it's so damn amazingly fun to play!<br><br>You will be in situations where to survive you need to make an easy roll, or the enemy needs to fail theirs. You'll get the worst and they'll get the best. But it's so damn amazingly fun to play!<br><br>You will be given impossible quests and run out of time causing the whole world to gradually turn against you. But it's so damn amazingly fun to play!<br><br>The game looks like a tactical rpg similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, or even Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. But don't be fooled, the game description is dead on when they say Strategy, JRPG Combat, and Roguelike elements. This is not an epic adventure that lets you take your time and build your team. You will need to make major decisions in how you proceed with what the game offers (or throws at you) and at some point these decisions will be wrong, and you will die. Or if not, then the RNG will screw you, and you will die.<br><br>Basically, don't expect to beat the game. I assume it IS possible, people claim to have beaten it and they probably aren't deities or cheating (but who am I to say.) What you CAN expect is a very enjoyable run-through, seeing how far you can get each time before everything falls apart.<br><br>When I started to write this, I really was not sure if I'd give the thumbs up or down. I would start a game, get to a tipping point where the game says &quot;F You&quot; and all hope would crumble, leaving my party dead and me quitting in rage and frustration. But, a bit later I would always want to start it up and try again. It really IS fun to play. A lot of fun. And victories really feel like VICTORIES, there were some battles that deserved songs written about them.<br><br>So yeah, try it.

I won't lie to you, this game is very hard. You're going to die. A lot.

Although it is still in the early stages, For the King (FTK) brings together a different approach to RPGs. The approach to the game is interesting, bringing a Fire Emblem overview while adding a turn-based combat style. The art style is great and traditional as compared to most modern games. I enjoy always having to make game changing decisions every round. For instance, every moment and move during each of your characters turn is crucial. I spent well over 5 hours on this game and still want more! Even with the amounts of deaths I have run into, I still want to play the game to beat it! Only consideration I would recommend is adding on descriptions for each status skill (talent, strength, etc...). Also, for items, it would be great if a &quot;(for battle)&quot; only and such would be added to help players understand items better.<br><br>I learned this game through YouTuber &quot;SplatterCatGaming&quot;<br><br>I cannot wait for the full game!!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30909066', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30909066' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30909066\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30909066' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30909066\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30909066', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30909066_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30909066_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30906887\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pelandes\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"144027050\">Pelandes<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 23.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't really do early-access reviews for a very simple reason: everything and anything is subject to changes. That is why I prefer to wait for the finished product. However, this game is already is a very much playable state and the campaign can be finished already, so I thought that it might be a good time for a review. That, and that this community could use more players. Just sayin'.<br><br>For The King is a open-world RPG in which EVERYTHING is both turn and luck based. You take turns in combat (like many other RPGs out there), but you also take turns moving in the map outside battle, only the character whose turn is it can interact with things and the quests have turn-based time limits. Your party does not move as a single group, but rather each party member (always three) moves on its own turn and can very well separate completely, and the only way to have them perform something toguether is to have party members withing a few spaces from each other (for example, engaging in a combat against the same enemies, going in a dungueon as a group or take the same boat at the same time). Everytime all three party members have had their turn, a &quot;Round&quot; passes (the day-night cycle and the quest timers are measured in rounds, not turns).<br><br>And it's luck based because all actions are based on visible dice rolls. For example, you want to attack and enemy with a Slash attack with you sword and the game asks for five strength checks, whose likelyhood of succeding is based on the Strength stat of the character performing the action. Roll all succeses and you'll perform a sure hit for the expected damage with a chance of criting. Fail some of the five and hit the enemy for less damage with a chance of missing. Fail all  (or most) checks and you get squat. Some actions, such as buffing or taunting, require less rolls (one-three), but you will screw it up if you fail any of them. All actions in the world map, such as disarming traps or investigating artifacts, are also dependant on dice rolls. To aliviate the unavoidable bad luck in crucial rolls, all characters get a certain number of focus points that can be expended at any time to ensure a succesful roll per point invested (and there are several ways to replenish them). Some classes also have abilities that let them interfere with other people's roll checks.<br><br>Despite the world map and enemy\/item pool being randomly generated, the main quest line is always the same. It's based on four acts with predetermined events and dungueons you must go through, although you never know exactly where anything is going to end up being, and some characters are better than others at certain tasks (because they have better stats for the rolls required). There is also a thing called &quot;Chaos Meter&quot;, source of many (MANY) arguments in the forums, which is essentially an indicator of how screwed up the world is. It raises when your heroes die in battle or when you are running late on the current main quest, and it resets after every act finishes. The higher it is, the more difficult the game becomes and at the highest point you can no longer revive allies, the game is throwing the most elite mooks at you and several harmful events start taking place.<br><br>Still, it is a rouge-like that I enjoyed playing and that I come back from time to time to try different playstyles. I say it's worth the price and see what the developers keep adding.<br><br>+ Average campaign time is three-four sessions, meant to be heavily replayable.<br>+ During the game you get certain items that are conserved after the campaign ends (wether you won or lost) and can be expended in a Lore Store that let you buy more classes, items and events that are thrown into the pool for the next map generation.<br>+ Lovely and simple 3D graphics that I absolutely adore.<br>+ There is talk of new classes and storylines in the forums that the developers have shown interest in adding.<br>+ The game can be played solo or with three players total (one for each pary member). Though, I only play singleplayer, so there isn't much I can say here.<br>+ The focus mechanic adds a layer of strategy to what some people would call a total luck-based bullsh*t of a game...<br>- ...which still isn't enough to save you from those moments we all know in which Lady Fortune hates your guts. It will happen, and did cut several of my playthoughs short because of terrible dice rolls in the most inoportune moments with no focus left.<br>- The Chaos Meter. Look, I don't have a problem with it and I actually think that it's a cool mechanic. However, that is because I rarely have problems staying on or ahead the difficulty curve, and the CM is designed to punish those who fall behind it by making the game even harder on them. It's easy to see why it is the source of a lot of anguish.<br>- Despite being the most stable Early-Access game I've picked up in a while, bugs and glitches are still there. I haven't found anything game-breaking, but you should still consider that there might be some problems with the game.<br><br>Despite it's problems, which are to be expected from a game in developing, it's still a product that seems more finished that most stuff in Early-Access anyway, and I'm having fun with it. This game shows some real potential and for that reason, it gets a 7.5 out of 10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30906887', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30906887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30906887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30906887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30906887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30906887', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30906887_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30906887_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30883802\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/steampoweredgoose\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"119485219\">Goose<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTl;dr: it's fun, but chaos meter rushes the player to do the quests which limits freedom.<br><br>This game is very fun in it's current state, and I'm excited to see where the dev team takes it. The only issue I see with it now is that there is a chaos meter which, over time, creates more &quot;chaos&quot; in the world, basically meaning more and more enemies will spawn until you die. The reason I find this troublesome is that it takes away the immersion and feels less like an exploration rpg and more like a rushed, linear, style game, which is what I don't like in an rpg. I like to take my time and explore every corner of every part of the map, and it's impossible to do that with the current system.<br>However, the dev team has announced that they will eventually release an &quot;open world&quot; game mode, where the player will have more freedom to explore, so I'm very excited for that.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30883802', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30883802' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30883802\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30883802' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30883802\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30883802', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30883802_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30883802_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30833574\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062519435\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"102253707\">Jclouse<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 31.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWriting this review while the game is still in early access.<br><br>Im having alot of fun with this game, if you can play with friends it easily becomes a very enjoyable experience.<br>The combat is intuitive but has depth,  particularly concerning focus, which rewards players for good decisionmaking and patience. There is a small amount of luck, I can't tell you the amount of times I've missed a 70+% roll or made a sub 40% so it does feel like it works itself out. I definitly don't feel offput by the rng. <br>The difficulty is HARD though, even on easy mode me and my friends have not completed the story yet in the 13.5 hours I have played. That being said the rouge-like elements shine through when you replay the game and get some new encounters that you unlock from the lore store making for a high amount of replayability.<br><br>all in all solo 7\/10 would play again. with friends 10\/10 would argue over loot again<br><br><br><br>Some things I would like to see moving forward:<br><br>Expand the store so you have more options to use your loot on. ** This gets a pass as its still in development<br>I would love to see more character classes and encounters\/items<br><br><br>Maybe have more enemy diversity in terms of design when replaying the game, I notice that while the world does re-arrange the dungeons names stay the same or the bosses are the same enemy type.

The game itself is really well designed, and has several good aspects. The first being that the map varies for each time you start a new game. This allows for unique gameplay every new adventure. Another great aspect of the game is that you have random fortunate or unfortionate encounters. From the weather being bad or looting a dead adventurer for free stuff. The game makes you take it all in stride. Besides these you have encounters that are unknown they could be bad for you, or they could be good. Your choices in these will often make the difference between horrible defeat and glorious victory. That all being said the best aspect of this game is that every little choice matters. From the characters you pick, to if you buy an herb or a weapon. Do you sell your old weapon just to have your new weapon be disintegrated? Do you buy an op weapon or get causitic ink to scare away the Kraken. No matter what the choice is it has a noticable affect in your game. For those try hards out there it offers a real challenge. It took me almost 94 hours of gameplay just to beat the normal mode! I still have no clue how you are supposed to beat hardcore. :) Overall I would totally recommend this game!<br>Some other things to note are that it has a pretty relaxing soundtrack, and the multiplayer requires a literal ton of teamwork (albeit the multiplayer system is still a little buggy).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30807309', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30807309' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30807309\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30807309' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30807309\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30807309', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30807309_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30807309_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30804035\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198117633505\/recommended\/527230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"157367777\">PROCarryOats<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while For The King was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStill Early Access. Maybe I am just bad, but I can't get past like the second quest line... On Easy. Ever.<br><br>I love most things about the game (music, artwork, concept), it's just that after 10+ hours I cannot figure out how to get anywhere, and I have a graduate degree. Maybe it's a bad degree. Maybe I should have gone on for a PhD. Maybe the devs should balance the rolling a little. Who knows? It's probably me. Good game, though. Colorful. Sweet bard guitar riffs. My wife calls it the &quot;screaming game&quot; because everyone screams bloody murder when they get hit. So get that PhD and play it with headphones so your wife doesn't try to divorce you every time you hit a hag with a hammer.<br><br>Recommended to friends and (importantly) enemies.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30804035', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30804035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30804035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30804035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30804035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30804035', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30804035_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30804035_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/527230\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 405 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30716264","30584985","30348071","30369569","30710648","30336709","30449949","30584889","30348837","30735238"]}
