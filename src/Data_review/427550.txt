Was Waldo at a political rally, a circus, a camping ground, sea world or heck even just lounging outside his house, cooking some hot dogs and hamburgers, Ms. Waldo and little Waldo nearby with their own red and white striped shirts.  I can't remember, I just remember spending hours at a time pouring over the books, gritting my teeth and mapping out a grid of the page, searching each sector just waiting for him to pop out before my eyes..  <br><br>Fast forward 20 - 30 years later and I'm still enamored with hidden objects, while I've outgrown my Where's waldo book reading days, I can and very much do enjoy playing hidden object games.  Finding various items scattered about a trunk, a chest, a crashed airplane, a Tibetan temple, it's all good...   Thanks to the publisher Artifex Mundi I have no shortage of hidden object games to choose from, whether it's clowns, carnivals, murder mysteries, I know seeing the name Artifex Mundi next to publisher I can be certain I'll be in for a real treat.    <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> The Story <\/div><br>When you were seeing off your beloved niece three weeks ago as she embarked on an archaeological trip to Tibet, nothing could have foreshadowed the dramatic events that were about to unfold. Only yesterday you received a mysterious letter from which you learned that Larisa and her crew had gotten lost in a snow storm.  When you arrive in Tibet you quickly discover your Niece has set out about 2 weeks ago and has yet to return.  Will you find Larisa, will you discover what happened at Shangri-La or will you become another missing person. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">  Gameplay <\/div><br>Gameplay is your typical hidden object fare, hidden object, puzzles, collectibles.  The hidden object comes in two forms, either words or shapes, they aren't overly complicated, and if you do find yourself trapped you can use a hint.  If that isn't enough you can choose to play a game of Mojong instead of solving the puzzle.   You also have a mix up puzzle to solve occasionally, a picture is broken up into numerous shapes, you need to twist and move the shapes until the picture is clear.   As you progress along in the story more areas unlock for you to search through.  The game also has several sets of collectibles, swords, coins, stars and apples.  <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">  Recommendation <\/div><br>If you're a fan of HOG's, you'll love this game, it's got everything a HOG game lover would want and need...  An interesting well told story, casual hidden object puzzles and crisp graphics and sound, I really don't see any reason for people to avoid buying this game, you should buy it now and start searching, start finding and enjoy this amazingly fun casual game.  Artifex Mundi has yet again brought HOG game lovers another masterpiece..  I certainly can't wait to see what game these guys release next, if it's as good as Tibetan Quest then i'll be a really happy camper.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22441408', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22441408' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22441408\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22441408' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22441408\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22441408', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22441408_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22441408_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22487099\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">morphicmetal<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/games\/?tab=all\">5,105 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Tibetan Quest: Beyond the World's End<\/b> is a hidden object game style game with nice visuals and an enjoyable storyline to adventure through.  You journey to Tibet to find out what has happened to your niece when she travelled there several weeks beforehand.  You will then begin collecting items and using them to unlock and continue forward through frigid and snowy landscapes of Tibet, and along with intricately designed and stylized Buddhist temples that align the high mountainous in the area.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><br>I like the art work of the people as well as the graphic style of the landscapes.  The animations are nice, and I think they add a lot to the overall game experience.<br><br>The sequence of events doesn't feel broken, and I like the continuity in the overall gameplay experience.  <br><br>There was a large variety of puzzles throughout the game, and I enjoyed solving them.  This has been a pleasure for me to play through.<br><br>The voices in the game are well done for the most part, which is a nice thing.  The mouth movements are right on par with the voices.  Nice to see this, but I cannot say how this may be if there are other languages to possibly try, since I did not mess with this to see.  Nothing interfered with my overall concentration or mood while playing.  Everything felt in place with the story.<br><br>I thought all of the sound effects were very enjoyable and how they should be, and it all fit well with what was going on.<br><br>Collecting the extra items is fun for bonus achievements.  I like having the side things to look for in almost every room that creates a sort of side collection as you are going.  Like a mini-game within the game.<br><br>Extras menu has some neat stuff, and I guess you can unlock other things in it as you go.  <br><br>Steam cloud functionality often goes unnoticed by me, but this would be nice carrying saves over if I played small bits on my laptop before going to sleep or something.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><br>This is sort of a gripe for most all of these I have played, and it's that things you have in your inventory will not work when they should in theory, and the solution is too linear.  You could use your one scepter item to solve many of the things you end up going out of your way for to get an item similar that works instead.  I do enjoy the extra stuff, but it's just something inside me that is a realist, so I kind of get frustrated about some of these kinds of things.  No reflection on the particular game.  Just thinking how I would be in the same situation...  Also the fact that many items that would be of use later are simply dropped and never used again.  If you kept the item the whole time, or simply went back for it over and over, it could come in handy for several other areas where you need an item to get another item, for example.<br><br>Other than the above, which is more of a universal thought about hidden object games and many point and clicks in general, I don't have anything to say here really.  There isn't much I can complain about for a hidden object game.  This one is very well done.  If I could nitpick, I suppose some of the facial animations look funny when they are speaking to you, in some cases, but I kind of like this, honestly.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Glitches<\/div><br>I found one strange glitch near the end near a certain statue you have to alter.  Going two rooms back, then moving into that room makes duplicate scepters.  I think this might only trigger after a conversation in the mausoleum, and the need to grab a gem in that room to charge the scepter, but it was strange to hear the noise and see the number continue to increase.  The noise and increase stopped once I picked up the appropriate item to continue on.<br><br><b>**********    GAME-BREAKING BUG!!    **********<\/b><br><br>I completely broke my first playthrough by using the teleport feature after going through the portal near the end.  I couldn't use the portal anymore, and I just got a white screen when I entered the room to teleport, so there is no way back.  Maybe there will be an eventual fix for this, so I can finish the game on my original playthrough, but at the current time, there is no real fix for this at the time of writing, and the only solution is starting a new game!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Other Thoughts<\/div><br>This is a terrific game, and for anyone who likes hidden object games, I highly recommend this.  It's a lot of fun and everything about it exemplifies the genre, from the art to the music to the overall continuity in story.  The puzzles and the finding of objects is great and they do a nice job changing it up a bit with the puzzles, as well as the situational use of objects to find other ones.  This makes me want to play more of the games I already have by Artifex Mundi, since I'm so impressed with this title.  I will not hesitate to grab more of these in the future!  Completely all around great hidden object game.<br><br><b>** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

Why does this game make me laugh so hard - all the out of place and out of time items throughout the game and in the Hidden Object scenes. (Too many to mention)  Please Brave Giant (developers) this is the age of the internet, your research and development team and quality control team simply could not find enough items of Tibetan origin?  From the 1920s?  Tibet is an ancient culture, heavily influenced by repetitive Chinese invasion and Buddahism, but still a culture completely its own.  So where are the prayer wheels? There is not a single prayer wheel anywhere in this Tibetan Quest.  The icing on the cake, however, the most out of place thing in the entire game had to be the Komodo dragon.  Seriously?  Komodo dragons live on a few remote islands in the TROPICS, are longer then people are tall, and WILL EAT YOU for lunch without warning.  How could it possibly stay alive in the Himalaya Mountains in sub-zero weather?  At least I did not have to feed it bread to make it go away or that would have made this game beyond dumb. <br><br>Enough kvetching about out of place\/time objects - Storyline: Late 1920s. Larisa and her boyfriend leave for an archealogical mission in Tibet.  Time goes by and the aunt does not hear from her niece.  Instead she (the aunt, you as the player) receives word from Tibet Consul her niece and company have gone missing.  Off to Tibet she goes to find her niece.<br><br>Gameplay:  Fairly standard storyline. Beautiful, detailed, colorful artwork - the water is absolutely sublime.  The cut scenes short and long are worth watching.  There is a fast travel map, but not really needed.  The game is very linear and is completed by areas of possibly 4-5 locations each area.  <br><br>Point and click, find and use inventory and hidden object scenes.  The logic of the inventory items for certain tasks is highly debatable.  In one case a pointed seashell is used to chip out a &quot;granite&quot; rock yet in another case a pickaxe is needed to break &quot;granite&quot; rock.  This happens frequently so be creative and try everything, it might work.  Other then that the gameplay is fairly simple and easy to figure out. Very linear even in the point and click inventory - nothing gets held over from area to area.<br><br>Hidden object scenes are fast, simple and easy.  However there is an object or three that are just a bit more well hidden so will take a little longer to find.  Nothing unfairly hidden, just so many out of place and out of time objects it is amusing. <br><br>There are the standard extras (concept art, cutsceens, music), and a very short bonus chapter which is basically an epilogue.  There are four extra hidden finds throughout the game and can be accessed directly from the game menu.  Plus the finale is a Boss Battle with the dragon.     <br><br>In conclusion, family friendly, fun, relatively easy, hidden object with a DRAGON (who can go wrong with a dragon even if it is chasing you).  As for price: the game itself - full price, all the out of time\/place distractions - look for a sale\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25169248', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25169248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25169248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25169248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25169248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25169248', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25169248_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25169248_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22353050\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">Vic=HKC=<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/games\/?tab=all\">2,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/\">343 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYour niece Larissa embarked on a journey to the mythical Shangri-La, however, her party goes missing during a snowstorm. Not caring at all for your life, you follow her footsteps to rescue her...<br><br>That's the plot of the game: as usual, Artifex Mundi knows to choose the games with interesting stories. I really liked the beginning, though the ending was a little less well-written: it cuts abruptly and it's clear that it needs at least some more explanations or a sequel. Also, I'm wondering how the heroin, which must middle-aged and with a lot of money, ended up with nothing to advance a little more faster and fly a plane. It means that she was at least an adventurer in her youth.<br><br>The gameplay is pretty standard: find items, solve puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes (list or shaped). There is a little minor problem: the balance between the list of words and the list of shapes isn't great as you have more of the former than the latter. The puzzles are as usual easy to finish. You even have some passages (like the repair of the plane) where you're guided step-by-step and where you'll need to use objects you found earlier (or that you will find after when you can't advance anymore). You have also a game of mahjong (not really developped as there are only 2 or 3 different patterns and you can't be stuck, as it's shuffling automatically) if you don't want to play the hidden object scenes.<br><br>However, some actions aren't making sense: I've a staff that can melt ice and I need a magnifying glass at one moment for that specific act. Or also, a giant lizard is blocking the way and you have a sleeping potion in your inventory. My first move was to give it to it. Well, no. I needed to give it first a rake, so that I can get a pole, then use it as an harpoon to get a fish and to give it to the animal. And the sleeping potion. Well, apparently, it's better to use it on a spider than on the lizard...<br><br>While I loved the graphics and the beauty of the temples or of the mountain, there are two problems: I didn't like how the characters were animated. It's not fitting really well with the rest of the game and besides, I don't know why the faces were weird. The second little minor problem is probably how the developers are seeing Tibet as I was more under the impression to be in another province of China than Tibet itself. Besides, given the era where the story is set, I don't think that Tibet was already ruled by China at that moment. I suppose that they let their imagination (and their own view\/stereotypes) instead of using a little more documentation and to avoid some clich\u00e9s.<br><br>I liked the soundtrack, that's a real strong point here. It was very enjoyable all along and fitting to the ambiance.<br><br>Tibetan Quest isn't perhaps the best in terms of gameplay but I've been hooked into that magical world (even if it's not really Tibetan in itself). I liked it a lot. As usual, Artifex Mundi chose well. However, the next time, if they can at least choose a game with a better ending or publish the first The Secret Order and the others Vampire Legends if they managed to get the rights for Steam, I would be very happy.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22353050', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22353050' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22353050\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22353050' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22353050\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22353050', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22353050_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22353050_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22604490\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/drpixel\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"79151806\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e50bd053395c577d279edafed09317a97b9e987.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e50bd053395c577d279edafed09317a97b9e987.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e50bd053395c577d279edafed09317a97b9e987_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/drpixel\/\" data-miniprofile=\"79151806\">DrPixel<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/drpixel\/games\/?tab=all\">4,692 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/drpixel\/recommended\/\">23 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/drpixel\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>Note: I'll be referring to &quot;HOGs&quot;, also known as &quot;hidden object games&quot; throughout this review. More on that later.<\/i><br><br>So, by now it's fairly clear that Artifex Mundi is the king of HOGs, or hidden object games, on Steam. Well, how does their most recent title fare? Let's find out!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Breakdown<\/div>Tibetan Quest is the newest title from Artifex Mundi, the Polish developers (and publishers) of dozens of HOGs, many of which are on Steam. From my personal experience, I've really enjoyed most of the games I've played from them (Time Mysteries 1 was an exception, but it was also one of their first games so that's a bit excusable), so I was looking forward to trying out this new one. Thankfully, it delivered!<br><br>The gameplay of Tibetan Quest consists of what you'd expect from a HOG: visit a bunch of areas, solve puzzles using items to progress, complete some minigames, and most importantly, play some hidden object scenes! Now, you may or may not know what those consist of; if you don't, they're essentially the &quot;I Spy&quot; books in video game form. You're given a list of objects to find in a picture\/scene, and all you need to do is find, or rather, click on them. The hidden object scenes generally looked great in Tibetan Quest, and the objects were quite hard to find sometimes. However, one small complaint that I do have with these scenes is that many of the objects are reused multiple times, like &quot;stars&quot;, &quot;hearts&quot;, etc.<br><br>The story of the game consists of you, a middle-aged woman, traveling to Tibet to rescue your niece after she mysteriously disappears during a trip there. As the game progresses, you slowly discover what the villain's motive is through some of the minigames, which I thought was pretty clever. The game doesn't dump exposition on you either; the focus is definitely on the gameplay, which is quite nice. Sure, the story may not be anything particularly special, but it gets the job done. There was also an extra bonus chapter that I didn't really check out much, though I believe it explains what happens after the game's initial ending, so that's pretty neat to see as most games don't expand upon their endings.<br><br>Visually, it's an Artifex Mundi game for sure, even if this one isn't developed by them. By it being an Artifex Mundi game, I mean that it looks great! They somehow never cease to impress me with the high quality, polish, and general attention to detail given to both areas and hidden object scenes in their games. On top of that, Tibetan Quest even features some fairly action-packed cutscenes involving a dragon trying to stop our heroine from rescuing her daughter. Sure, some of the effects (like the explosions) are a little silly and perhaps not the best quality, but overall it was still quite nice to see that the game tried to add some variety to its visuals.<br><br>Though, that does lead me to another minor complaint I have with the game - the facial animations. There's only a few times when talking to characters is necessary to progress, but whenever I had to talk to someone I couldn't help but laugh when I watched their faces move. The faces look fairly realistic, so when the only thing that moves is their mouths it looks a bit silly. I kind of found it charming though, so it wasn't too big of a deal for me, and thus, only a minor complaint.<br><br>By this point, you may have realized that I'm not criticizing the game much, and that's because it's simply hard to criticize! If you're not a fan of HOGs, this may not be the game for you, though if you enjoy adventure games, puzzle games, or just casual games in general I think you may really enjoy Tibetan Quest.

This game has points going for it and then it has also quite a few against it. Overall I really can't say that I disliked it, but that's about as positive as I feel about it.<br><br>The presentation is good. The graphics are colourful and well done, the animations are awkward as in most hidden object games, the music is nice and the voice acting isn't awful. Some locations feel 'shoehorned' into the Tibetian setting though, but overall it doesn't break the immersion.<br><br>There are quite a few hidden object scenes, so if you like those this game is definately for you. The inventory puzzles are rather weak with quite a few feeling really forced. A few examples: You have a magical staff that can shoot fire, but in order to melt some block of ice you have to use a magnifying glass. There is a huge lizard blocking your way and you have a bucket full of sleeping potion, but you rather use the bucket of sleeping potion on the ground under a spider in order to make the spider fall asleep. You need to put a lantern next to a rock and use a flint to light it up even if there are lit candles very near. The list goes on and it really gets on your nerves after a while. The minigames aren't bad, but they are either really easy (match the shape\/colour) or quite difficult.<br><br>Overall the game offers a couple of hours of hidden object game play, but if you are more into casual adventures that make at least some sense then this game might disappoint you. Certainly one of the weaker Artifex Mundi games and I can only recommend it in a sale or a bundle.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22314870', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22314870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22314870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22314870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22314870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22314870', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22314870_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22314870_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22310290\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeHeImSiNnIgE\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"58839200\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c6f64ec679dc92c50725615d9f5fc569248b96bf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c6f64ec679dc92c50725615d9f5fc569248b96bf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c6f64ec679dc92c50725615d9f5fc569248b96bf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeHeImSiNnIgE\/\" data-miniprofile=\"58839200\">LadeeApocalypse\u2122<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeHeImSiNnIgE\/games\/?tab=all\">908 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeHeImSiNnIgE\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeHeImSiNnIgE\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat can I say. This game had me gripped from start to finish. So much so, I ended up playing it through twice which I like to do for most HOG games. The artwork and the music fitted well with the game and the story and I found the monsters and creatures along the way very refreshing. There are alot of hidden object scenes which I don't mind at all but I would prefer there to be not so many in the game. That said, they fitted in perfectly with the puzzles and this balanced it all out for me. The only drawback I have with the game is the lack of people and voice acting. I love games where I am put into something and have to work my way out of it so although there was a map and hints, I found it quite challenging at times to know what to do next. <br><br>The game is a good length and it kept my attention and I would recommend it to any HOG fans out there or for people who enjoy doing puzzles. Artifex Mundi always have a variety of interesting puzzles in their games and although they can't take all the credit as only being publishers of this game, you could see that they put their stamp on it. <br><br>A very enjoyable game which is very good value for the price with it being a collector's edition. A huge success for me.<br><br>Roll on the next one!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22310290', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22310290' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22310290\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22310290' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22310290\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22310290', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22310290_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22310290_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22575778\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">Usagi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/games\/?tab=all\">2,099 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/\">141 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGo on a magical adventure to Tibet as you journey after your niece who has gone missing. What may seem like a simple endeavor soon becomes very complicated as you are <b>dragged into the battle for Shangri-La<\/b>. Discover hidden mysteries and explore ancient ruins as you battle angry ghosts of the past. <i>Tibetan Quest Beyond the World's End<\/i> is a beautiful hidden item game that offers a great casual experience with an engaging story and hours of gameplay. <br><br>Despite your misgivings your niece has gone on an exploration mission to Tibet with her lover which soon turns out poorly when you receive a letter saying that they\u2019ve gone missing. <b>The only way to do something right is to do it yourself<\/b> so you head out in search of them. You soon find yourself in a world of magic as you race after the villain responsible for the current mess and end up uncovering the mysteries of Shangri-La. The story mixes ancient mythologies with regular people making it easy to step into the shoes of the main character. However, the story barely has anything to do with Tibet and seems very Westernized. I would go so far as to say the location of the game actual means nothing as the game doesn\u2019t capitalize at all on Tibetan culture or its people as most characters in the game aren\u2019t even Tibetan. I found that the story of the game was the weakest aspect of this title.<br><br>The game plays as a point and click game with hidden object scenes and puzzles as well. The mouse is used to move around as well as interact with objects, some of which you can collect for your inventory to be used later. The game is filled with hidden object scenes, however most offer a list of objects to find in the scene. The tutorial says that there will be other types, like a list of shadows offered only, however these don\u2019t show up at all. Only in the bonus chapter were any different types of hidden item scenes provided. I didn\u2019t mind this, however, it felt a bit misleading that game said there would be variety but there was little there. <b>The puzzles are good<\/b>; Though their difficulty ranges from very easy to just frustrating, most were pretty simple.<br><br>The artwork in the game is beautiful, with vibrant colors and lovely depictions of Tibet. So lovely that at times I felt bad that the character you play seemed to just destroy things to progress in the story, namely statues. However, that is a minor issue, what I disliked the most were the character models. Their bodies were fine however all of <b>their faces were very weird<\/b>. It almost seemed like they tried to use real life references of people but they all ended up very warped. The speaking animation also seemed weird and all of the characters has soulless eyes. The music on the other hand was lovely and very fitting of the story.<br><br><i>Tibetan Quest Beyond the World's End<\/i> is a good hidden object game, it does pretty much everything right. I personally wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the story and didn\u2019t find it very engaging however everything else about the game is fine. It has plenty of hidden object scenes and only some are revisited twice, the puzzles were fine and visually it was a good game. Despite not being very much into the story I enjoyed playing it and <b>recommend it to fans of the genre<\/b>.

There's even a kind of Sokoban puzzle. :)<br><br>The collectibles would be fun to collect if the map would indicate scenes that had any still. As it is, I'd need a guide to not miss any, and that would just distract from the game (and thus ruin my enjoyment).<br><br>Concerning the story, this time it's an aunt looking for a missing niece.

First of all the face animation is not good, also I'm pretty sure this is not Tibet but anything can happen in games, its a fantasy world since using magic staff seems to be pretty normal for the protagonist.<br><br>The story wasn't strong, it wasn't the thing that kept me playing the game, in fact it wasn't interesting at all however the visuals and the artwork of the game was amazing although it wasn't accurate. I also encountered a bug that didn't count one of the achievements on steam (Detective Supreme)it appeared only in game, however after getting the last achievement in game and steam, that missing achievement popped up on steam in the same time which was strange. <br><br>Pros:<br>+Nice graphics.<br>+Music is OK, but extremely repetitive, there is one music for the hidden objects scenes, one for the mini games, and another one for each area you visit.<br>+Fast travel map but they prevent you from going back to the areas you've finished, they lock it.<br>+Collectibles.<br>+Easy achievements.<br>+Steam achievements.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Very short game.<br>-No replay value.<br>-Not interesting story.<br>-Puzzles are very easy and I've seen them in other games.<br>-Hidden objects scenes are extremely easy.<br>-Useless journal and notes.<br><br><br>Did I enjoy it? Umm no, do I recommend it? Yes and no!

Plus I love dragons a lot. Seeing all these dragons in one HOG I liked a lot.<br><br>To be honest the only thing thst was strange about this HOG are the items u pick. U pick up so many pick axes. I think u also pick up a lot of matched too. Why not just keep one the whole time with u. Than the ice with the magnifying glass was stupid, U had a sceptor on u that can melt ice. Nope u have to use the magnifying to melt the ice not a sceptor that can melt ice for u. Then the part with the spider where u have to get a bucket and put the sleeping powder in. Then what do u do? U actually throw that on the ground and hope the spider gets to that spill. I'm pretty sure there is a better way to get rid of that spider&gt;-&lt;<br><br>One thing I also liked a lot. Some of the puzzles u solve the animals come alive. I found that really cool. In the beginning of the ga,e the first puzzle with an animal on it. When solving the puzzle it sure surprised me when the animal became alive LOL.<br><br>There is a map with fast travel both very usful in the game,<br><br>The main game continues in the bonus content. I enjoyed playing the bonus content. I just wish the bonus content was longer as I felt it was too short,<br><br>Other than the weird items part on this HOG I recommend playing this HOG.

The title was sounding so good and than this comes. The story is okay. The graphics could be better, but for a small studio they are good. The locations could be a bit better, more mountains, more hidden secrets, more mysterious for seeing Shanri La. The sound is okay, too. Wait for a good discount like 2-3,5 Euros , over 3,5 \u20ac it would be to much money. There could be much more achievements for difficulty, find objects, bonus chapter and beat parts but its fine. I give this game for Hidden Object Gamers 70 %, for normal gamers maybe 53 %. Dont forget its published by Artifex but not developed.

I always appreciate the beautiful stories and atmosphere as well as the enjoyable puzzles and hideen object mini-games. The puzzles in this particular game weren't too difficult or frustrating in any way, they all clicked rather easily, which I appreciate in games I sit down and play to relax. There are too many point-and-click adventure games out there where I just have NO idea what the game wants me to do and I didn't feel that way at all here!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24980359', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24980359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24980359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24980359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24980359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24980359', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24980359_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24980359_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24444617\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Menace-123\/recommended\/427550\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"120458917\">Menace123<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t- This review isn't written by a native speaker, thank you for your understanding \u2013<br>- If you haven't found this review helpful or if you have found a mistake please leave a comment below -<br>- Note1 : I got this game during some IndieGala sales on the store  for about $2.50 \u2013 <br>- Note2 : Perfect means getting all of the achievements in the main story (there are achievements for the bonus story) - <br><br><u><b>Family Rating<\/b><\/u> <br>Everyone (12+)<br><u><b>Rating<\/b><\/u> <br>Between Good and Must play<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">- Key features below ---- Review after -----------------------------------------------<\/div><br><u><b>Play time needed (perfect)<\/b><\/u><br>About 3 hours (and about an extra half an hour for the bonus story)<br> <u><b>Gaming level<\/b><\/u><br>Casual<br><u><b>Achievement level<\/b><\/u><br>Casual <br><u><b>Game style<\/b><\/u><br>Point N\u2019 Click (First person), Hidden Objects (HO), Puzzle<br><u><b>Game modes<\/b><\/u><br>Story mode, Bonus Story mode<br><u><b>Graphics<\/b><\/u><br>Between Good and Very good.<br><u><b>Story<\/b><\/u><br>Between Mixed and Fine.<br><u><b>Playthrough<\/b><\/u><br>One (Two if you missed anything)<br><u><b>Voice<\/b><\/u><br>Good.<br><u><b>Music<\/b><\/u><br>Good.<br><u><b>Controls<\/b><\/u><br>Mouse only.<br><u><b>Tutorial<\/b><\/u><br>Yes.<br><u><b>Unmissable \/ backtracking content<\/b><\/u><br>No. Refer to the (*) point at the end.<br><u><b>Glitches \/ bugs<\/b><\/u><br>None.<br><u><b>Size<\/b><\/u><br>About 1300 Mo<br><u><b>Worth price<\/b><\/u><br>You should buy it with a discount If you accept the (*) point at the end, the story and its length.

(And I think there is no (or perhaps a few) Tibetan written characters in the whole game?)<br>The main line of the story is fine but you need to be aware of some surrealistic parts. As a middle-aged aunty you\u2019ll wear a ninja suit upon her arrival in Tibet. You\u2019ll discover an artifact: a magical wand that uses the power of different gems to cast a spell. Sometimes you\u2019ll keep the gem and the wand separately and sometimes the gem will disappear\u2026 When you\u2019ll use the artifact, you\u2019ll some part of your ninja suit. Finally, you\u2019ll encounter some surrealistic puzzles. : like using the wand or even helping a local man to find a plant he looks for. (which is next to his house)<br><br>Despite all of that the story is still fine. (at least for me) So here is a short description of the story of the steam store : When you were seeing off your beloved niece three weeks ago as she embarked on an archeological trip to Tibet, nothing could have foreshadowed the dramatic events that were about to unfold. Only yesterday you received a mysterious letter from which you learned that Larisa and her crew had gotten lost in a snow storm. Without hesitation you leave your family estate to come to your prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s rescue. The inhabitants of Lhasa's Tibetan temple guide you toward the legendary city of Shangri-La where Larisa and her expedition were last seen.<br><br>As every Artifex Mundi game you can move freely in different area (Tibet or Shangri-La) and need to solve some puzzles and find all objects in hidden objects scenes. The game has 3 different difficulties and a guest feature: every one of the family can play an independent save and resume the game where they left it. When you first play the game you\u2019ll have a notebook where you have all your objectives as well as all your notes. You also have a map to not get lost and you may be able to fast travel with it too. Adding to that you\u2019ll have a hint button that will help you in many ways but be warned that you may not use it in any puzzle or hidden object scene (HOS) or investigation scene (IS). Hints can be used to know where you need to go, where is the next interaction or to show an object or clue in an HOS or IS or to skip a puzzle. To conclude this part, you\u2019ll also have an inventory to store useful items through your journey.<br><br>Puzzles are good and different. You\u2019ll mainly encounter the classical hidden objects scenes (HOS) with a brand new feature! (which I\u2019ll talk later) As a classical HOS you need to find hidden objects with the help of their name. Colored names mean that you have to interact directly with the scene or use an item in the scene. There is also a few HOS with the shapes instead of the names. As far as I remember there is only one for the main story and two for the bonus story. For the bonus story there is one HOS with shapes that you need to use in order to get the final item.<br><br>As some other Artifex Mundi game : <br><br>\u2022\tYou\u2019ll have to find collectibles scattered across the game. There are: medallions, apples, swords and stars. You\u2019ll find them in that order in a distinct area. Medallions for the first area, apples for the second\u2026 You\u2019ll be able to track the amount of each kind you found in a sub-menu. When you\u2019ve found every items of a kind you\u2019ll restore one fourth of a bonus background.<br>\u2022\tYou\u2019ll be able to play mahjong rather than the HOS. (Not recommended if you play for the achievements)<br><br>One of the very good thing of this game is that there are 3 unique features you won\u2019t find in any other Artifex Mundi game (except some games) :<br><br>\u2022\tIn almost every classical HOS you\u2019ll have some morphing objects.<br>\u2022\tAbout 10 slideshow puzzles talking about Shangri-La.<br>\u2022\tA boss fighting puzzle.<br><br>A Morphing object: is an object \u201cswap\u201d between two distinct items in a defined timeframe. One example of a morphing object is an item that will swap between an apple and a pomegranate every 5 seconds.  You\u2019ll know when you\u2019ll need to find a morphing object by looking carefully at the list. Indeed, when the required object is hidden (alternate object) the name will be colored and when it\u2019s shown the name will be white as usual.<br><br>During the game you\u2019ll encounter several time a book on a pedestal: opening the book will trigger a slideshow puzzle in several waves. The aim is to find 3 hidden and misplaced pieces and to place them in the right spot. Each slideshow solved let you know a little more about Shangri-La.<br><br>Finally, at the end of the main story you\u2019ll face a boss in a unique puzzle mostly based on memory and speed. You\u2019ll need to memorize the right order of colored balls light (like a SIMON game) and after you\u2019ll need to dodge on the right side. You can\u2019t have a game-over : you\u2019ll only be beaten by the boss until you succeed.<br><br> (*) : <br><br>In addition to not skip (not use mahjong too) or use any hint while playing every puzzles and Hidden objects scenes, there are a few more missable achievements. One obvious one is the tutorial, you can follow it until its end: it won\u2019t ask you to play the mahjong game. Two achievements ask you to finish a puzzle or a HOS in one minute. Two others require you to find 3 items within 3 seconds or 5 items within 5 seconds. Another obvious achievement need you to watch all cut scene without skipping them.<br><br>Finally, the last achievements ask you to find every collectible of the game. So for them I suggest you to follow a guide on steam.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24444617', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24444617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24444617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24444617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24444617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24444617', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24444617_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24444617_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/427550\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 81 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22441408","22487099","25169248","22353050","22604490","22314870","22310290","22575778","25077522","22435224"]}
