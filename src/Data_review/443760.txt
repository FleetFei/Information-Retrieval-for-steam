There's no flashy graphics, alien invasions, or apocalyptic scenarios.  It doesn't spend a bunch of screen time ratcheting up false tensions, piling on mountains of expository dialogue, or following predictable movie tropes.  The &quot;hook&quot; is presented with an unapologetic lack of explanation.  The viewer is thrown into the chaos alongside the characters trying to piece it all together.  This is smart sci-fi and a great character-driven thriller.  <br><br>Multiple viewings are encouraged and rewarded.  I've seen it several times and I've loved it more each time.  There are lots of little details that might be missed on a first viewing which have profound implication upon subsequent viewings, such as one character's quick glance at an object in the room or a line spoken off camera that is barely registered the first time around.  I won't ruin the plot in this review and suggest going into this film knowing as little as possible.  It's interesting piecing it all together and if you love it as I did, you'll want to watch it again and again to pick up on all the subtle details.  I had a bunch of &quot;oh sh-t!&quot; moments on my third viewing once I started paying really close attention.<br><br>The way it was filmed is also really interesting.  This is an indie film with a $50k budget shot on Canon 5D's.  It was filmed at the director's own house over the course of 5 nights with only pair of cameras, a skeleton crew, and completely natural lighting.  The most interesting thing is that the acting is entirely improv.  The actors had no scripts.  They didn't know the story ahead of time.  It was filmed like a mystery dinner party, with the actors staying in-character, and the director as master of ceremonies pulling strings behind the curtain.  Before each scene the actors received a small sheet of notes directing them as to what their character should accomplish.  He left it in the actors' hands to craft the scene, only pausing to &quot;right the ship&quot; when they starting veering too far off course.  What we get from this are natural conversations and genuine characters while the actors work together to craft a coherent story.  They're figuring it all out as they go along, just like the audience.  It's a fun way to create a film, certainly too risky in the big-budget space, but it really works here to create a compelling, refreshing experience.<br><br>I have a couple gripes with the Steam version.  It appears this film is only currently available at a maximum of 544p resolution.  The store page suggests 720p and proper 1080p options are available, as listed in the recommended system requirements, but these options were not present at my time of viewing.  I've also viewed this film on Amazon Prime Video and it has a 1080p option, so it shouldn't be a matter of availability of an HD source.<br><br>Also, some scenes are particularly dark due to filming outdoors at night and using only natural lighting sources.  This causes some issues with color banding and artifacting in low-light scenes, which is only made worse by the non-HD resolution.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22239231', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22239231' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22239231\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22239231' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22239231\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22239231', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22239231_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22239231_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21697983\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jushnl\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"112656255\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c25b5ebcfb6f5db2a3bcc0d554314bdfeafd6cca.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c25b5ebcfb6f5db2a3bcc0d554314bdfeafd6cca.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c25b5ebcfb6f5db2a3bcc0d554314bdfeafd6cca_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jushnl\/\" data-miniprofile=\"112656255\">jush<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jushnl\/games\/?tab=all\">438 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jushnl\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jushnl\/recommended\/443760\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHaven't ever dabbled in the movie seciton of Steam, and was a little reluctant about this one. Although after watching the trailer, and considering their weren't any negative reviews of it on steam (as of yet), I chose to wing it.<br><br>It's a pretty gripping mystery-sci-fi movie revolving around a group of friends who get together for dinner on the night of a comet's passing. What starts as a semingly friendly dinner, with playful banter, turns into a heated intergation and battle for explanation to determine what's goingon  in their seemingly ordinary neighborhood. This movie takes direct inspiration from the thought experiment of &quot;Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat&quot;, except where there is no cat, but people. Instead of a vial of poison, it's their personalities and consciousness.<br><br>I'd have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought their take on &quot;Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat&quot; was interesting, and it's execution was okay. The acting succeded my expections for an indie movie on Steam, and I felt the actors played their characters genuinely. It defintiely held my attention throughout the whole movie, and the ending left me wanting more.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21697983', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21697983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21697983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21697983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21697983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21697983', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21697983_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21697983_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/443760\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 2 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22239231","21697983"]}
