Especially since it was made by only one person, and a musician. It won't blow your mind, but it's really solid.<br><br>It's simple looking, but each weapon has a different color, creating some pretty great light effects. The fact that it's not low-res helps it quite a lot to stand out as well.<br>The enemy design is my favourite part. While there's effectively only one design (with some changes between each type), it gives the game a lot of personality.<br><br>The player character, allies and turrets also look pretty cool. It's more modern that you would expect from an indie game.<br><br>The only problem with it is that, when there are many enemies and allies close to you, all shooting at each other at once, the game gets a bit frame-y, and the explosion obfuscate everything else. Your best bet is to just stand back, otherwise you'll be hit by a lot of hidden bullets.<br><br>Everything is also <b>color-coded<\/b>. From the enemies to the weapons, its color will determine its effects, like piercing, explosive-damage, life-steal, etc. This leads to the next aspect: interface.<br><br>The interface is simple and functional, I like it. However, the loading screens and the way it teaches you these mechanics is a bit of a problem, to me.<br><br>During the loading screens, you're presented with leaflet-esque presentations with the colors, story or enemies explained. While they're pretty neat, visually, it's still a screen with paragraphs of text, which is definitely not ideal to teach a game's mechanics. <br>Regardless, I don't think it plays a huge part in actually playing it, and you'll learn what you need in the first battles.<br><br>The <b>sound-effects<\/b> were pretty standard, nothing noteworthy. Still, whenever an enemy died or you destroyed a crystal, a sound played, giving you good feedback.<br>The <b>music<\/b> wasn't bad at all, although it was a bit... generic, I guess. The musicians is clearly talented, so it would have been nice to have something a bit more unique. Also, it doesn't loop very well, and it's pretty short, so you're very likely to hear the wrong looping every level.<br><br><br><b><u>Structure &amp; Mechanics' Overview<\/u><\/b><br>There are two modes: Battle and Campaign. The <b>campaign<\/b> is basically progressively more difficult battles, with a progression system added to it. The <b>battles<\/b> lose a lot for not having any progression. They take 5-10 minutes at most, so it's not like a Binding of Isaac, where there's progression in each battle. Not at all. You can pick a few power-ups, buy a few droids, but it's almost meaningless, since they're so short.<br><br>However, these battles serve two purposes: as a <b>tutorial, and difficulty measurement<\/b>. Before you unlock the campaign, you'll have to play a few battles, first. This is basically to teach you the general mechanics before jumping into it. Aside from that, it's seeing how well you do, and deciding the campaign's starting difficulty.<br><br>I've done more battles than necessary, and finished the campaign 2 or 3 times, so you can see that it's very short.<br><br>Let's now talk about the <b>weapons<\/b>. As I've mentioned, there are specialized <b>effects<\/b> that are color coded. These will basically determine what weapons you'll want to carry with you, for the different situations. Usually, I took one with slowing, one with life-steal, and one with explosive-damage. But there are some other choices, that I won't detail.<br>Aside from these effects, and during the campaign, there are also <b>attributes<\/b>.<br><br>These include rate of fire, size, accuracy, and homing. There are 4 or 5 ranks to each, and the price for the upgrades increase the more you buy.<br><br>You'll also be able to pick weapons in power-up form, that you can switch between, and also upgrade. These have a decent variety, because of the stats and effects combinations. However, the game has a tendency to overwhelm you with these. By the end, you can have 10+ weapons that you have no use for (1).<br><br>The <b>enemies<\/b> also have different weapons, with these characteristics. Also, some are faster, some are more deadly, tankier, etc. Visually, they have a similar base design (with differences in size and form), but you can generally distinguish well between them. <br><br><br>In each battle, you start at your base, and then have to go underground to destroy every crystal and enemy. Your base, if not under attack, will heal you, and restore your energy. Energy depletes when you shoot.<br>You can also buy <b>Droids<\/b> and <b>Turrets<\/b>, in the base. These rank up, becoming more powerful as they kill enemies. Turrets are stationary, and just for base defense. Droids can go with you, or stay defending the base.<br><br>Droids are basic units that will follow you around and shoot everything they see. They'll also be in front of your character, tanking the damage.<br><br>If your character dies, you'll have to control a droid, and go underground to the place you died, and ressurect. You'll ressurect  with as much energy and HP as you had (or, well, very little). This plays an important part about difficulty, which I'll talk about later (2).<br><br>There's a bit issue with these droids, which is their path-finding. The maps are randomly generated in squares, with lots of intersections. Your allies VERY easily get stuck in those, and you'll have to manually do a dance to get them out. If you don't, they'll simply be reset back to base. This is really <b>annoying<\/b>. In some levels, as you'll have to constantly go back and forth...<br><br>The <b>power-ups<\/b> are quite varied to. They include shields (for you or your minions), helper weapons, ranks, energy, etc. There's one particular power-up that's awesome: it's gives you the ability to basically <b>phase<\/b> through the walls, slowly losing HP. This lets you go around enemies, escape more easily, etc., giving you more strategical choice. Unfortunately, there aren't that many situations where you can use it appropriately, and it's the only power-up with a cool ability.<br><br>I think this is enough. Now, to talk about the 2 major points about this game, for me.<br><br><u><i>1.Weapons<\/i><\/u><br>They are indeed randomly generated, but there's one big problem: they all feel exactly the same. There isn't any mechanical quirk to any of the weapons, and every element is merely numerical. Faster rate, more damage, spread shot, etc. <br>It's unfortunate. However, if they actually felt different (in a different game, I guess) it would be much more interesting. Perhaps an overheating laser, or a manually reloaded Shotgun, etc. Then, each type of weapon could have its own stats and progression. <br>Just my 2 cents. In the end, they all feel the same weapon, in this game, which defeats the point of random generation, a bit. <br><br><u><i>2. Difficulty<\/i><\/u><br>While the procedural generation does what it promises, the game is still far too easy. I didn't have any issues, with the exception of the last campaign level, and because of a very specific reason. It's basically a big room with lots of huge enemies. If you die, you'll fall to the bottom. And then, getting yourself out is a pain in the \u2665\u2665\u2665, because you're bombarded from every direction...<br>Aside from that, it's too easy, and you just need to be careful, with certain enemies.<br><br><b><u>Conclusion<\/u><\/b><br>This review may sound overly negative, but being critical doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the game! It's actually pretty good, <i>for what it is<\/i>. Sure, it's limited and byte-sized, but it's a fun experiment, for a couple of hours.

Adaptable difficulty, randomly created maps, upgradeable weapons, and multiple playstyles. The core game starts out tactical but can turn into a power trip with some careful upgrade choices. With that said, simply bumping up the difficulty(via Battle Mode) or hinder your upgrades will create a truly difficult experience. <br><br>I saw a few reviews condemn the shorter campaign length I thought it fit with the overall idea of the game. The game has a fantastic pick up and play mentality that seeps into the campaign as well as emphasis is placed on replaying the game. Taken straight from the store page, &quot;[Koya Rift] is built around circular, adaptive gameplay that emphasizes replay value.&quot; As a parent I don't have several hours to drop into a game anymore. Being able to play a quick session here and there fits into my lifestyle so much better than longer sessions and the quick campaign means I can actually finish the game in a reasonable time frame. <br><br>There are a couple of bugs but the developer is active in the Steam Discussions and says they are being worked on.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12814952', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12814952' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12814952\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12814952' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12814952\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12814952', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12814952_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12814952_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14103347\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sugarypolecat\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"29267304\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e695ae4d33c4a5b5c19c33f2fd67e2437e417d6d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e695ae4d33c4a5b5c19c33f2fd67e2437e417d6d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e695ae4d33c4a5b5c19c33f2fd67e2437e417d6d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sugarypolecat\/\" data-miniprofile=\"29267304\">SugaryPoleCat<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sugarypolecat\/games\/?tab=all\">845 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sugarypolecat\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sugarypolecat\/recommended\/328990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 21, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tREASON FOR WHY I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IS AT THE BOTTOM OF MY REVIEW, SO IF YOU THINK IT'S TL:DR, SCROLL DOWN PLEASE.<br><br><br>This game is... boring. No really. Almost no challenge at all, only the last mission was in the campaign was kind of difficult, as it had two gigantic bosses guarding the last Phantom Stone (if I remember correctly) and they take A LOT of punishment. The rest of the missions are easy. The battles aren't really that special. Why? Because you do the exact same thing in the campaign missions and in those Battle Mode stages. At least each time you win a stage in Battle Mode the difficulty increases, so that's good.<br><br>I just can't get over the music. The fu***g music. I'm not a music 'PRO', but even I recognise the samples from FL Studio (at least they sound like FL Studio, I may be wrong though). It feels like it's rap**g my ears. It's dreadful. Like... someone just started up FL Studio or whatever program you use, played around with the samplers, showed it to a friend, friend said: &quot;Hell yeah! It's amazing! We will make like GAZILLION OF DOLLARS for this!&quot; and then they put it in this game. Best solution: mute the game, open up MusicBee\/Winamp\/Foobar\/Spotify (iTunes is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, deal with it) and put Metallica or some other metal band. It will make your experience at least 30% more awesome. Don't worry, you won't miss out on the SFX (Sound Effects) as almost all of them sound the same and unintresting. Just your general 'laser' sound effects.<br><br>The game gives you option to find useful bonus orbs which TRUST ME: are actually useful. The 'More Energy' bonus orb doesn't make a noticeable difference however. It's more about exploring the caves to find those orbs as they are kind of essential: you can get new weapons from them, shields, reinforcements, drone shields and helper guns. <br>It also gives you an option to collect money and build towers to protect your Pod or purchase Drones which I found more helpful than the Towers, as the drones can move and if they get damaged, they will automatically return to the Pod and they will stay there defending the pod, until you decide to return to the surface and order them to follow you. Yes, you can order your drones to stay at the Pod, or come with you. Their pathfinding however is not so brilliant really. They get stuck often. Very often. <br>I do like that this game gives you an array of weapons to choose from. However... they all feel the same. The 'Redder' guns are supposed to be slower and do more damage than the 'Blue..er...' ones, but... it's such a slight difference it's BARELY noticeable. Okay, yes, the red guns have explosive effects and blue guns freeze enemies. Nontheless they feel the same. That is, until you discover that they have different perks like piercing, which goes through many enemies. Or scatter, which is basically the 'S' powerup from Contra for your guns. This was a VERY welcoming feature. I liked it. It felt like a mini-borderlands gun po*n thing, though not as exciting. Also, this game has BULLET PHYSICS. BUT. And it's a big butt (pun intended)... it's not about your usual bullet stuff: how long it travels before it starts stalling and lose it's potential. No. It's more like Call of Kaka bullet spread. You know: you shoot straight, but somehow your bullets come out of your barrel at unreal angles... and also how good they are at ballet. Seriously, it feels like some of these guns are firing sparkling\/glowing ballerinas... at unreal angles.<br><br><br><br><br>SO WHY DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?<br>(I'm too lazy to do formatting things and spell-check. It's late, I'm sick with flu and tired after working for 14 hours. Yes, 14, from 6 AM to 8 PM. I'm gonna... crawl into my blanket and pretend I'm a hotdog and just... fall asleep...)<br><br>Because it's cheap. 3,99 Euros. That's like... 6 USD or 3 Pounds if you are British. <br>So don't expect anything like 'FTL' for this price. The game LOOKS cool and fresh, but it just isn't. You can play similar games on Kongregate and Newgrounds FOR FREE, because this kind of thing (defend your base, while exploring some area) has been done in Flash plenty of times. This game DOES stand out from them, as it introduces bullet physics, which I think is a welcoming thing. It feels like... it's a missed potential. This game could be so much more, so much better, if they didn't try to make it like a Flash game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14103347', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14103347' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14103347\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14103347' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14103347\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14103347', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14103347_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14103347_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15883308\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ITHAQUACANADA\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"142824995\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/70\/707a8faff42f89f4ccf6e2249981daf0f1fc88a4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/70\/707a8faff42f89f4ccf6e2249981daf0f1fc88a4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/70\/707a8faff42f89f4ccf6e2249981daf0f1fc88a4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ITHAQUACANADA\/\" data-miniprofile=\"142824995\">Ithaqua<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ITHAQUACANADA\/games\/?tab=all\">1,866 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ITHAQUACANADA\/recommended\/\">333 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ITHAQUACANADA\/recommended\/328990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is obviously a iOS PTW game.
