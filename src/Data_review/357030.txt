For those of you who may not know, Kasedo Games is the digital first division of Kalypso Media who are famous for among other things their fantastic Tropico franchise. Among their other titles are Imperium Romanum Gold Edition, Skydrift, Crookz \u2013 The Big Heist and many more. Therefore, before I even had an opportunity to sit down and play the game I had reason to be quietly confident that I would be presented with a potentially great new indie title.<br><br>After playing for a sufficient number of hours to experience the game and to be in a position to review prior to release I have to admit that I was not disappointed. Fans of the tower defense and bullet hell genres will rejoice when they get their opportunity to play Excubitor.  It manages to marry the combination of the two genres perfectly together to create an exciting title that is bursting at the seams with action but providing a significant chunk of strategy as well.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">PROS<\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tight gameplay: The action is fast and furious. Players will be roaming across the map building turrets while also using their Hammerhead to destroy enemy ships. Players will need to become highly proficient at tower design and controlling their craft in order to succeed. Both are equally pivotal to your success throughout the game. Players really cannot choose to forego one over the other given the enemies have a multitude of different pathways in which to attack you and your base and everything happens simultaneously across various points of the map.<br><\/li><li>Great boss battles: The boss battles are some of the best that I have come across in either the tower defense or bullet hell genres. Fast action and even quicker thinking are the rule of the game here. Each boss has different strengths and weaknesses so the player will have to discover what they are as soon as possible if they are to avoid an otherwise inevitable death. Each boss had me thinking hard and sitting at the edge of my seat as I discovered methods to defeat them.<br><\/li><li>Variety leading to increased replayability: If you thought that the only strategy occurred during the actual battles think again. There are important choices to be made between combat rounds. This includes the weapons and the modules that you choose to upgrade your ship with. Each of the 17 upgradeable weapons has strengths and weaknesses that can determine the outcome of an entire battle. As too will the choice of modules \u2013 whether you upgrade shields, armour, weapons, etc. The choice is yours but make the right ones. In game you have 9 turrets that like the weapons and modules of your ship unlock as the game progresses. There is a ton of variety in the game which allows you to try different strategies increasing the amount of replayability of the game.<br><\/li><li>Very challenging: The game has been expertly designed to make it challenging yet extremely fair. There are four difficulty levels as well as a NewGame+ mode which as expected is even more difficult.<br><\/li><li>Solid amount of content with room for expansion: Excubitor lends itself well to future DLC in the form of additional levels, weapons, turrets and more. The game comes packed with 4 different areas each containing a number of levels before you get to the end boss fight. Given the vast replayability on top of a good amount of content the value \u2013 content proposition gets a solid tick.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CONS<\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Not very newbie friendly: The game starts off easy enough until you reach the boss fights. Then the difficulty spike is quite significant even at the most basic difficulty level. Veterans will rejoice in this fact yet newbies will be hard pressed to progress further into the game. They may find themselves frustrated at the complexity of the boss battles.<br><\/li><li>Sound: If there is something to be disappointed about in regards to the presentation of the game then it is in the sound department. I feel I am being petty here but there is no innovation in the sound department.<br><\/li><li>Basic UI: The user interface is a little on the basic side. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything superlative and it gets the job done but again its nothing that we haven\u2019t seen before. It doesn\u2019t need to be and again I am certain that many may feel as though I am being petty.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CONCLUSION<\/div><br>It\u2019s very rare for me to put a significant number of hours into a game before it is released to the public. I\u2019m not a huge fan of betas or early release games (not Early Access games that are purchasable by the general public). However, Steam credits me as having spent over 140 hours in the game as of writing. While there were periods where I was idle within the game I\u2019ve definitely spent over a hundred hours in the game (and reset achievements twice so as to show the game off to friends as new). That speaks volumes to the amount of enjoyment that I have already received from Excubitor.<br><br><br>For similar reviews, fantastic giveaways and our stellar community reviews please visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Steamified<\/a>.

As a standalone TD or shoot em up, this game wouldn't feel quite up to par - but the end result of hybridization plus plenty of upgrade-progression is surprisingly enjoyable.  <br><br>When two individually tasty items are combined, one of three things usually happens:<br><b>A.  Peanut Butter + Chocolate:<\/b>  <i> Woooo, it's better than either alone! The man inside the magical moving-picture-box told me that, so it MUST be true!<\/i> <br><b>B.  Bananas + Honey Mustard:<\/b>   <i>    ....No. Just no.<\/i> <br><b>C.  Pizza + Pineapples:<\/b>    <i> Huh.  I mean, the pineapple no longer tastes all fresh and juicy, the pizza loses some of its comforty garlicy goodness... and yet the end result somehow *works* in a strangely yummy way.  Well, usually...unless you're one of those pizza \/ pineapple purists, of course.<\/i> <br><br>Given the above method of simplifying the universe, Excubitor is firmly in category C.  The Tower Defense and Shoot-Em-Up parts of the game both seem to be lacking some of their usual appeal when considered individually, but still work strangely well together.<br><br><b> Excubitor as Tower Defense: <\/b><br>The tower defense gameplay initially seems rather unimpressive, as your towers never feel like they're really doing what they should (which is stopping enemy waves in their tracks).   The fixed points for building usually aren't strategically sound, the towers seem extremely weak, and even building towers can be a challenge when using a controller - (you have to target each tower build spot, with no close-enough lock on mechanism to aid you).   However, this should all be taken with a grain of salt:  the main point of tower-building in this game seems to be simply softening up foes juuust enough to take them down on your own.<br><br><b> Excubitor as Bullet Hell: <\/b><br>The shoot-em-up section is also rather flimsy when considered on its own merits.  As long as you continually strafe\/circle opponents, your ship is never in much danger from the enemies (they're mostly just trying to destroy your larger base at the center of the map), and even dying only costs you a few seconds to respawn with no real penalty.  You simply need to seek out clusters of enemies and destroy them before they have a chance to damage your central base too much.  <br><br>The exception to this lackadaisical shmup-action is the epic boss battles, which throw swarms of enemies at you and your base from all directions, while you try to not-die and protect your base at the same time, even as you discover the trick \/ weak-point of the boss which will allow you to win.  These boss battles are spectacular and extremely challenging on even the 'normal' difficulty, and will be much more satisfying to those who love bullet-hell games.<br><br><b>Excubitor as a TD-Shmup Hybrid: <\/b><br>Now this is where it gets interesting.  As previously mentioned, the towers in Excubitor aren't very strong, but they are still extremely necessary to successfully complete a mission - you can't guard the multitude of enemy paths all on your own.  Choosing the correct combination of towers thus becomes very important, as you want them to do at least a little damage to help thin the ranks, while also slowing\/stunning ships as they approach so that your base doesn't take too much damage before you can swoop in.<br><br>Of course, even building these towers isn't easy, because time spent flying to the build spots is time taken away from defending your base - and for some reason, the enemies don't feel like being good sports and giving you free time to build up your defenses to stomp them.  Further complications arise with bonus objectives on the map to destroy and environmental hazards you can activate to take out a chunk of enemies and give you some necessary breathing room.  And it all becomes doubly tricky when your home base feels like repositioning 'for reasons' and makes your old towers semi-useless.  All of this makes managing your time betwixt shooting and building a rather entertaining challenge. <br><br><b>Miscellaneous<\/b>:<br>I do feel the need to point out a couple of negatives to the game that don't directly relate to the gameplay, but may influence your decision to purchase the game.  <br><br>Currently, the audio is terrible.  Not merely mediocre, but full-out <b>'Is that really the game's audio, or did I accidentally stick a muffin in my ear again?'<\/b> awful.  The devs mentioned they're looking into it in the forums, so hopefully this will be fixed sooner or later - but for now you might as well put the game on mute.  <br><br>Another negative is the controls - the frantic shoot-em-up-gameplay calls for a controller, but said controller makes building towers and selecting menu items like upgrades needlessly complicated.  The game could use a little more controller love, as well as a soft-lock when clicking on tower building areas.<br><br><b> Conclusion <\/b>: <br>This big ol' pineapple pizza of a game will probably be loved by some and hated by others.  By combining TD and SHMUP game styles, Excubitor compromises some of the strengths of each of its roots - but it still makes for a surprisingly tasty hybrid concoction in the end.  Despite the weaknesses in the game, it's a heck of a lot of fun and an innovative combination of genres.

On one hand, you've got a game that does try a little bit of something different, and when it really opens up the level design with some new and interesting concepts and challenges, it really can bring the fun factor. The game has its moments of fun, where you get a new weapon to play with and you try something completely new. But it's also weighed down by some repetition, and a lack of oompf in terms of gameplay: nothing really strongly stands out in the genres in terms of mechanics in the end. And the game left with a little bit of motion sickness at times. <br><br>It's one of those games that will not make purists of the genre happy: there's little quirks here and there will all of its mechanics, and that's going to annoying some people, where the action of the shmup comes face to face with the slow strategy of tower defense. If you're a gamer that likes a game going off the beaten a path a bit, but still being in familiar territory, then this is worth a look. Otherwise, it's one of those titles that I'd wait for a sale on. <br><br><b>Video Review: <\/b>  <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ue6q0NbvsKs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/ue6q0NbvsKs<\/a><br><br><u> Lists: <\/u><br><b>Positives:<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> When the level design goes off the beaten path, it can be pretty fun, as you're dashing around, trying to juggle things before your big ship gets destroyed. <br><\/li><li> You'll have some fun, even in the repetition. It does have an addictive quality to it at times. <br><\/li><li> A good collection of weapons. Upgrades do make a reasonable difference, and the upgrades do make a reasonable difference.<br><\/li><li> Do like the strafing adding a bit of skill into the mix.<br><\/li><li> Controls seem a little bit different at first, and it does take some getting used to, but compared to other games out there, I did enjoy the challenge that it presented. But it's a hit or miss kind of option.<br><\/li><li> There's some nice details in the visuals. While they can clash at times, each art asset seems reasonable for what they are using here.<\/li><\/ul><br><b>Negatives:<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> It lacks oompf. This is in particular when attacking and hitting enemies and the sounds\/effects that play, it's just doesn't have that spark.<br><\/li><li> Sometimes, it feels like the choices of turrets really doesn't matter. This has to do with the fact that you really can make up for any weaknesses of your turrets in the end. <br><\/li><li> Difficulty on normal seems a little low. If you're a veteran of either genre, play on hard.<br><\/li><li> Really needed some better sound design. Turning off the sound, and I really didn't feel any gameplay differences. <br><\/li><li> Dying needed consequences. It does take a while to spawn, but it didn't cause that many problems.<br><\/li><li> This may be unique to me, so keep that in mind. But while playing, the 360 movement plus the visuals ended up making me a little bit motion sick. <\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23217939', 'summary' );

but the suprirising part is, it does.<br><br>The game puts you in control of a small fighter ship known as the Hammerhead. Using your ship to fly around the map you'll be abe to fight off incoming waves of enemy ships using deployable turrets. During missions you'll also need to protect a ship called Antares. If this ship is destroyed it's game over.<br><br>The game features 17 weapons in total and each of them has 3 upgrades for you to purchase in the armory. There are also a wide range of turrets available for you to construct as well. There are also points on the map that you'll be able to interact with that will often aid you in the game as well. These include factories that will mine resources, fans that will destroy any incoming enemies and many others to discover.<br><br>The game's control felt very fluid and the game was equally action packed. The game is also quite beautiful to look at as well. <br><br>I imagine the game won't be for everyone but it's definitely a fun (and challenging) game that will no doubt please fans of bullet hell games and tower defense games.<br><br>We decided to give the game 3.6 stars out of 5 in our review and since we liked the game we'll be giving it a recommendation here on Steam as well. <br><br>We also recorded a gameplay video which you can find below:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OLtCnSuK1O0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OLtCnSuK1O0<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23221768', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23221768' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23221768\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23221768' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23221768\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23221768', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23221768_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23221768_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23724704\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046594363\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"86328635\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d09d32ea0c548ea5645d62f28800175ed8346d99.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d09d32ea0c548ea5645d62f28800175ed8346d99.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d09d32ea0c548ea5645d62f28800175ed8346d99_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046594363\/\" data-miniprofile=\"86328635\">k0v4ch<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046594363\/games\/?tab=all\">658 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046594363\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046594363\/recommended\/357030\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWow, a great blend of classical shmup and tower defence.

The game has its moments of fun, where you get a new weapon to play with and you try something completely new. But it's also weighed down by some repetition, and a lack of oompf in terms of gameplay: nothing really strongly stands out in the genres in terms of mechanics in the end. <br><br>Different levels present different challenge which keeps you engaged and the choice of setting a turrent or a generator keeps you thinking.  When the level design goes off the beaten path, it can be pretty fun, as you're dashing around, trying to juggle things before your big ship gets destroyed. It does have an addictive quality to it at times. <br>A good collection of weapons. Upgrades do make a reasonable difference, so you have to manage that too. Do like the strafing adding a bit of skill into the mix.<br>Controls seem a little bit different at first, and it does take some getting used to. There's some nice details in the visuals. While they can clash at times, each art asset seems reasonable for what they are using here.<br><br>Sometimes, it feels like the choices of turrets really doesn't matter. This has to do with the fact that you really can make up for any weaknesses of your turrets in the end. <br>Difficulty on normal seems a little low. If you're a veteran of either genre, play on hard.<br><br>Excubitor is brilliant game with idea of tower defence and shoot em up in one package.
