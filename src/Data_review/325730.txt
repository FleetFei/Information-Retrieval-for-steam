I will add a TL;DR at the end.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay\t<\/div><br>You start off with a single worker and must build a Hive (your primary building) which allows you to construct more workers, a hive queen and eventually a medic. You will need to gather food to allow you to build more units. You must then construct a barracks to get your first fighting units; one melee, and one ranged. The melee unit comes in a pack of 6 while the ranged comes in a pack of 4. Resources are what allow you to build these building however food is vital. The game is nice but the camera controls seems off to me. The RPG aspect that the developer has added is fun but still unrefined along with the DNA aspect as we are never formally introduced with the features as of yet. On Act 4 the difficulty curve is immense right now and It is hard to beat as your enemies clearly outnumber you and are quick to strike in force. However, from what I know the developer is planning to add a turret type building and I can see the potential for this game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Graphics\/Sound\t<\/div><br>The graphics are nice and I do like how the Hive and the units are designed and displayed. I do wish that the enemies exact attack or amount of health would be displayed if possible. The scenery is nice to look at and the music is well-done.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros\/Cons\t<\/div><br> <b>Pros\t<\/b><br><br>+ shows potential <br>+ story is well-written and fun to play through<br>+ scenery is amazing<br>+ units are well designed<br>+ music is enjoyable<br>+ in discussions developer is happy to listen and reply to you<br><br> <b>Cons\t<\/b><br>**Note that since this game is currently in early access that most of these issues will be fixed when the game is done**<br><br>- options are locked down (cant click on them)<br>- camera controls are a bit slow <br>- huge difficulty curve currently existing in Act 4 (as more items will be added this level will of course become easier but as of now huge curve)<br>- RPG and DNA are not explained early on even though they are available from Act 1<br>- Intro still does not make sense and instead of introducing the insectoids we find out about humans (currently not in the game but will be added later)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Suggestions\t<\/div><br>I would like to suggest something I personally would think would improve the game.<br><br>- quick selection of units<br>- an random map generator where you can just fight<br>- expansion and mention in-game on the RPG and DNA systems<br>- ability to change the color of your hive and units once you complete story mode <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Final Thoughts\t<\/div><br>The Hive is an amazing game and I cannot wait to see it finished. I hope the developer takes their time and polishes it. Currently, as you would expect from an early access title (V 0.071) there are going to be difficulties and problems, but this game shows potential and I believe it can be reached. I will be happy to redo my review once the game is done or a major update arrives. The game is currently unrefined and I hope to see it progress into a great refined game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> TL;DR\t<\/div><br>The Hive is a fun strategy game with a good story. The scenery is nice along with the music, however two of the game mechanics are not mentioned (RPG and DNA). There is currently a huge difficulty curve existing within the game but the developer is planning to add more content which should help even that curve out. The developer is in the discussions and will be happy to reply to you. I suggest getting this game if you like the trailers, but I suggest doing your research to see what has been added\/ going to be added. Currently the game is unrefined but its future seems bright.<br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16925814', 'summary' );

option doesn\u00b4t work so far (can\u00b4t click it). Besides that you have options for &quot;continue&quot;, &quot;new game&quot;, &quot;load game&quot; (you can\u00b4t save games atm, so nothing to load), &quot;credits&quot; and &quot;exit&quot;. Continuing a game, you can choose the first and second map (a third to be expected soon), it also says &quot;Page 1 of 5&quot;.<br><br>There is a countdown timer until the next big release is scheduled.<br><br>Starting a new game, the intro sets you in Earth\u00b4s +100ish years future. One day meteors literally start falling out of the sky. This comes as a total suprise to its inhabitants. (If you plan on becoming an astronomist, don\u00b4t, there obviously is no market for it in the future.)<br>Humanity then goes on to build one (1) spaceship.<br>After three years of meteor rain, the ship is launched just as earth is destroyed, and mankind boldly goes where no one has gone before.<br>After some time of travel a planet is discovered. The planet seems to be inhabited by monsters, living in a harsh environment. Oh, and there are underground ruins.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Despite being a nice intro, it has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. Like, at all.<br>After an intro showing earth\u00b4s destruction and humanity escaping into space, you would think that you actually play a human civilisation, right?<br>WRONG!<br><u>Obviously<\/u> you will play bug-like aliens, who have to kill lizard-like aliens to satisfy fire demons.<br>True, the title says &quot;Hive&quot;, but still. Well, maybe it\u00b4s just me.<br><br>You start your civilisation with one worker, being able to build 3 buildings: Hive, Barracks, and Worker Den (storage building).<br>You can build Workers (building and ressource gathering), Legionnaires (light melee), Hunters (light range), Hive Queen (heavy melee).<br>On the first mission, you have to build up your base, an army, an then venture out to kill some mobs and some more mobs. You\u00b4re finished after killing the boss, which a fire demon tells you to do.<br>On the second mission (which I\u00b4m currently playing), you have additionally a puzzle to solve.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pro\u00b4s and Con\u00b4s<\/div>This is an early access review, so I will not bother to list any con\u00b4s or complain about missing content until the game is actually released. From the actual content it seems to be more like a pre-alpha, but still, by far not the worst early access I\u00b4ve seen.<br><br>On the positive side, the game sets the ground for a lot of nice things and has lots of potential. Despite being labeled as adventure\/indie\/strategy it is more a strategy\/scifi\/rpg.<br><br><u>Strategy<\/u><br>Could be compared with Age of Empires. You can collect ressources, at the moment food and ressource, and have a population cap. You can build different units in different buildings. I\u00b4d like more buildings, units, hopefully research.<br><br><u>RPG<\/u><br>The fact that your units have the slots for items (Weapon, Shield, Helmet, Armor, 2 Rings), even though you can\u00b4t build items yet, gives me great hope for the final release. Units have attack and defense values, and the ability to level, even though you don\u00b4t see any xp values so far. Looking forward to this.<br><br><u>Scifi<\/u><br>The fact that you\u00b4re playing alien bugs on a different planet is just awesome, right?<br>I\u00b4d like to see more races, maybe some humans mentioned in the intro could venture out into the game.<br><br><u>Features<\/u><br>Besides your UI on the bottom you also have a minimap. The view can be rotated 360\u00b0 horizontally and about 30\u00b0 vertically (meaning almost birds-view to almost overseeing the entire map). The game has decent graphic and atmospheric voice acting.<br>I personally am really hoping for a crossover between Age of Empires and Heroes of Might and Magic.

Players take control of the Insectoid Hive mind.<br><br>After a very solid presentation that details the background to the game you begin with a single worker and an objective. The first objective is to build a hive. The objective system is the primary game mechanic that leverages the storyline and the gameplay. Each time you complete an objective you are presented with a new challenge. Rinse and repeat.<br><br>In order to complete a number of these objectives resource management comes into play. You must hunt or dig for resources \u2013 food and minerals. It is these that enable you to develop your armies and your villages.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Outstanding Presentation<\/div><br>Without a shadow of a doubt the highlight of the game is in its presentation. This includes the graphical and audible presentation as well as the narration.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed the opening cutscene to the game. I thought it served extremely well as an introduction to the game and it inspired me to want to play through the game. This led in well to an overall graphics and audio display that is of an exceptionally high quality for an indie studio. It is one of the best presented indie games that I have had the pleasure of playing.<br><br>The screenshots and gameplay footage featured within the trailers serve as an accurate reflection of the artistic approach to the game. They have not been doctored to make them look better than the actual quality you will see within the game.<br><br>The narration and the overall storyline are top notch. This kept my motivation levels high to grind through the game even as the actual gameplay itself was disappointing. It invested me into the game to the degree that I was certain that I wanted to continue playing the game when any drop in quality may have seen me quit entirely. Therefore, I absolutely give kudos to the writers as well as the artist and sound engineers.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Falls short as an RTS<\/div><br>The game falls short of the mark when it comes to being a deep RTS. Although the game has all of the mechanics and tools that an RTS has it generally lacks depth and polish. This, in my opinion, is because the game attempts to be everything and when that encompasses a number of genres that\u2019s almost impossible to achieve. Had the developers spent a little more time attempting to specialize the game in a strategic direction it would have resulted in a vastly improved title.<br><br>Another criticism that I have of the game is that there always appears to be one best way to accomplishing a certain task. There is a distinct lack of variability and this reduces the replayability of the game. Therefore, I find this to be more than a little disappointing considering the game bills itself as a game having \u2018many different endings and possibilities\u2019 with players being able to \u2018create their own unique route, strategy, and story.\u2019<br><br>A final criticism is that the AI of the computer is poorly designed. Whenever the computer is successful it feels as though it is a result of the player\u2019s own stupidity and sheer dumb luck rather than being a hard fought contest. Once you do figure out that one best way to any given solution players will utilize the same strategies again and again throughout the course of the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Is it Steamified?<\/div><br>The Hive has 40 Steam achievements as well as a set of trading cards. Given the nature of the game this is about as Steamified as what we could possibly ask for.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div><br>If the developers were able to produce the same quality in the gameplay as they did in the presentation, we would be looking at an indie game of the year contender. The Hive is not a poor game but it\u2019s just not a great game. It lacks the overall polish and depth in the gameplay department to be a truly special game. However, we must bear in mind that this is the first game developed and published by Skydome Entertainment. I genuinely believe that they would have learned so many lessons through the creation and development process of this game that it should hold them in good stead in the future. Consequently, they are a game studio to keep a close eye on. The potential is there if they are able to put those lessons into action in their next game. The Hive is a good beginning.<br><br>I recommend The Hive for the high quality of work in the presentation of the game.<br><br>For similar reviews and for your chance to win great giveaways visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Steamified<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25259105', 'summary' );

Which is awesome.<br><br>Negatives:<br>-No options! What's up with that? I get that it's early access, but I'm disspointed I could not adjust the graphic quality or volume settings as well as the other options<br>-The difficulty ramps up increadibly quickly, too quickly. The first 3 stages were a peice of cake, but in stage 4 enemies literally swarm you before you have a chance to build up your defenses. I assume with the inclusion of the DNA resource, and the upgrade that come with it, stage 4 would be a lot more reasonable, but as of right now its too hectic and almost unplayable. <br>-No naming system. I want to name all my insectoid minions and build a connection with them as they level up.<br><br>With all that being said I would highly recommend The Hive and I look forward to updates that will make this game better.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18359852', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18359852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18359852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18359852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18359852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18359852', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18359852_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18359852_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14085082\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shintaja\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"31519136\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d8cf2f4c37f9cfcd85e41fba77707d6326406dfe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d8cf2f4c37f9cfcd85e41fba77707d6326406dfe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d8cf2f4c37f9cfcd85e41fba77707d6326406dfe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shintaja\/\" data-miniprofile=\"31519136\">Haulikkogun<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shintaja\/games\/?tab=all\">146 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shintaja\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shintaja\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">46.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Hive was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've been following The Hive for awhile now and decided that it was time to try the game.<br><br>While the game has it ups and downs mostly missing features at the moment but overall experience is quite good.<br><br>The story of The Hive begins with the humans leaving their home planet to escape the imminent destruction of the human race.

The graphics are similar to Starcraft 2 but more detailed.<br><br>The music and sound effects in The Hive are really good and fits the whole atmosphere of the game.<br><br>While The Hive is in Early Access it has provided a good strategic game and I expect great things from it!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14085082', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14085082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14085082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14085082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14085082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14085082', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14085082_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14085082_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12600332\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"116730008\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fe1e20b5066ec8f4ece8fcaa42941f8a2f2a7557.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fe1e20b5066ec8f4ece8fcaa42941f8a2f2a7557.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fe1e20b5066ec8f4ece8fcaa42941f8a2f2a7557_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/\" data-miniprofile=\"116730008\">SerJonSnow<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/games\/?tab=all\">2,221 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/serjonsnow\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Hive was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 21, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've only played about 20 minutes of The Hive (you can see those 20 minutes <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tmohPvzDoFk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > in my video here. <\/a><br><br>However, the game already shows potential.

As far as game mechanics go, there is nothing groundbreaking but it holds with the tried and true mechanics in most RTS games. <br><br>If you don't want to read a (somewhat) detailed review, here's a first impression video of the first ~15 minutes of the game: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/i8V94XbAthg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/i8V94XbAthg<\/a><br><br>The controls are extremely intuitive especially if you've ever played an RTS before. 9\/10<br><br>The artwork is amazing. It's all relatively low poly with surprisingly detailed textures. At one point I spent a full minute just staring at a leaf because I was so impressed with it. While the lifeforms in the water are very good, there aren't many  bugs or animals roaming other than the turtles you kill for food. 8\/10<br><br>As for mechanics it's like any other RTS game. It functions almost the same as Age of Mythology which came out 10+ years ago. 8\/10<br><br>The story has some cool and interesting possibilities to it but I still don't know how the opening trailer relates in any way to the game so far. It's just too early to tell. ?\/10<br><br>Overall this is a fun game, with good artwork and an intriguing story but it is too soon to give a real rating for it. If I were basing a rating on potential and vision I'd say 9\/10. But it's just too soon to say much other than it's ?\/10.<br><br>If you're undecided here's a first impressions video of the first ~15 minutes of the game - <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/i8V94XbAthg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/i8V94XbAthg<\/a><br>At this stage in the build I'd say buy it if it's on sale or just give it a little more time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15931550', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15931550' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15931550\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15931550' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15931550\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15931550', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15931550_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15931550_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15525024\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198001653289\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"41387561\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f9\/f91787b7fb6d4a2cb8dee079ab457839b33a8845.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f9\/f91787b7fb6d4a2cb8dee079ab457839b33a8845.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f9\/f91787b7fb6d4a2cb8dee079ab457839b33a8845_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198001653289\/\" data-miniprofile=\"41387561\">Rusty One Two<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198001653289\/games\/?tab=all\">420 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198001653289\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198001653289\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Hive was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis review is current as of Alpha 0.5 &quot;The Wasteland,&quot; and contains potential spoilers.<br><br>This is a fairly standard RTS with a unique story that will be interesting to see unfold as the Early Access alpha progresses. I have posted some screenshots of curiosities in play that may represent known or unknown bugs.<br><br>For the prospective player, I would suggest considering this game if you if you like your RTS with lots of story. If you're looking for constant explosions and AAA graphics interlaced with hyper-masculine robo-marines, I think you know where to go. This is an indie title in development, not a finished game, and not THAT sort of game to begin with.<br><br>For the player\/developer, like me, this is a great game for several reasons, not the least of which actually is the state that it's currently in. We can see that the game engine works fine, it may be Unity based on a number of observable factors but there are other things it *could* be, and as each act is released we see the gameplay mature. <br><br>For the developer of this game, I do have some notes. <br><br>Story - The introductory movie actually strongly implies that we are playing the humans, which was confusing, and then we are not playing the humans, and then three levels into the game there are human-like things but they don't seem to be the humans. The levels we move through appear to be sunlit but there is reference to &quot;the surface,&quot; and there are trees and such, which again imply that we are not in catacombs or underground, but are on a surface of some kind. This is confusing. While story in RTS is usually very linear, it would be nice to see player agency used to some degree. We appear to be playing the villains of the story, and the Insectoid Advisor character, having voice acting that comes out similar to a cartoon villain, frequently commands you to kill things that could have been talked to. Also, from the science fiction beginnings of the 'ark in space' we are immediately then fighting undead and summoning golems and performing rituals to contact the underworld. Some preparation for that would have been nice. It makes this a Fantasy game, or a Science Fantasy game, rather than a Science Fiction game. <br><br>Art Assets and Theme - The Hive we are controlling is frequently referred to as 'insectoid' but it appears to be more like crustaceans and snails. Particularly the Hive Queen who has a beautiful shell. These features are not typical of insects or hive creatures, but of animals we are familiar with for being individual, though small and often found repellant. Obviously it's far too late in development to change the art assets themselves, but some explanation and description of the animals hierarchy, their anatomy, how they work as a hive, these things would be interesting and would add a lot to the game. The strength of this game is all in the name, people come here for the bugs, it's good that they're beautiful, I think they should be diverse as they have been made so far, and I think they should probably be linked at a psychic or magical level (whatever fits your mythology better) and differ from what we have previously understood as insects or hive creatures. This should probably get some discussion in game, but perhaps not directly as instruction. The hive might absorb a new creature type (consider the highly successful mechanic from Endless Legend in having secondary kingdoms provide new units) and get a chance to have the advisor discuss how &quot;These two species are both compatible with our hive psyche, but we lack the strength to absorb both of them! Choose one, and destroy the other!&quot; And then you pick, say, whether you take over the lizard people from the first couple levels as scouts or the mega-turtles as heavies. The assets change to match your color scheme and after a couple levels have tentacles or bug armor and their name has changed. They've gone from &quot;lizard thrall&quot; to &quot;Lizardoid Scout&quot; without any ceremony. <br><br>Terrain - I like the terrain for the most part, but it could really benefit from normal maps and shadows. If the game is in Unity, consider the Relief Terrain Pack and Advanced Foliage Shader assets. It might be a bit of a job integrating them into your project, but I think you would find at least some use of the shaders beneficial. The terrain stands out as less animated and lower quality than your other art assets. I'd recommend introducing wind and weather. If the game is intended to be underground, that needs to come across in the terrain. You've clearly got a good grasp of particles and smoke, use those skills to do shafts of light reaching down, dust sifting through huge caverns, that kind of thing. It shouldn't be so sunny if it's underground. <br><br>RTS Mechanics - The Hive has a squad cap apparently equal to 1 + (11x(The Number of Hives you build), but each unit type has a hidden cap as well. I discovered this by accident when I built a second hive in the second mission in order put a healing station next to the ritual so my army would not face any attrition during the time attack sequence. After building the second main base building, I had a squad cap of 23, but I could really only build to about 15 units including 5 or 6 workers. This number of workers made resource gathering easy, and they are combat capable. In the third act adding the Medic brought the total squad cap to 16, even though building a second main base building brought it to 23 again. I have some screen shots on my profile documenting this. Also, perhaps before the enemies get any smarter or numerous, we need an &quot;attack move&quot; command, really a staple of the modern RTS, in which units are commanded to move and attack anything in their pathway. <br><br>Gameplay - The biggest area for improvement for this game is the way it feels. The Hive really feels very much unlike a hive. The units build and fight pretty much like any other army in any other basic RTS I've played. The game is in the early stages of development, and the story is really what shines here, but I think there is huge potential here that is being overlooked. <br><br>Make the Hive into a hive. <br><br>It may sound impossible to go back and change these fundamentals. If it is, sorry for saying negative things and providing solutions you can't use. However, I'm going to suggest these things because, as a developer myself, I can see a way that these solutions could be made a reality and how they could really make this title pop.<br><br>A unit should be a swarm of units, rather than a group of 3 to 5. The Queen should be the first unit out, and should be able to start producing drones. Rather than specific commands and individual orders, worker drones should be given targets, and since they should be particles under Boid logic rather than individual units, they should be commanded from the Queen unit or a fundamental menu. So, you can still have the workers build buildings and fish fish pools and kill turtles, but there should be a whole lot more of them doing it at once. Then the Queen builds the hive and moves into it, gaining an upgrade to Squad cap and uses it as a protective measure. The same really goes for the other unit types, though honestly, they should be promoted up from worker drones. The drones should always be doing something, and they should be crawling around all over everything. There needs to be tons of them. <br><br>The reason I think this is doable is that, for example if the game is in Unity which I develop in, it's a change in game mechanics which is mostly a secondary scripting issue, and it's a change from using prefabs of individual assets to using prefabs of particle emitters which emit particles that are prefabs of those assets. The particle density would actually be controlled by the capacity of the machine the game was running on. So your squad cap is 12 *swarms* each of which is automatically created as blank drones that just run around, and those swarms might be dozens of bugs. <br><br>I think it would be fantastic.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15525024', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15525024' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15525024\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15525024' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15525024\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15525024', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15525024_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15525024_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21489249\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JimmyDali\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105024479\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/609bb41d982dc3335bdd0f48b105cce37c8145e5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/609bb41d982dc3335bdd0f48b105cce37c8145e5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/609bb41d982dc3335bdd0f48b105cce37c8145e5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JimmyDali\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105024479\">Jimmy Dali<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JimmyDali\/games\/?tab=all\">370 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JimmyDali\/recommended\/\">41 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JimmyDali\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Hive was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGood RTS game.

This game is real good. While lacking the polish of a finished title (still early access and all that) there is no doubt in my mind that The Hive is a game I'm glad I've had the opportunity to try out. The Hive is a RTS that is very heavy on the story elements. Basically, you'll be exploring this world as much as you will be smashing your foes and managing resources.  <br><br>The story is your usual, &quot;we had to escape Earth because it got screwed&quot; storyline except instead of taking on the predictable role of the Human Race, you actually play as a mysterious Insectoid race known as The Hive. You'll solve puzzles while also killing animals for food and amassing hordes of insects to kill Lizardmen, skeletons and all manner of bad guys. You'll meet old gods, titan-like creatures and you'll have to bring down some seriously over powered enemies. <br><br>In terms of sound, artwork, and level design, this game exceeds on levels that very much remind me of Warcraft 3. Truly, the game actually feels very similar to WC3, except if you had a whole race devoted to large number horde tactics and passive buffs that make the horde even more powerful (Sort of like the beetle guys the undead had in FT). I love all the little details in this game as well. Like when your workers are harvesting resources, they create a little pile that actually gets bigger the more they gather and a tiny beetle creature comes and transports the resources back to the base. It's so insignificant but it's just an extra piece of world building that helps immerse one in the game. Mechanically, the game is just as sound, there are a few tactics that seem more effective than others and I'll refrain from spoiling anything for now but I'm sure as time goes on, it will be ironed out.<br><br>In summation, this game is pretty solid and I can't help but look optimistically towards it's final release. <br><br>Gameplay Footage:<br> <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DO4qhEw0Sy4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_3\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DO4qhEw0Sy4<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21680913', 'summary' );

There is no in game save. Fine, at least theres a feature that saves progress when finished an Act.<\/b><\/div><br>&quot;<i>Operation cwal, black sheep wall and power overwhelming 'do not work.'<\/i>&quot;<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">First off lets talk about the bad since its apparent right off the bat.<\/div><br>For all of us <b>Starcraft<\/b> vets know we rip offs when we see it. But its not bad here, just sounds and Zergling-ish skins.<br><br>When you start the game you meet you advisor whose voice is rather questioning, is it a bug or a slow talker with a weird voice. I listened to it the first time through the game, but skipped after that because it wasn't so great. <br><br>Now the slow march to finish and repetitive nature of missions is problem. In a RTS game there is always some incentive to try and rush through a mission with some measure of strategy. In my case all I needed to do was turtle up and max out my army to be able to handle everything. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>You could even wait till you have your Avatar, Rhino's and Medics all fully equipped with defensive items and you'll likely be able to kill the Drowned God with that set up<\/span><\/span>. So strategy is out the window. <br><br>Inventory sorting needs work. A quick fix to this would have been adding an auto-sort. Also, the fact you can't place items from one bag into another isn't great.<br><br>Hotkeys for building should have been implemented before the game was released. RTS games do require this.<br><br>Camera controls are undefensibly terrible. For me I just rotated my camera to face north and left it there, <u>forever<\/u>.<br><br>Puzzles are not puzzles, its basically like using the Claws in Skyrim, then rotating the dials to complete a picture. Not puzzly in my opinion.<br><br>There are too few different types of enemies with all the same weaknesses. If you have a high attack power you win since almost every enemy has about the same attack power and defense power. <b>Even bosses or elite enemies are like this<\/b>. Stat differences would be welcome.<br><br><b>Unit response time is a big thumbs down<\/b>. In most cases right-clicking on the map makes the units move immediately but there are times when the units just sit there (idle)  for a second or two (sometimes even while in battle) then decide to run. Bad because theres a chance you could lost your squad or important units.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Now that the bad is out of the way lets look at some good things.<\/div><br>DNA is kind of unique, there are systems like this in other games but none (in my experience) that continues between missions. Basically its research points acquired through disassembly of your unwanted items. Its awesome, but you'll have so much more than you need by Act 7. Not a deal breaker though and still a positive.<br><br>The story is what can make a game great, this is getting there. While the story can be slow and the ending leaves you wondering why there wasn't more Acts introduced, its decent and can definitely be expanded in future updates.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Overall, it may seem like the Cons outweigh the Pros but all in all its still a good game. The Cons will most likely be things that can be fixed later on and their small things, except for the slow march and extreme repetition of missions.<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29357989', 'recent_short' );

Great graphics and visuals of the game. Gameplay is interesting as well as the unique story of the Insectizoid empire you are currently trying to build as the sotry progresses. To the creators, i suggest adding hero units that are similar to the hive queen, but have different roles in their unit type. I also like the concept that, throughout the story\/gameplay, the player is constantly looking for parts, equipment, and especially DNA that would help evolve currently owned and unlock more units to help you through the game. I would like to have more buildings that the workers can build like a blacksmith building or a market building where the player can collect pieces of raw material and uing those materials, create weapons and armor that units can equip. Overall, it is an amazing new game. There are still a lot of things missing that the would make this game very addictive to players, but it shows potential to become one.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25308681', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25308681' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25308681\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25308681' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25308681\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25308681', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25308681_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25308681_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25290500\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Furea\/recommended\/325730\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"81800163\">Sebastian<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is pretty well done.

It doesn't make the game more challenging but just more tedious. Even on normal, though, the gameplay isn't great. The movement is clunky and for only one small reason, when you rightclick on a place you cannot reach your characters will just stop. I wish it just moved you to the closest spot on the map to that unreachable area. The combat is functional but would be a whole lot better if using special unit abilities was easier (instead of having to click or tab through each unit).<br><br>The levels need to have some checkpoints so you can actually quit the game.
