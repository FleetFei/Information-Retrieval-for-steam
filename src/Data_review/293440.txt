You play as Elliot, a young man with a troubled past, afflicted by a powerful curse. The story here is secondary and is conveyed through short, vague cutscenes and occassional flashes of internal dialogue. It has yet to draw me in and is so far nothing more than a simple backdrop for the game itself.<br><br>Mechanically the game is very impressive and satisfying. You start with the simple ability to shoot and jump. Jumping is floaty and allows for change in trajectory mid jump which enables tricky platforming sections and the ability to fight in mid air. The arrows Elliot fires travel along a set arc rather than directly ahead allowing you to kill grounded enemies from above and calculate your aim. Killing enemies in succession fills a 'chain' meter in the bottom left of the screen which seems to increase your overall damage, of course it could be doing anything which leads me neatly to my next point.<br><br>Elliot Quest in true old-school style presents incredibly little in the way of tutorial, granted there's not a lot you can do at the start, but simple keybinding would have been sufficient.  This becomes a greater problem later down the line however as new items and upgrades  don't even come with a line of text explaining what they do or to what extent. Additionally, the game contains no options whatsoever beyond adjusting audio levels. No remappable keys, no screen-size options, nothing. The game opens in a window by default which can be maximized but cannot enter fullscreen and while controller support exists it does not seem to allow control with the analogue sticks, these are, however, only minor criticisms.<br><br>The game employs an overworld map with sidescrolling levels and enemy encounters (think Gargoyle's Quest on the gameboy).The metroidvanian influence becomes clear during the first level as I was soon presented with inaccessible secrets and shortcuts I would have to come back to later with enhanced abilities. Those who care to explore will be rewarded with many 'secret walls' and rooms containing treasure, all optional and all hidden. There are a number of collectibles to find including rare treasures which are housed in Elliot's trophy room and  11 crystals - I have no idea what either might do, but I want them all.<br><br>The first dungeon boss bestowed upon me the power of the wind which can be used not only as a means of traversing new areas, but for combat aswell, allowing me to travel through enemies and stun them while still being able to fire arrows from within my mighty typhoon. Pretty much all spells and items thus far have had different uses in and out of combat making the upgrades you receive feel more meaningful as opposed to simply being a tool to beat the dungeon it was found in. The inspiration from the Zelda series is undeniable here from the dungeons, to the items ,even the aesthetic. And as expected, before long, I found ERROR sitting happily in one of the village houses.<br><br>Graphically, the game creates a pleasing, simplistic pixel world with vibrant colours and a charming style. Nothing fancy here, and I wouldn't ask for any more. The soundtrack  by Michael Chait is well constructed with suitably archetypal tracks that scream 'dungeon, or 'town' or 'forest' (which if I didn't know any better was a straight rip from A Link to the Past's lost woods theme). Some of the compositions are very enjoyable to listen to and knowingly harken back to the 8-bit classics the game so heavily resembles.<br><br>Mild rpg features such as exp and skill trees grant a sense of purpose to the never ending slaughter in which you will partake. Enemies respawn every time you exit and re-enter an area and many cannot be comfortaby avoided. The fact that even when revisiting an area for the umpteenth time and having to kill the same enemioes over and over, im still benefitting myself reduces much of the drudgery of backtracking. Additionally the passive abilities granted by the multiple skill trees can assist somewhat in combat and help to vary gameplay styles a little potentially aiding replayability. By the time the second town is reached the gold gained from backtracking and grinding can be put to good use for more meaningful equipment upgrades, Elliot keeps getting stronger and the pace never slows.<br><br>Overall Elliot Quest is a fun, suitably challenging (the difficulty seemed to leap up after the first dungeon, compounded by the fact that health is scarce) adventure-platformer that should appeal greatly to sidescroller, Zelda and metroidvania fans. It's a little rough around the edges but the gameplay shines through. There's a meaty amount of content on offer here, rife with secrets, shortcuts and easter eggs. There are a few frustrations such as sometimes cheap insta-deaths (which can be a real pain late on in the game as dying results in loss of XP), and I got painfully lost on more than one occasion, but those looking for a challenge should feel right at home with Elliot Quest's old-school style of action platforming.<br><br>=EDIT=<br>Developer Ansimuz has continued to patch and update the game.

There's a good blend of action, puzzle solving, exploring and traversal. A lot of what the game does, others have done before it with a few exceptions such as a whirlwind attack that pulls in enemies and items that also lets you cross large gaps or cut through green vines.<br><br>You play as a boy named Elliot on his way to rescue Cara. Its a typical plot for a typical game. Every so often text will appear telling you about Cara or what she means to Elliot, but beyond that the story and plot are an afterthought.<br><br>The time was spent in making little traversal puzzles that feel engaging. Defeating a snail and using its shell to get to a higher place. Throwing the body of a stone spitting octopus into purple goo to travel across. Rolling a giant bomb off a cliff are just a few ways the game turns the typical into engaging.<br><br>Your primary weapon is a bow with short range arrows. Gravity affects your arrows and it turns the game into one of skill and finesse. There's a nuance to timing, gravity and enemy location that more games should have. Shooting off a cliff to have gravity take your arrow down onto an enemy is satisfying. At some point you can unlock a charge shot that launches the arrow straight forward with no drop off. This charge shot results in a critical hit every time rather than a small fraction of the time.<br><br>Along the way you get a number of different items, skills and abilities. You gain a shield that you can use to block projectiles if you are standing still, a double jump feather, a shovel for digging, a lantern so you can see in caves and light other lanterns, a limited supply of bombs and much more. The only catch to the bombs is that they have to be purchased or found in a specific spot. So if you run out, you'll be headed back into a dungeon to replenish your supply. Defeated enemies will drop hearts or magic pellets to restore health and mana.<br><br>While the game is a 2D side scroller for the most part, there is an overworld map with several locations some are hidden and you need to touch them before a bubble comes up indicating you can enter. There are a few towns, labyrinths and out of the way places to explore. In the labyrinths these are so big that you'll get a map indicating which room you're in. Its nice to have, because there's a lot you can miss and a lot that you'll need to come back for once you've got specific abilities. You'll have to scour a lot of places several times over.<br><br>There are a couple of enemies on the overworld that you can run into. These enemies send you to one of a few random side scrolling battle zones. These zones are well thought out and can be little mazes by themselves. One has an old key for a house door, another has a bag. It adds exploration and intrigue to what could have been mundane.<br><br>There are often labyrinths on your way to labyrinths; the second of which is the one with the boss fight. The boss labyrinths have keys and giant keys needed to unlock boss doors. Guardians can be found in select locations across both types of labyrinths.<br><br>While you're scouring dungeons, you can come across heart containers that increase the maximum amount of your health and green elixirs to increase your maximum mana. Its a mechanic used it plenty of other adventure games, even action games and it helps give a sense that you're getting better. There are plenty of other things taken from its inspiration, but there's always a twist to them in order to make them feel fresh. Stone shooting octopi are only vulnerable when they're shooting at you. Slime will split into other slime.<br><br>Make sure to push up against every wall, because there are frequent hidden areas that become visible only when you've found them. These are nothing mandatory, but they do contain plenty of chests with gold inside and collectible crystals. The gold itself feels near useless. There are only a couple of things worth purchasing in the entire game. Other than necessities, there are a few consumable items like red potions for health, green potions for mana and a feather to return you to the last save point. You can only carry two consumables at a time and often, I'd just forget that I have them.<br><br>As you defeat enemies, you'll earn experience and once you get enough of it, you will level up and earn a skill point. With these points you can assign them to one of five stats: strength, wisdom, agility, vitality and accuracy for an improved chance of critical hits. Each stat can have a level of five with each level unlocking new or improved abilities. Strength is to shoot arrows farther, but at the third level, you can unlock a charge shot. Wisdom says magic orbs might give double the mana, and at the second level, your mana regenerates, level four spells do more damage and at five spells cost half. Agility improves your shooting rate, level four lets you run faster and level five lets you evade projectiles. Vitality says hearts may give double health, the second level takes half damage 15% of the time, at the fourth health regenerates and the fifth lets you take half damage 30% of the time.<br><br>With all the great stuff that's here, the only real issue I have with the game is that it can be cryptic. The townsfolk are no help. Some things are self explanatory, but others such as catching a draft as a whirlwind to launch yourself up took me a few hours to understand that's what I needed to do. I was stuck looking and searching through every secret room looking for a double jump.<br><br>There's often too much locked away from you at once. Since the game is open world, you can enter fifteen different areas, but only get so far in them before you need to head back. If you're stumped, taking a look back through each labyrinth for something you've missed just takes too long. Is that a bad problem to have though? At least the leveling up and experience mechanic meant that every time I explored the same area, I was still being rewarded.<br><br>The only other downside that I can think of is there are no achievements or Steam overlay. Instead there's great music and a charming art style. I'll take the latter over the former.<br><br>Elliot Quest is a wonderful game that scratches every itch for intelligent gameplay. Its well worth the price of admission, even if its been done in other games, Elliot Quest does it on par with its forefathers and surpasses them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20605636', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20605636' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20605636\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20605636' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20605636\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20605636', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20605636_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20605636_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14011874\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paragus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"66019290\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/00\/00cc68e1347de2a41bba270a8fca552a2ade6f52.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/00\/00cc68e1347de2a41bba270a8fca552a2ade6f52.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/00\/00cc68e1347de2a41bba270a8fca552a2ade6f52_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paragus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"66019290\">Paragus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paragus\/games\/?tab=all\">210 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paragus\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paragus\/recommended\/293440\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImagine playing Zelda 2, but instead of Link you play as Kid Icarus, and collect Metroid style power-ups.   Thats is Elliot Quest in a nut shell.   This game far surpassed my expectations in terms of how big it is, and how well designed it was as a Metroidvania.   Tons of secrets, optional bosses, and upgrades to find.   The game also has a leveling system that allows you to allocate points into various stats that yield various passive bonuses, although the max level isn't high enough to let you get everything, so decisions need to be made carefully.  Clearing the game and all of its final bosses took me about 20 hours, which is really good for a metroidvania, so good value for your money here.<br><br>As far as negatives go, the in-game options are pretty weak.   There is no way to remap your controls, and the default ones are a little weird using SPACE to jump and D to shoot.   It's not enough to ruin the game or anything, but why wouldn't pick 2 buttons next to each other.   Also there is no explanation for many of the items you find telling you what they are and what they do.  Not a super big deal as many of them are obvious, but some of them have pretty obscure uses that may not be obvious at first,  like using ice to freeze wooden boxes?  Would have liked to see steam achievements as well.<br><br>All of the positives far outweigh the negatives though.   The game is everything you could want in a metroidvania, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these types of game or any Zelda 2 fan.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14011874', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14011874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14011874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14011874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14011874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14011874', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14011874_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14011874_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21349142\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Maxmetpt\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"71459466\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b6ce34650b037a7ee9106d7d7d2e0bb3467f946.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b6ce34650b037a7ee9106d7d7d2e0bb3467f946.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b6ce34650b037a7ee9106d7d7d2e0bb3467f946_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Maxmetpt\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71459466\">Maxmetpt<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Maxmetpt\/games\/?tab=all\">780 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Maxmetpt\/recommended\/\">187 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Maxmetpt\/recommended\/293440\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tElliot Quest is essentially the second Zelda game, on the NES.<br>It feels old, and it's intended. While it does have some more modern features (the checkpoints, for instance), it doesn't really try to do much beyond being a Zelda tribute, and a really hard one at that!<br><br>I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, entirely. I beat the main story, but I gave up on the last &quot;end-game&quot; Boss, out of frustration. The pay-off wasn't very alluring either.<br>The problem isn't the Boss itself, but all of the little problems around the game that make big fights a problem.<br><br>I won't go into details about most of it, so don't consider a review. These are just some of my thoughts about the game, and one aspect that might make the game worth it, for you.<br><br>If you're looking for that old-school, very hard experience, go for it! Including some of the very cryptic puzzles, and being lost and disorientated for hours.<br><br>The game is somewhat like a metroidvania. You have an overworld separated into areas. Each area, then, is separated into other areas, these being gated by several of the items you will acquire on the adventure. It gets very confusing, because you'll see many &quot;gates&quot; throughout the areas, and when you get the item, you have no idea where the gate was. There are also many gates for little upgrades, to make matters even more confusing.<br>Nothing too unusual for NES-like games.<br><br>Anyway, my problem was mostly the checkpoint system: it doesn't restore your HP fully. Nor your mana. Only half of it. So, if you die in a boss, you'll be handicapped. The only way of getting HP\/Mana then is either to kill enemies, or go into a town to buy potions\/rest. You can imagine how incredibly frustrating this is. It's a waste of several minutes each time you die, if you want a decent shot at the later bosses!<br><br>Not to mention you can only carry 2 potions at any time, and these are not replenishable at checkpoints. So yes, it's a far too punishing checkpoint system for me to bother with that one Boss fight. I endured through all the others, but after 5 bosses, the 6th one was too much. Death from a thousand cuts, I guess.<br><br>So, rant is over. So far, you have my reasons for not enjoying it (well, the ultimate reasons, although there were several little reasons throughout -- old design. I don't like it, but I expected it from this game, so no hard feelings!)<br>The thing that surprised me -- and the reason for me being writting about the game, right now -- was the end-game. Things you can do <i>after<\/i> you beat the story. Technically, you should do it before, but it's much harder than the final boss, so you might as well...<br><br>Anyway, you can collect these little crystals that are very well hidden. Either hidden, or behind a very cryptic puzzle, and mostly isolated (as in, the game doesn't prepare you for those types of puzzles). It's cool. It's supposed to be hard, and the ultimate challenge.<br><br>What I loved about it, was how &quot;grand&quot; it felt, in a way. I was simply exploring, after collecting some crystals, and saw a door that required crystals to enter (there are many). I entered a completely different area, and discovered even higher upgrades than the ones you encounter through the normal story. Then Bosses! I was pumped. <br><br>It reminds me of the Legendary aspect of Pokemon, where you go into these secluded areas and find ancient monsters to either capture or simply beat.<br>Plus hidden stores, etc.<br>I wasn't expecting that at all and it seems like something games don't really do much, anymore. PC games, anyway. The whole end-game seems rather lost. The story guides you through all of the upgrades, and after you beat a game, there's isn't anything &quot;bigger&quot; beyond it.<br><br>So yeah, sorry for ruining the surprise! Regardless, if this seems something you enjoy, get the game -- but know what you're getting into.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21349142', 'summary' );

The &quot;Good&quot; ending has satisfactory, even if it isn't the happy ending some might want.<br><br>The &quot;Karma&quot; system is very basic and has no nuance, so expect to end up with the neutral ending if you don't act 100% one way from the start.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Quality and Replayability<\/div>The game is missing a some polish in multiple areas and the developers have evidently no interest in fixing those things. <br>Some examples:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li> There are many spots of incomplete content, for example collectibles hidden behind doors that can't be opened or keys with no purpose.<br>    <\/li><li> Bomb drops from crates which explode on discovery rather than allowing the player to pick them up.<br>    <\/li><li> Cutscenes which can't be skipped (reduce the enjoyment when re-trying boss fights)<br>    <\/li><li> Bugs leading to Elliot getting stuck in walls<br>    <\/li><li> Errors in physics*<\/li><\/ul><br>*You can you can move objects using your arrows and pushing them against some &quot;inmovable&quot; objects makes them slide on the ground.<br><br>There is no real reason to play through it twice as New Game+ is basically just hard mode, you could look at the other of the 3 endings, but there is not much difference to it. And there's an arena you can unlock, though there are no rewards tied to it.<br><br>The addition of Achievements would help guide the player and give purpose to some of the unused systems.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion\/TL:DR<\/div>The game should be fun enough for fans of the genre, and I expect there's enough game to justify the money, especially if it is purchased during a sale.<br>Just be warned that the game shows cut corners and lack of polish in some areas, as would be expected from its source.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25962850', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25962850' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25962850\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25962850' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25962850\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25962850', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25962850_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25962850_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13981390\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072182182\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"111916454\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d49a95fc99946a31ed4bcfc11b92a3801bf9f4f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d49a95fc99946a31ed4bcfc11b92a3801bf9f4f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d49a95fc99946a31ed4bcfc11b92a3801bf9f4f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072182182\/\" data-miniprofile=\"111916454\">Zeebrax the Astral Lifejacket<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072182182\/games\/?tab=all\">1,516 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072182182\/recommended\/\">162 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072182182\/recommended\/293440\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">35.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 14, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>Elliot Quest<\/i> is a great neoretro game.  It's got beautiful big-pixeled graphics with a soothing earth tone palette.  The music is very nice.  The gameplay follows the framework of its primary inspiration, the unfairly snubbed <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link<\/i>, while outdoing it in nearly every way:  better challenge balance, ten times the enemy diversity, a more sensible level-up system, the list could go on.  The most impressive thing is that though <i>Elliot Quest<\/i> is astoundingly organic (no copy-paste), the game is very long, with tons of hidden content to uncover (extra bosses, secret items, etc.)<br><br>So taken was I with <i>Elliot Quest<\/i> that I was on the verge of calling it the next <i>Cave Story<\/i> -- that is, until I reached the tired, brief, depressing ending.  It made me very sad, because it undercut the rest of the game so much!  And I even got the &quot;good&quot; ending (apparently, it gets worse)!  As fun as the ride was, I will probably never play this again because of the hateful and hackneyed finale.  Childish?  Perhaps, but I believe that an epic fantasy quest calls for an appropriately epic conclusion, and anything less is unacceptable (a SHMUP or an arcade brawler shouldn't have to worry much  about this, obviously, though it should still not end in a needlessly depressing manner).  <br><br>Dumb ending aside, you should get this lovingly handcrafted game when it is on sale; it fills the <i>Adventure of Link<\/i> niche like no other modern game I've played and we need more like it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13981390', 'summary' );

Being a huge fan of the original, I was so excited to dig into the sequel despite knowing nothing about it. For years it was one of my biggest NES disappointments, being too hard and too confusing for my elementary-aged self. I've learned to appreciate it in the intervening years, as well as similar games from the era like Simon's Quest and Journey to Olympus. I only bring this up because Elliot Quest has done an amazing job of refreshing all those memories, good and bad alike.<br><br>You play Elliot, a terminally ill youth on a quest to maybe save himself through divine intervention. There's a pretty rich and developed world to explore that contains four guardians that might have the key to saving Elliot's life, and it's your job to guide him through those forgotten places, and the cliffs and caves that lead to them, mostly unscathed. The world map is huge, with tons of locations of interest, side areas, secret areas, and even enemy encounters.<br><br>Elliot's default weapon is a bow that fires in an arc, but you gain experience from enemies that can be used to upgrade your attack (and movement and health and magic) that can make it fire faster or straighter. You'll also pick up magic spells, items like bombs and potions, and abilities like double jumps from the many locales you visit. Almost every single area has alternate paths and secrets accessible only with the right powers, so you'll have plenty of reasons to revisit parts of the world.<br><br>There are SO many paths and secrets, in fact, that it can often be hard to tell where you're supposed to go next. My main complaint about Elliot and his Quest is the difficulty, and it's a two-fold issue. The game dumps you in a wide-open world with a fairly clear path to the first temple, but after that there are tons of caves and forts and forests and cliffs that may or may not be the path ahead. You'll need to be very familiar with your abilities to know how to proceed, and many of them are creative enough to make that difficult. Your reward from the first major area, for example, is unlike most powers found in platformers and takes a good bit of experimentation to understand.<br><br>Even if you know where you're going, though, there's no guarantee you can get there alive. Elliot Quest can be very difficult at times, with a major spike around the second temple that came as a shock to me. Some enemies are posed in ways that make them almost impossible to avoid, and invincible enemies start appearing with more and more frequency the further in you get. Checkpoints are plentiful but you lose XP every time you die, a particularly brutal punishment considering how challenging some sequences can be. After a few hours my problem wasn't so much where to go, as my options being almost too difficult to face.<br><br>It's pretty remarkable how faithfully Elliot Quest follows in The Adventure of Link's footsteps, down to the confounding levels and difficulty spikes. They're both games that demand a lot of time and attention to appreciate, but are undeniably worth it in the end. Elliot Quest has an absurd amount of secrets and side content to uncover, all presented in charming pixel graphics and pleasing ambiance. If you like your retro platformers challenging and engrossing, you'll get all that and then some here.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21547603', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21547603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21547603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21547603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21547603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21547603', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21547603_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21547603_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30802941\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198024989523\/recommended\/293440\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"64723795\">mauro7inf<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 27.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a fantastic Zelda II\/metroidvania adventure.  It was lots of fun to play, very addictive, and it only became a drag at the very end when trying to beat the superbosses.  I 100%ed this game (well, I didn't get all the coin chests or all the endings, but I don't think that counts) and I have to say, I enjoyed it quite a bit!  I did not use guides for most of it; I did get lost at one point and used a guide there, and I also got guidance for the superbosses and the final crystals, but other than that, a careful explorer can get pretty much everything.  So:<br><br>Things I liked: the metroidvania gameplay, obviously, is the main draw.  It's not a straight metroidvania: each area is self-contained.  Basically, there's an overworld map filled with impassable areas raising exclamation points, and you go into these places to cross the map to the other side of that impassable area.  These areas often have challenges requiring the use of upgrades or spells, so you may not be able to cross them at first but have to come back with better stuff.  The game also has a nifty story told in flashbacks, a karma meter (which I never got to move), EXP and level-ups (it would have been nice to know what's actually important to have late-game, because you get 1 skill point at level-up and with the level cap you can only get some of the upgrades).  Also, every new thing on the map is exciting to explore and discover!  I guess that's what kept me playing for so many hours.<br><br>Things I didn't really like: the lack of direction.  The game is deliberately designed with a &quot;retro&quot; feel.  I honestly wish developers would stop doing that.  I buy the simplicity in graphics, that's fine, but the game could well have explained more.  For example, at one point you can find a blue book.  It goes into your upgrade grid.  What does it do?  The forums aren't sure.  The game sure doesn't tell you!  I think, for the most part, you can kinda figure out where to go by just looking around on the map, but maybe also someone in the towns could kinda say something to point you in the right direction too?  You also collect crystals -- why?  What's the point?  Turns out they open doors if you have enough of them, OK.  So they're... door counters?<br><br>Other things of note: the game is pretty hard.  There are lots of puzzles, lots of challenging platforming, etc.  There's a very nice Hell-Temple-esque challenge area that's quite a bit harder than the rest of the game.  And then there are... the superbosses.  MASSIVE DIFFICULTY SPIKE, even compared to the Wizard's Tower.  They're not required, of course, but yeah.  My last week of playing this game was spent getting frustrated against one of these guys for a bit and giving up for the night.  On the other hand, it felt damn good to kill the last one and open the door they were guarding!<br><br>Anyway, I had a lot of fun playing Elliot Quest.  Other than those superbosses, the challenge level is great, though you may want to look things up on occasion in case you missed something big (I missed a crucial game mechanic, for example, that nobody bothered to tell me about in-game).

Gorgeous, packed with areas to explore, and sporting an array of multifaceted items with uses both in and out of combat.  An easy recommendation to anyone who likes platformers or Zelda-likes (it's an obvious homage to Zelda 2).<br><br>The difficulty can be a bit steep, and, as you'll see the other reviews here mention, you're often lost as to what's next.  The engine has some quirks, too (for me some sound effects appear and disappear from day to day).  But, if you're willing to work with a few rough edges, and not above glancing at a walkthrough occasionally, you'll be rewarded with a jewel of a game.  I'm playing through it a second time now, and I feel it's a real shame more people haven't heard of it.

The gameplay is solid, with good 2D shooting action, and the level up system is very good and dynamic. The boss fights are fun and each one is different, and each area gives you a different feel, but now for the bad points.<br><br>1. This game does not hold you hand, in the slightest. While hand-holding (I'm looking at you, Navi) is generally discouraged in games nowadays, I'd still like to know what the heck I am doing, or what a powerup does that I just got. Occasionally, the game will tell you, but othertimes it doesn't. I picked up this book atop a mountain that, after completing the game, I still have no clue what it does. Further, when the game starts, there's basically no cutscene or story, you just find yourself in a forest (more on this later) and have no idea what is going on. I went to the left, and before I knew it was on the overworld map, wandering around aimlessly. Eventually I went back and did the area, but this happens ALOT in this game. You'll explore and explore until you are blue in the face, only hitting wall after wall until you give up and look online where you are supposed to go next. Also, once, I went through this temple and afterwards it said a new area had opened for me in the East. Where? What area? A little cutscene or a show on the map would have helped tremendously. This game desperately needed an Exclamation point on the Overworld just to tell you where you can go next. All the great open world exploration games do this. Fallout 3, Zelda games, Skyrim...They all tell you where you can go next if you get bored or lost, but don't force you to go there. This is a simple feature that, if the developer makes a 2.0, I'd highly recommend.<br>2. The leveling system: Now, before I said the leveling system was good in its inner workings, but in the way that you level, I feel it is broken. When you die, you lose a % of your XP earned on the current level. AND all the enemies respawn. There were many times where I was stuck in an area that I had gotten too deep into (got halfway through and got a save stone) and then realized I was over my head and tried to go back, only to die a bunch and lose a bunch of XP. Or, in tough dungeons, you will die alot to monsters and traps, and so halfway through the game I realized I had to go to the next area, and it was kicking my butt. So then I had to farm for XP. Luckily, I discovered an exploit in the mountains where you can grind a level for only a few minutes of grinding, but this should not have happened. Half the problem is that when you go to a save point, you only get half health and half magic. The original Metroid did not refill your health at save stations, and there is a reason no game has imitated it since. It either leads to boring grinding for health, or that you die alot. So when you die, these three things happen: 1. Lose some XP, 2. Enemies respawn, 3. Down to half health and half magic. This means that it is very easy to get into death cycles, and get behind in the XP game. My simple suggestion to the developer would be to simply eliminate the lose in XP AND to give full health at save stones. Or least create two difficulty settings, where the easier one did as I suggested.<br>3. The story. Now, I love stories where you wake up and know nothing and it is slowly revealed to you who you are and why you are here. My favorite game of all time is System Shock 2, and it did this, but it needs to make sense, or at least have some story to start you out with. This game literally just starts. Bam. Time to play. That's ok, but it doesn't make sense from a story perspective, since, as it becomes revealed, you didn't have amnesia or anything, and thus should have known the story from the beginning. Now I am not opposed to telling the story over the course of the game to not bog-down the beginning, but something would have been nice. Some little cutscene, 20 seconds. Even Sonic 3 has a small cutscene at the beginning. Later, in dungeons, alot of the story is told in text while you are playing, and half the time I miss it, but it is so vague that it doesn't make sense until almost the end of the game. Again, my suggestion to the developer would be to add a simply 20 second cuscene at the beginning so that the player can get their bearings as to the general plot.<br>4. The final boss fight: The final boss fight is probably the most boring slog of a boss fight you will ever face. Once you figure out his patterns, he is easy, but he has like 8 different attacks, and, if I understand correctly (looked at an walkthough online), you can only damage him on ONE of them. And they are totally random. You can go for 5 minutes not being able to attack him, and man does that get boring fast. And that one time her actually does the attack you can hurt him on, and you screw up and do no or little damage? Well, welcome to 5 more minutes of not being able to attack him. It...just...won't...end. It is also disappointing that, over the course of the game, you gain all of these spells, but only one of them actually does anything in the battle.  My suggestion to the developer is to change the random % that procs the attack you can actually damage him to 50%, or at least 25%, but it feels like right now it is somewhere between 5-10%, and that makes the battle drag on forever.<br>5. A Warp System: This game deperately needed the ability to warp to and from locations. Sometimes, you get stuck in a place that is too tough for you, and you just want out, but you're stuck. A few key areas, containing portals, would have been awesome. One time, I climbed this tall mountain full of tough enemies and I finally ascended to find a strange building, and when I went to open it...It's locked, and I don't have the key. So now I have to scramble down the mountain, find the key, and go back up, AGAIN. If, by climbing, I had activated a portal, so that I would never need to climb again, not having the key would not have been so annoying as it was.<br><br>So, after all of that, why do I recommend this game? Overall, the game was fun, but exceptionally frustrating at parts, and while some of the deeper game elements could be improved, my main gripes with the game where simple things, some of which would require very little effort to fix, and thus aren't deep-rooted problems. It's unfortunate these problems made it through playtesting. Thus my recommendation has an * attached.

As others have mentioned, this does have a Zelda 2 vibe. But, expect to enjoy a Metroid vibe as well. Lots of exploration for loot and upgrades. The game throws you into the environment, and the world is your oyster! You can make it as difficult or as smoothe as you'd like, depending on what stats in which you invest and progressive upgrades you have.<br><br>So, the easiest way I've found to outline a game's points is to list the pros and cons...<br><br>Pros:<br>- 8-bit feel with near-modern control scheme<br>- Lots of exploration, lots of upgrades, lots of secrets<br>- Great boss fights...and lots of 'em. There are 4 main dungeons before unlocking the last, but plenty of other side dungeons. Each dungeon comes with at least 1 boss; some have mini-bosses as well. It's a weird construct, but it definitely works.<br>- It's unconventional. Yes, it resembles Zelda 2 and Metroid, but it has its own style. It doesn't hold your hand...it has very little in-game prompting. You need to discover things for youself.<br><br>Cons:<br>- Honestly, I really can't think of any. For an indie title, it feels polished and rewarding...Great job!<br><br>In summary, for $10 and nearly 24 hours until the final cutscene  (not 100% - other higher level areas to explore), this game pays dividends. That's what I love about Steam. These little-known games creep into your &quot;Recommended&quot; list, and, after perusing the reviews, you're enjoying another hidden gem! Pick it up; give it a try.<br><br>Just an addendum with regard to another game Elliot Quest feels like...not the difficulty...the construct. Dark Souls. There were only a few, but, in the negative reviews, a common &quot;complaint&quot; existed...unreachable areas and circuitous routes to backtrack. In its defense, the game is intentionally designed to have barriers between sections of the world. And, after exploration and lots of enemy fights, shortcuts begin to appear...much like Dark Souls. The first playthrough of an area is a real challenge, twisting your character through a maze. But, as you unlock the shortcuts, the map and game design begin to unfold before your eyes. I view this as a postive for sure!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28248910', 'recent_short' );

Polished, fun, and VERY good pacing.<br><br>This game will obviously take from games from the past - but not in a cheap nostalgia sense - in a sense that it takes the best parts of a good dessert to make an absolutely perfect finished products. The sum of it's parts is much greater than some of the obvious inspiration. <br><br>One of the most helpful reviews almost discouraged my purchase, and I'd like to address some of those points from the perspective of an absolutely ravenous consumer of metroidvania and platformer games.<br><br>Experience loss on death does suck, a little bit. It sucks more, at first, but you'll NEVER have to grind. I spent 20 minutes grinding out levels early on, frustrated with a boss - nearly 3\/4 of the way through the game, I was max level. You'll never, ever NEED to grind, and will hit max level through normal play. You also retain experience when you die and go back to a check point, so rather than as punishing as zelda II or many other games with death=reload, it's actually pretty nice unless you're trying to zerg your way through something. On death, you seem to lose about 10% of your XP towards the next level.<br><br>I never at any point found a pit that didn't have some sort of visual hint that dropping down it offered rewards.<br>In the same way, many of the other hidden areas are clearly marked - the walls are cracked, or the shadow stops at the entrance to the secret area, etc. Classic metroid tropes label almost all secrets, and you won't be forced to ever run into walls - your arrows won't stick to anything you can interact with or pass through, so if your arrow dissapears, investigate. This is only necessary if you don't have a very keen eye - I had no issue 100%ing this game over the course of... oh god, 28 hours in 3 days. You will be locked out of some areas, a lot in the beginning, but at no point did it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 me off, just made me wonder what would get me around that, I never felt stuck or frustrated that I couldn't advance through something. <br><br>As for random activation abilities - some of them, like occasionally double health\/magic collection, average out to be very helpful. Others, like half damage 30% of the time, I skipped entirely, as the earlier perk required to get health regen was far, far too unreliable. You won't be able to take all the perks - skip the ones that don't sound helpful.<br><br>Some reviews were critical of items without descriptions - all items in the game are pretty obvious. Again, in following the metroid trope, every main item you get or usable item you get traps you in a room forcing you to use it to get out. Some of the very non-obvious ones, dash, and one other, had a tome describing how to use it near it. <br><br>The only item that's really a mystery is the blue book, which is optional, and extremely hidden. Some folks think it makes you magic regen faster.<br><br>The boss battles throughout the game were tough, especially the optional ones, but rarely frustrating - classicly difficult bosses that are well patterned, or well telegraphed makes it much, much less frustrating to deal with - pay attention to what you're looking at, the boss will tell you what it's going to do. The only really frustrating thing for me was that many of the optional bosses are very, very far from potion shops, and don't include a full heal save point, which just seemed mean - it's worth noting, try the boss several times before you take any of your potions, for your own sake and time.<br><br>A lot of this review has been spent contrasting against other reviews - I have trouble seeing how anyone who's a great fan of the metroidvania genre could toss this aside - this game was absolutely, completely amazing end to end. I had so much fun figuring out every little puzzle, never feeling as challenged as La Mulana or Environmental Station Alpha left me to google up answers - and the puzzles constantly evolved from block puzzles to shadow puppet puzzles to an area of the game that was clearly just frogger. The way puzzles evolved throughout this game was a huge testament to what made all the zelda games so popular, and so absolutely perfectly executed.<br><br>my only real criticism is that it started a little slow - it's hard to figure out exactly what you're doing. Just push forward, it'll come to you. (go right, not left, at the start) You have two hours before you have to decide to return it, so I'd heavily advise, unlike some negative reviews, you give it 90 minutes of good, hard playing and see how you feel. <br><br>This game is a masterpiece, and again, if you like metroidvania games, you owe it to yourself to give this a fair shake - it's a brilliant game and long enough to feel absolutely worth the 9.99.<br><br>Some final thoughts\/spoilers\/helpful tips - <br>There are 3 endings, depending on your character karma. You can look it up if you want to aim for something, but usually it's pretty obvious what is good and not good. Don't rob people if you want to be good, you will overflow with money by the end of the game anyhow. <br>The only not so obvious thing - A goddess will at some point ask you to turn back. turning back is good, and the only way to get a specific item. If you don't, this item is permanently lost. I wish the game had detailed this.<br>At one point you will be in a cave and it will be all dark and shadowy, the whole foreground will be black. Don't light the torch in this cave or you cannot complete this little side area. These are the only really rough missable things that come up on the whole adventure, and neither is required to finish, but both are required for 100% item collection.<br>Game keys are NOT remappable, but although I'm familiar with xpadder and have used it many times to compensate for bad keying, I loved the key layout in this game and didn't need to. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25458030', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25458030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25458030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25458030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25458030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25458030', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25458030_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25458030_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/293440\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 107 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["12890618","20605636","14011874","21349142","25962850","13981390","12907875","12953770","12958493","21547603"]}
