I enjoy a mix of a good story with good gameplay, quality audio and visuals also help but if a game lacks in that department I can forgive it. <i>Demon Hunter 3: Revelation<\/i> is the third in this series and so far I haven\u2019t been fully impressed with the titles. The first one I didn\u2019t enjoy much and the second was fun but could have been better, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this title. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised, and I found it to be the best game in the trilogy. While the story is still the weakest point, the game is overall a good package. You don\u2019t need to play the first two to enjoy this installment but it can\u2019t hurt to be up-to-date on things.<br><br>The main character is once again Dawn Ashmore, an orphan with mysterious red eyes who works as a demon hunter. The story is set twenty five years after her first adventure and for the past five years since the second game she\u2019s been living a peaceful life. This peace ends when Dawn's detective friend calls her to the scene of a murder where the victim\u2019s daughter was kidnapped because the evidence pointed to the supernatural. Indeed, Dawn finds herself in another battle with demons in a race to save the child\u2019s life. Along the way, she finds clues to her own past that have come back to haunt her on this very case. I enjoyed the how the story shed some light on Dawn\u2019s past but she still doesn\u2019t have much personality. What\u2019s worse, the game ends with a lot of loose ends and the bonus chapter doesn\u2019t answer any of them since it takes place before the main events in the story. Despite being a tad bit cliche, and the final demon being completely underwhelming, it was a good story for the game to cover.<br><br>What I really enjoyed, however, was the gameplay. It takes what worked well in the previous games and expands upon that. The hidden object scenes offer a nice variety of ways to play, using lists or even shadows and other gimmicks. Things were kept fresh from scene to scene and the you never had to play a hidden object scene twice either. The game also offers plenty of puzzles, most of which aren\u2019t too difficult or frustrating to players. Your inventory system is there as well, with interactive items which almost like small puzzles themselves as you need to find and combine items to make new ones. The game has a useful map which allows teleporting and shows you areas of interest depending on what difficulty you play one; you have three to choose from as well as a custom option. There are also plenty of collectables to find hidden around the game and bonus features where you can replay certain hidden objects or puzzles whenever you like.<br><br>The visuals of the game are great, everything is dark and spooky fitting the tone of the story well. The characters are still a bit stiff when they walk and talk but there has been notable improvements since the previous titles. Despite having a darker tone, I found I had no trouble finding items while playing the hidden object scenes which is very important since I have bad eyes. The audio also wraps up the package, the music fits and most of the voice acting is just fine. There are no glaring issues with the audio or visuals that hinder how the game is played.<br><br>Aside from being a bit of a nitpick when it comes to the story, my biggest issue with <i>Demon Hunter 3: Revelation<\/i> is that it\u2019s rather short. I finished the main game and bonus chapter in under three hours. However, because I enjoyed playing the game as much as I did it really didn\u2019t feel that short. I was surprised to see I had clocked in such a small amount of time, the game felt longer. And in the end that\u2019s what counts, sure it was a short game but it was time well spent. If you\u2019ve played the other two installments then I recommend grabbing this one as well, or even if you\u2019re new to the <i>Demon Hunter<\/i> franchise. If you play the game on Steam you will be treated to trading cards as well as plenty achievements to hunt after. I personally look forward to more adventures with Dawn, her story is shaping up very well.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Usagi\u2019s Rating<\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Must buy.<br><\/li><li><b>A good game to buy.<\/b><br><\/li><li>Only buy if on sale.<br><\/li><li>Mediocre.<br><\/li><li>Avoid at all costs.<\/li><\/ul><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/lunarproduction.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Lunar Productions<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28844724', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28844724' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28844724\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28844724' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28844724\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28844724', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28844724_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28844724_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28325966\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">Vic=HKC=<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/games\/?tab=all\">2,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/\">343 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/527420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHere's the last chapter in Dawn Ashmore's story. After finding why her adoptive father died and defeating twice Ragnar, Dawn was called by her friend, Officer Brown (who was trying to arrest her in the previous game), to investigate a supernatural disappearance and find a little girl with red-eyes too. Revelation will give answers to Dawn: who were her parents.<br><br>Artifex Mundi is publishing this trilogy on Steam but remember how it began: the first game was plagued (and still is) with bad translation. But the second game corrected everything, apart that there were some plotholes.<br><br>Revelation is set 25 years after the first game and 5 years after the second one. Dawn lost her precious amulet but she's still good with magic. However, the story is badly written: while the idea of discovering Dawn's real past is nice, the rest is just non-sense. You don't know why Officer Brown was kidnapped, you don't know why Father Jones was murdered, the man that was scared in the greenhouse is just useless and the end is very abrupt: how come your ancient enemy is now willing to help you, like that, without even speaking together or something like that. Was it for the bonus chapter? But the bonus chapter is involving Brown before calling Dawn.<br><br>Besides, Dawn's appearance is always changing and not even sticking to her original design. I'm not saying that the graphics are bad, they're quite creepy and nice but for the cutscenes, Dawn isn't even close to what she should have looked. Even her portrait is different from reality, when the other characters have the same form than in the previous\/current game. Why Dawn got a different treatment?<br><br>The gameplay is quite the same: pick items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes (with one that I've liked as it was finding items to move), solve puzzles. Minigames are easy, hidden objects scenes are good. The hunt for special objects is also interesting : scary dolls, coins that will open a chest, portraits with characters from the past and present and a biography.<br><br>But even the biographies are wrong: the priest is called Father Jones in the game but he has a different name in the portrait. Same for the doc inside the manor: he's called Hughes but is Andrew or Scott in the biography.<br><br>Anyway, the soundtrack is nice and voice acting is good.<br><br>But you bet that after a bad start with translation and a good second opus, Revelation is just... a big let down. The story has many plotholes, nothing seems coherent. I've still enjoyed it but yeah, the trilogy Demon Hunter is probably not the best in Artifex Mundi's publishing catalogue.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28325966', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28325966' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28325966\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28325966' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28325966\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28325966', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28325966_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28325966_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30136091\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"213192043\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06f144ad372e947a46e154fa6e7f27301688681a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06f144ad372e947a46e154fa6e7f27301688681a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06f144ad372e947a46e154fa6e7f27301688681a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/\" data-miniprofile=\"213192043\">moon2stars<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/games\/?tab=all\">346 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/recommended\/527420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe graphics were good.
