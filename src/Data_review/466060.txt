Originally released in 2011, the game holds up incredibly well even by today\u2019s standards.  An excellent example of a hidden object and adventure game hybrid (HOPA), it appeals to both HOG and Adventure gamers alike.  With a chilling story that lacks  the campiness of other games, somewhat challenging point \u2018n\u2019 click gameplay, and breathtakingly gorgeous artwork, there\u2019s very little for me to complain about when it comes to this classic of the hidden object genre.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=710077539\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=710077539<\/a><br>Everything about Vanishing Hitchhiker screams quality, from the realistically painted landscapes and beautifully decaying building interiors to the atmospherically creepy sound design and soundtrack, a lot of love went into this game.  Even the few lines of spoken narration are acted without the over the top melodrama we so often get in the genre.  That\u2019s to say nothing of the story, which is an interesting take on ghostly hitchhiker tales, and it refreshingly goes in an unexpected direction to boot. I truly wish the game were longer, as 6 hours in Gordon Creek wasn\u2019t nearly long enough for this lover of creepy horror stories.<br> <br>Although gameplay is your standard HOPA fare, I felt the challenge of the adventure elements was slightly higher than I\u2019m used to in these titles, at least on Advanced mode.  While the plentiful hidden object scenes are helpfully denoted with sparkles, there were many a time I found myself wandering without a clue as to how to proceed, and had embarrassingly resorted to the HINT button more times than I\u2019m willing to admit.  However, the game nudges you along if you\u2019re stumped for too long and will sparkle on areas of interest if you\u2019ve been sitting without progress for an extended period of time.  Normally, I\u2019d be annoyed with this unrequested help, especially on Advanced mode, but I found it more than welcome here as the intricately detailed images sometimes make it difficult to figure out where to focus on next. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=711287270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=711287270<\/a><br>Outside of the lack of achievements, which is something I always champion for here on Steam, my sole complaint is with the low resolution of the game screen.  Of course, this was released before wide screen was the industry standard, and most casual gamers were playing on older monitors and systems. Unfortunately, that means you either play in a smaller Windowed Mode which maintains the beauty of the original graphical resolution, or stretched out in Widescreen Mode.  Thankfully, there\u2019s a Widescreen Correction option that un-stretches the image, but it places black bars on either side of the screen.  Although I personally find that preferable to playing with the gorgeous artwork stretched out, fuzzy, and distorted, you\u2019re not going to get an unaltered 1920 x 1080 image from the game, which may be unacceptable for some players. <br><br>If you\u2019re looking for a good, creepy, hidden object adventure with a story that\u2019s unsettling without being over-the-top cheesy, Vanishing Hitchhiker is your game.  Despite playing it years ago over at Big Fish, I loved it just as much (if not more) my second time through, and I know without a doubt I\u2019ll be visiting Gordon Creek again and again.  Now, if only the other games in the Shiver series make it over to Steam, my life may well be complete.  <br><br>Bottom Line: Highly Recommended to both hidden object and adventure gamers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24519588', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24519588' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24519588\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24519588' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24519588\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24519588', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24519588_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24519588_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23548702\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">Vic=HKC=<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/games\/?tab=all\">2,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/\">343 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/466060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was pure luck that I recognized this game as being one probably published by Big Fish Games. Indeed, I've come back to Neoseeker and I am currently adding many casual adventures\/HO games. The series Shiver was one of these planned to be added soon. By releasing the game here, BFG prompted me to quicken the process.<br><br>However, I couldn't resist the purchase, as it was close to the kind of ambiance I prefer for this kind of game. So, in the end, was it really worth of my wallet?<br><br>You took a hitchhiker with you and let her go at Gordon Creek. However, the teddy bear she forgets looked like one in your childhood and decided to give it back to the mysterious girl. But did you really expect to find her easily in that gloomy and deserted town?<br><br>The plot was beginning well: a mysterious sad woman, a teddy bear, a gloomy town, anything that can be tied to a psychological game, with people being used for experiments... My imagination was running so wild that in the end, the story seemed to be a little disappointing. I still don't understand why the little boy leads you to finish your quest, when you're clearly on your way to find the truth. And the extra chapter should have been included in the main story. It would have been more logical for the plot.<br><br>Anyway, the gameplay is the same as any other game of the kind: you find items, you use them, you solve puzzles, though they're rare, you clear hidden objects scenes. The novelty here is the fact that you're carrying a flashlight and a camera with you, used to lit darker areas and to take pictures. You can take them anytime but there are moments where you need to do that to go forward. Generally, it will blink to show you that you need the picture of a vision or a ghost.<br><br>If I have a regret, it's probably for the hidden objects scenes: some objects aren't really visible and given the dark nature of the game, it's not really helping.<br><br>The graphics are really good for the ambiance, though I would have probably liked a more developed burial site. It would have strengthened the supernatural side than what happened in the town or on the island.<br><br>The soundtrack is really nice too and very fitting. However, the voice acting could have been better: I didn't feel like the man had really emotions.<br><br>As a collector's edition, you'll find the bonus chapter, concept arts, etc.. Nothing really extraordinary, as some other games are more furnished for that domain.<br><br>Anyway, Shiver: Vanishing Hitchhiker disappointed me because I was expecting something else but is a good moment to pass. However, I find the price a little too high for what it is really.  I do hope that Big Fish Games will finally understand that participating in sales on Steam can be a good idea, like they did with Mystery Cases Files, where I ended up buying those discounted. Because if they're discounting other games like Awakening, Dark Tales, Otherworld or even Dark Parables, I would acquire them without problems.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23548702', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23548702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23548702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23548702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23548702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23548702', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23548702_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23548702_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/466060\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24519588","23548702"]}
