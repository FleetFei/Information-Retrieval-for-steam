Landing is especially difficult as the lander does not respond well to the key commands. When you start the actual landing, get on the W and D keys immediately or you won't make it to the target zone. My only other complaint is that the rover moves far too fast to be realistic and you must do all the driving; there's no instruction programming interface as there is in TKOM. <br><br>There is no manual and no instructions other than what appear on the screen as you play, so I've extracted them, slightly edited, from the game files.<br><br>The capsule carrying the rover has entered the Martian atmosphere. Prepare to land the capsule safely in the landing zone using the arrow keys or the W,A,S and D keys to steer the capsule towards the landing zone. When the capsule is close enough to the ground, open the parachute with the spacebar.<br> <br>When you have control of the rover, move it forwards and backwards using the W and S keys. Use the A and D keys to turn left and right. Change the camera angle by pressing and holding the right mouse button and then moving the mouse. You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel. Take the rover for a test drive to get used to the controls. Drive to the circle indicated on your screen.<br> <br>Next, take some photographs of the surroundings. Press 2 to switch to camera mode. Take 15 photos of the area by pressing the spacebar to take a photo. Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel. Since you can take a maximum of 50 photos before running out of memory, transmit your photographs back to Earth after each expedition. To successfully transmit them you\u2019ll need to ensure that you\u2019ve got full reception. On the lower left of the interface you\u2019ll see a signal strength indicator. Drive around with the rover until you\u2019re able to get a full signal (five green bars). When you find a place where the reception is good enough to transmit your photographs back to Earth, click on \u201cinventory\u201d on the lower left of the interface and then on \u201cphotos\u201d. View your photographs, delete any you don\u2019t like, then transmit the rest to Earth by clicking on the \u201ctransmit all photos\u201d button.<br> <br>Now drive back to the green circle to start the next mission, rock hunting. Collect some rock samples. Find a small rock and maneuver the rover so that it\u2019s within reach, then press 3 to use the claw. Use the A and D keys to rotate the arm left and right. You can raise and lower both parts of the arm with the Q,E,W and S keys. Press the spacebar to pick up an object.<br> <br>Now you\u2019ve got a rock. Press Enter to place it in your inventory. You can then view the rock in your inventory by clicking on \u201cinventory\u201d on the lower left of the interface. Collect four more rock samples using the claw.<br> <br>Take soil samples next. Press 4 to use the drill. Using the A and D keys, rotate the arm left and right. Raise and lower both parts of the arm with the Q, E, W and S keys. Press the spacebar to activate the drill. As you drill, the dust you extract will be placed directly in your inventory.<br> <br>Drive back to the green circle to start the next mission, which is to take a closer look at the terrain. Satellite photos of this area show a number of strange objects. Explore the valley to the south and find them. Sounds from unknown sources have been detected in this area. Maybe they\u2019re connected to the strange objects in the satellite photos. Explore the area. You should be able to see glowing rocks ahead; they must be the strange objects in the satellite photos. Use the claw to take a sample.<br> <br>Satellite photos show three more glowing rocks. Find them and take samples of each for a total of four samples of these artifacts. Take 25 more photos and transmit them back to Earth.<br> <br>The entrance to a large cave lies to the southeast. Drive there. It\u2019s dark in the cave and visibility is poor; press the N key to switch to infrared mode. Explore the cave, carefully. Since no sunlight reaches the interior of the cave, the solar cells can\u2019t be recharged. The yellow glowing mineral crystals seem like they may be an energy  source; you might be able to charge the solar cells with them instead. Collect 10 samples.<br> <br>Sensors indicate that there may be frozen water nearby. Take a core sample if you come across any ice. The seismograph just recorded a powerful earthquake. Get the rover out of the cave as fast as you can before it caves in.<br> <br>Storage containers for the samples are all full. The samples must be transported back to Earth. Return to the landing zone. Watch out for whirlwinds on the way, and drive the rover onto the platform. The return capsule is ready to take off but it's very windy. Use the arrow keys to steer against the wind and prevent the capsule from crashing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29680628', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29680628' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29680628\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29680628' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29680628\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29680628', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29680628_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29680628_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/587330\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29680628"]}
