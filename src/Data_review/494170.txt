Players find themselves as Yasunari, a student at the school Miniature Garden. While preparing for the school's Miniature festival with his childhood friend Ayana they discuss a few weird things that have happened before around the time of the festival. You're quite sure there's nothing to support these rumors and tales of horrid accidents, but could you be wrong? You'll find yourself questioning what you know at every turn as each path reveals different information and can result in an overall change in the reality you enter and hopefully leave.<br><br>Pros:<br>Rivetting story: While perusing the game it was difficult to pry myself away from the story and focus on finding errors. Depending on your choices the context of your adventure changes, more so than what may be for a visual novel, so it can be hard to tell if the ending you get is good or bad. There is still one ending that trumps the rest however and it's as sweetly satisying as it should be.<br>Characters: The way this characters introduces and portrays the characters is beautiful, both in sight and text. Lump of Sugar did an amazing job making adorable characters with a myriad of expressions and nailed it when they have psychological breakdowns or moments of stress. One second your friend smiles at you cutely and the next their eyes have no color, in a very upsetting change. The story behind each character is also quite the pleasant treat as you begin to question just who everyone is and what they're doing (especially yourself) until you slowly see things fall into place.<br>Length: If you're a one and done kind of person then this is not the format from you. While this Visual novel does have a 'best ending' each ending is viable in its own right and the story makes sure to have every option be a realistic ending, rather than endings that only increase in how much you know or end with. But if you just want the best ending and will never play again, do not buy. And for those of you willing to put in the effort for full completion, you should find exciting tales and a few special rewards for your hard work.<br><br>Cons:<br>Music: The music is not bad, but sometimes it may seem unfitting or gets tedious. I only list this as a con because for most of your journey you'll find the music to be bland, not surprising for a visual novel. It does have some very choice songs though, and when it really matters the game will hit you with powerful notes to strengthen surprise reveals, and long awaited success.<br>Relatability: This can vary for everyone, but sometimes the characters will do something that will drive you crazy. It's not uncommon for a visual novel to occasionally take the wheel, but no one asked for it to crash you into a tree. If you can manage to laugh at yourself then you should have no issue seeing yourself make decisions lacking in common sense against your will, but Isunari is under a lot of stress after all, right?<br><br>Summary: I'm sure the biggest question is &quot;Is this game worth it?&quot; If it's on sale, yes it absolutely is. Visual novels seem to be increasing in price lately but with even just a few bucks shaved off of this game it is more than well worth the money for the avid player. At full price? Consider it. It's not a visual novel that will blow you into the next dimension, but it doesn't try to be either. It very clearly knows what it's aiming to accomplish and does a fantastic job doing it. If you can find enjoyment in visual novels, and are looking for a good way to spend time, it'd be worth it. If you're maybe more on the casual side and stumbled around here by accident and are considering the purchase then it could be worth your money. I have no doubt everyone that buys this game after knowing what to expect will enjoy it, and those who know what to expect and think it isn't for them are right as well. This game does not make miracles, but it does make a helluva story.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30836410', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30836410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30836410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30836410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30836410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30836410', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30836410_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30836410_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30851767\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bireland2014\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"180770712\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bireland2014\/\" data-miniprofile=\"180770712\">bireland2014<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bireland2014\/games\/?tab=all\">150 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bireland2014\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bireland2014\/recommended\/494170\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJust finished this visual novel and overall it's not bad, the story characters and artstyle are all pretty good, the music is a little lacking though. I would say that it's a good visual to play if you are new to visual novels as it is relatively short and not too expensive to buy but to someone who is more experienced with visual novels it will probably come off as a bit lacking. So overall I don't think it is bad but I also think there are better mystery visual novels on steam such as Higurashi, Stein's; Gate and Root Double.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30851767', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30851767' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30851767\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30851767' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30851767\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30851767', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30851767_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30851767_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/494170\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30836410","30851767"]}
