A hidden gem.<\/div><br>Definitely a hidden gem. I first heard about this game when browsing Steam and right off the bat the art-style, gameplay, story &quot;rich&quot; content, and of course, the VAs instantly caught my attention. I downloaded the demo and enjoyed what I had played. It took me a while to purchase the game, but I am glad I did.<br><br>First off, this game is not meant for somebody wanting an in-depth RPG with a &quot;high quality&quot; combat system that focuses on exploration and dialogue choices. This game is strictly linear where the game pushes you in one-direction and only that direction. There are no side-quests and all the dialogue is used to tell the story that they are telling. There are no &quot;choices&quot; during conversations that affect the direction of the conversation. As much as I enjoy games with options such as that, there is also room in the gaming world for games that control what you do. This is a perfect example of that. (If you're expecting something else, then don't buy it. Or buy it and refund it if you don't enjoy it.) This game is almost an &quot;interactive story.&quot; And it is an amazing story. There is never a dull moment during the game and it isn't too short as too feel rushed and not too long as too feel drawn out. It was almost as if I was playing a book. There is a lot of dialogue betweens the characters and a lot of text if you choose to read the lore. The lore surrounding the world is actually interesting and collecting the tidbits of knowledge around the areas opens the world up and draws you in)<br><br>The Voice Acting is superb. This game has amazing VAs all-around excluding the obvious Matthew Mercer and Jennifer Hale.<br><br>There really isn't much I don't enjoy about the game. However, as most other reviewers point out, the combat isn't perfect. I personally didn't have many problems. I played on normal difficulty and, for the most part, it was pretty seamless (I could see hard being harder, obviously, but I don't think it would be too bad). It actually became pretty easy towards the end. I didn't have much micromanaging to do because I was able to build my companions to pretty much self-sustain themselves (Kalden is a great face-tank and has amazing AoE heals). That just left me to focus on using my abilities. I sometimes needed to control my companions, but that wasn't too often and it almost always worked out well. <br><br>Lastly, collectibles are a bit sporadic. It wasn't too bad and they were spread out far enough to allow you to read and not tire of reading the lore bits. However, the placements of the seemed pretty random, for the most part. Not a big deal though.<br><br>In the end, the game was amazing and I definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys a game focusing on story. And more people need to get this game, it deserves more attention that it has gotten.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30399983', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30399983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30399983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30399983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30399983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30399983', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30399983_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30399983_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25855332\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"28651267\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0b\/0b75cba4a50d12475ecfe716adedbf1e4afe97f6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0b\/0b75cba4a50d12475ecfe716adedbf1e4afe97f6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0b\/0b75cba4a50d12475ecfe716adedbf1e4afe97f6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/\" data-miniprofile=\"28651267\">Longstrider<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/games\/?tab=all\">88 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988916995\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tM. Stands for Masterpiece.<br><br>This game is wonderful. It's surely unusual because not many people do such games these days and that's why I think it got quite a few negative reviews. People mostly criticize gameplay and system features and surely there are some flaws, but that's irrelevant. The essence of this game is a STORY, and a truly heartfelt one. It's a story about people, their character and their relationship, about a fantasy world crafted with love and soul put in it. This game has really touched the strings of my souls and is a great proof that game development is truly a form of art.<br><br>TL;DR - If you want to play classic RPG with many choices, go Pillars of Eternity. If you prefer tactical fights with deep strategy and mechanics, play XCOM. If you desire to live through a breathtaking adventure alongside unforgettable characters with vibrant personalities in a meticulously designed and truly enchanting fantasy world, Masquerada: Songs and Shadows is your choice.<br><br>Characters: Every person in the game is vivid, they don't just SEEM alive, they actually ARE alive. Usually characters in games are developed by people who don't really have much social experience (or so it seems) and don't really understand how people's relationship work, but luckily that's not the case with Masquerada. Due to the small number of characters introduced the devs showed us each and every one of them with their virtues and flaws, with their own stories, in all their uniqueness. They may behave irrationally succumbing to their emotions, but that's realistic, that makes them more alive. These are not your typical &quot;heroes&quot; who despite having a few bad traits are 90% good, brave and righteous (or 90% evil). The characters of Masquerada, including main ones, are humans who lie, fear, despair, but also hope, fight for what they believe and, what's most important, they EVOLVE throughout the story, and that's exactly what makes them alive.<br><br>World: The world of Masquerada if full of minute details that make it much more vivid. A lot of information about the world's features as well as background lore given to us in a form of Cicero's records (or the ones he finds) is simply amazing. In-game we can only see a small part of this world, a city of Ombre with its rich history and peculiar society structure, all though-out very carefully. But we can also get a glimpse on the other nations and territories through the notes, and it gives us more or less full picture of the world, which is quite rare for such games. Numerous minor details and descriptions is what really made a strong impression on me.<br><br>Sound: Music is quite simple, but really fitting. It helps a lot to immerse in the atmosphere. And the voices! Damn, they're so good. They help to form images of characters so much better and really plays a great part in their vividness! The voice cast  is quite starry: Felicia Day, Liam O'Brien, Matthew Mercer and many other people lend their voices to the characters of Masquerada.<br><br>Visual Design: There are many bright colors in the game that in my opinion make the game even more lively. The art style is quite simple and yet eye-catching.<br><br>Mechanics: Combat system is not complicated at all: elemental tags work pretty straightforward, most descriptions are not overloaded with numbers (much to mucnhkins' distaste). AI is doing weird things sometimes so you always need to keep an eye on your party members, but with the help of tactical pause it's not that hard (may be annoying sometimes though). On the hard difficulty the game is\u2026well, hard. But perfectly manageable. I completed it on hard with the party of characters that I like for personalities rather than for abilities (don't get me wrong, I love all the main characters, but to take along some of them in some situations were more fitting that the others) and although it was a bit harder than if I always had a good-all-around party, it was by no means exceptionally difficult. Even if you think you had built your characters wrong, by the time it starts to matter there will be a skill reset option, so it's quite user-friendly.<br><br>Story: I dare to say that people who designed the story are true geniuses. There are quite a few twists and turns of the plot, with many tales unfolding along the main storyline, closely intertwining with it and eventually everything being woven into the grand canvas of an adventure one can never forget. It's not particularly complicated or always unpredictable (some moments are really mind-blowing), but it somehow absorbs you. And, what's important, it's perfectly logical. Not rational, but logical, and definitely realistic. Many important questions arise as you progress and later you can see what answers Cicero and his friends find, how they resolve difficult situations and how it all affects them. All the characters' personalities as well as the word's lore are instrumental in creating this unique feeling of involvement in the story, the feeling of living through it.<br><br>Verdict: It's one of the best games I've ever played. I even see it not like a game, but rather an experience I lived through myself. In my opinion this masterpiece can actually influence one's perception, maybe teach some lessons and is definitely a source of inspiration. I doubt I managed to describe the game in all its brilliance and that's why I encourage everyone seeking a vibrant story to try out this game.<br><br>To the Developers: Thank you guys for creating such a magnificent game. It was a truly unforgettable experience, Cicero and his friends now hold a special place in my heart.<br><br>Rating: \u221e\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25855332', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25855332' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25855332\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25855332' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25855332\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25855332', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25855332_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25855332_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25833221\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/idiobrando\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"55062081\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ee\/ee4c922f126809fcbb766aeae4faecb3c596a837.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ee\/ee4c922f126809fcbb766aeae4faecb3c596a837.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ee\/ee4c922f126809fcbb766aeae4faecb3c596a837_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/idiobrando\/\" data-miniprofile=\"55062081\">I AKU!<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/idiobrando\/games\/?tab=all\">592 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/idiobrando\/recommended\/\">212 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/idiobrando\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was a backer for Masquerada\u2019s Kickstarter campaign at the basic game tier, and it\u2019s yet another quality Kickstarter game that I would have thrown some more money at if I knew it was going to be this good.<br><br>Masquerada is a Real Time with Pause RPG that feels more like a JRPG to me in structure. The game is very linear, there are no sidequests, dialogue choices, and world maps and stuff like that. But that is not really a negative, because Masquerada makes sure that the journey is a real engaging one. When it comes to the combat the game still needs some work, mainly in that unlike in most RTwP RPGs you can\u2019t select your whole party. This becomes an issue because the Party AI is rather weak and won\u2019t get out of the way of stuff like AoE attacks. On Normal this isn\u2019t much of a problem, but I\u2019d advise against playing on Hard for the time being. Also a few bosses and enemies seem rather unbalanced, able to do obscene amounts of damage that just feels kind of broken. (Like one mid-game boss does more damage than even the final boss does.) The core of the combat is quite fun though, it\u2019s fast paced and feels good, especially the late game when you have real good abilities. So any problems the combat has can probably be fixed, the devs have said they\u2019ll be on it. The game also has no manual saves, which is a rather dumb decision nowadays. (Though it never became problem for me) But yet again that\u2019s a problem that can be patched. (Hell Shadowrun had that same problem too at first, and I love Shadowrun.) I\u2019ve also ran into some bugs, one game-breaking in the tutorial, but as I said the devs will be on it, they seem real receptive.<br><br>Visually the game looks really pretty. I\u2019ve ran into some graphical glitches, but overall the game does a bang up job for an indie game on a budget. The soundtrack is also real good stuff too. Overall the game has a nice atmosphere, filled with color and beauty.<br><br>Now when it comes to narrative, Masquerada is real damn good, standing toe to toe with some of the recent RPG greats. The game creates an interesting world with fleshed out and likable characters. The game is also filled to the brim with codex entries that you find strewn throughout the game.  I read everyone that I could find and you know a game\u2019s narrative is good when you want to read all the text it gives you. Many of the codices are also used to flesh out the protagonist, Cicero, and his past.  The main cast all have depth and are likable. The characters are also really brought to life by the excellent voice acting brought by some of the industry\u2019s VA veterans such as Jennifer Hale, Liam O\u2019 Brien, Dave Fennoy, Matthew Mercer, Crispin Freeman, and more. Masquerada\u2019s narrative kept me engaged the whole way through. The ending is the right kind where they are some loose ends that can be taken up with a sequel, but pretty much the main narrative of the game has been resolved so it\u2019s not an unfulfilling sequel hook.<br><br>So in conclusion while there are some flaws that can be fixed, Masquerada is a damn fine game that deserves to stand shoulder to shoulder with recent indie RPGs like Shadowrun, Aurion, and LISA and Undertale. I definitely recommend any RPG fan to buy it, it's well worth it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25833221', 'summary' );

The game claims to be a RPG but there are very few elements to support that claim, especially given the fact that the story is quite linear and there are no choices for you to make, you\u2019re basically just watching how everything unfolds. That said, there is a lot to say about Masquerada, both good and bad, and I believe it\u2019s a game that went under a lot of people\u2019s radar and I truly believe it deserves a lot more exposure and credit than it has received.<br><br>One of the key elements that make this a truly wonderful experience is the fact that all the dialogue is fully voice acted, with the exception of dialogue between background characters. What I want to say is that the voice acting, as well as the entirety of the OST, are really top-notch, I can't stress that enough. The music is of epic proportions and among the best I\u2019ve heard this year in any videogame and, with that in mind, I\u2019d suggest to even those that are not interested in the game to give the OST a try. I find the stylized visuals to be well put together and fitting with the theme the game is aiming for, even though some of the textures are rather low detail. The visuals of the characters actually remind me of Abyss Odyssey in a way I can\u2019t really explain, but just so things are clear, that is a plus in my book. The animations themselves look really smooth but they seem a little off place in comparison to the 2d background, and that took me a while to get used to.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u>Story<\/u><\/div><br>The game takes place in Ombre, a country widely known for its exotiqueness and magic. On the other hand, what really distinguishes it from the rest of the world is the use of masquerines, which grant its wearers control of the elements. Given the scarceness of these masks, Ombre\u2019s society was divided into several factions, guilds and whatnot, and this is pretty much what shapes the entire storyline. That said, at first I felt like the game didn\u2019t really do a good job in explaining what was going on and who you are but, slowly, everything started to make sense (reading the codex entries helps a lot). The tutorial, which teaches you the basics of combat, also serves as a prologue to the events of the rest of the game, which takes place 5 years after. I feel like even slightly resuming the initial part of the plot could potentially spoil some people so I\u2019ll refrain myself from doing so. All you need to know is that this game pretty much has it all, from an enduring political conflict in a society characterized by huge disparities in terms of social and political structure to ever enduring friendships, betrayal, loss of loved ones, intrigue, mystery and the discovery of the secrets behind an old civilization. Not only the world but each individual main character is very unique and interesting in their own way, offering a different vision of the world that surrounds them. The game does have some jokes here and there, the overall theme of the game is rather grim and dark, but it does have its cheerful moments.<br><br>There is a lot to be said about the game story and its world building, and I do really mean A LOT. There\u2019s tons of codex entries that you can collect and read, which provide an insightful look to Masquerada\u2019s world, its locations, history, characters, culture and factions. The writing is exceptionally well done, and reading these is a joy and it certainly helps in getting you more immersed into the world and understanding everything that is going on in greater detail. When reading these, I often found myself lost in thought wondering about this place, imagining how the places it described really looked, how I\u2019d fit in, what I\u2019d do in order to change it for the better and so on. I really found it very hard to not lose track of time when playing Masquerada. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u>Gameplay:<\/u><\/div><br>The worst thing in Masquerada for me, or the least good part of it, depending on how you see it, is the actual gameplay. While playing the game you\u2019ll either be in combat or walking around these closed areas trying to get from one point to another. In the latter, you can find codex entries, upgrades for your characters but also other people talking to each other about their everyday life or about more important events. These interactions are sadly not voice acted, while the main dialogue is, which is a shame given that the voice acting is actually really really good. <br><br>Combat is fought in real-time but you have the option to pause. While in other games pausing would give you an advantage, in the sense that you could plan your approach and use your abilities in the best way possible, I didn\u2019t find the need to do so in Masquerada, for I found the combat to be rather shallow and basically a spam fest. I must say the combat really disappointed me because, initially, it looked liked it had a lot of depth to it, with different possible combos with the various elements and other mechanics such as different stances that change how fast you can use your abilities and how much damage you deal\/take. It\u2019s also worth saying that the abilities that you have will be unlocked with points that you\u2019ll get as you play through the game so there is some room for you choose what you think it\u2019s best. Then there\u2019s also your masquerine ultimate ability, which varies depending on the masquerine you have equipped at any given time.<br><br>One particular mechanic which I found to be really neat is the ability to set your companions behaviour, in the sense that you can tell them what skill should they use and on who. For example, you can make it so that they target the enemy with the lowest amount\/highest amount of HP. Still, if you want, you can completely disable this entirely.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b><u>Overall thoughts:<\/u><\/b><\/div><br>What the game offers in terms of story, world design and visuals, compensates the lack of depth of the combat system and overall gameplay, which really hurts how I overall feel about the game. Masquerada could pretty much just be an adventure game stripped of all the combat and it still would be just as good. That said, I do appreciate the fact that it was rather easy, for it allowed me to progress faster through the story without having to worry with my opponents. Still, just when I was starting to feel that the game was extending itself, it just suddenly got even more interesting and hooked me even more.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>If you\u2019re looking for a superb story with a unique range of characters, each with their own ideals and visions, and an interesting, intriguing and believable world then Masquerada might be just the right game for you. If, however, you\u2019re looking for a challenging experience or something that offers a lot of depth in terms of combat, or pretty much any other form of gameplay mechanic to keep you hooked for that matter, you might find yourself rather disappointed.<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26544295', 'summary' );

The game is extremely colorful and quite pretty. <br><br>The only negative i can find is that the game has checkpoints and sometimes it's not after every battle but after two battles or three. Which wasn't really a problem except from the first area (library) since after figuring out how combat worked i didn't die that much. <br><br>If you like isometric rpg's you should play this game (and i would like a sequel so go buy it :P).

I had a blast with this game, loved the characters and the plot, and am really itching for more. <br><br>Would this have been even better if it was choice based? Yes. Does the linear gameplay negatively affect the game? No. <br><br>Are some bosses suddenly very difficult? Yes, but you know what? You change your tactics and suddenly its easy again. You cannot DPS every boss in this game, sometimes you need to switch to tanking or range tactics, which Cicero allows you to switch between very easily.<br><br>I had no trouble with the AI or tactics, but that may be because my approach is to let the AI do as they please and redirect their attention if I think they're needed else where or they're doing something stupid. Once I did that they usually followed through very well.<br><br>For the price I think this was a great game. If it had been $60 I would have been disappointed, but $25 is the same price as most books, and what this game does very well is tell a good story just look a good book would.<br><br>I would, and have been recommending this game to everyone.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26119852', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26119852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26119852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26119852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26119852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26119852', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26119852_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26119852_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25799751\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198083025098\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"122759370\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/77\/7719bef9d9db38bc0b9b1fdc0d1a38830325aa90.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/77\/7719bef9d9db38bc0b9b1fdc0d1a38830325aa90.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/77\/7719bef9d9db38bc0b9b1fdc0d1a38830325aa90_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198083025098\/\" data-miniprofile=\"122759370\">3.4528<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198083025098\/games\/?tab=all\">42 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198083025098\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198083025098\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI will recommend it, but this game has lots of the problems.<br><br>This is a detective story, set up in really interesting world. You can not compare it to BG, or any other CRPGs cause it's not. It is feels like narrative story, where the combat is just a complex QTE.<br><br>PROS<br>- The story of the world is fascinating. Rich with lore, factions, conflict.<br>- The characters are rich, but the game really struggles to explain it. However I loved the fact that everyone is somewhat &quot;grey&quot;. No pure good &amp; evil.<br>- The fabula is unique (at least for me). Brings the Vampire: The Masquerade fascination to the table.<br>- The story might be just engaging enough for you to continue.<br>- Estetics, music, atmosphere are really nice.<br><br>CONS<br>- The mechanics. It might be the prefference, but it does not force you to conserve your spells (they are a based on cooldowns). It's really hard to pull combos, which should be the shining jewel of the system. The combat is just too noisy for that.<br>- The story is very linear. No searching, no secrets, no reward for curiosity.<br>- The surroundings are bit rushed. Many of the areas are just boxes with texture, no context, couple of extra items.<br>- The controls do not feel responsive. The actions are not instantaneus, thus its really hard to tell whether you botched sequence or it's still pending. It might be related to the enemy hit boxes.<br>- The checkpoint system is abnoxious. No decent saves.<br>- Zero replay value.<br>- The prologue served really bad for the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25799751', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25799751' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25799751\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25799751' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25799751\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25799751', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25799751_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25799751_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25789615\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032186760\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"71921032\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032186760\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71921032\">p.l.hebert<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032186760\/games\/?tab=all\">74 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032186760\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032186760\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst 3 hours: interesting story line.  But more of a point and click game with occasional combat than an RPG. Certainly the levels are very linear - not an open-ended world but interesting so far nevertheless.  The art is pretty, voice-acting is well done as well.  In addition, the game feels polished.<br><br>On the downside, two irritating points so far.  First, the companions' AI just loves to cluster your companions together in the middle of area of effect damage.  This can be avoided, for sure, if you take over their behaviour but then combat becomes very  micro-managed.  Second, I sure wish there was a &quot;save&quot; game option, rather than autosaves at select story points.  Being forced now to play the same trio of (increasing difficulty) battles over, and over, and over again only to die towards the end of the third battle has ceased to be fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25789615', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25789615' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25789615\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25789615' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25789615\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25789615', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25789615_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25789615_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25805169\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lordyavuz\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51218185\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de948d74bd5e0b353fba2ba22a9d28bbdaa49b80.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de948d74bd5e0b353fba2ba22a9d28bbdaa49b80.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de948d74bd5e0b353fba2ba22a9d28bbdaa49b80_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lordyavuz\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51218185\">Lord General Yavuz<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lordyavuz\/games\/?tab=all\">625 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lordyavuz\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lordyavuz\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a proud backer of Masquerada: Songs and Shadows, I must say the game is what I was craving for for the last a few years, by the looks of three hours' gameplay.

Tough combatants and fluid interactions keep the pace quite exciting.

However, the story is linear and there are no sidequests. You also cannot return to rooms you've previously visited, so you have to make sure you've explored the whole place before going to the next one. If you're the type of RPG player who likes exploring the world, talking to NPCs, and doing sidequests, this is not for you. However, there are optional dialogues with some of the main characters.<br><br>If you don't like reading, this may not be the game for you. But I liked how very deep and well thought out the lore is, and the codex is massive! If you don't want to delve much into the storyline, then I guess you can ignore that. All dialogues between the characters have voiceovers, and one particular detail that I liked was how there's a 3D animated portait of the character as it speaks, with a banner in the color of their affiliation. Most of the game is in 2D art, but it's intricately designed and very detailed, especially the comics-style cutscenes. The soundtrack is also beautiful.<br><br>The combat is a bit complicated to master, but it helps that you can reset your skill tree and practice at the training grounds. You can try different ability combos among your party members and once you've found the best strategy that works for you, the battles are a bit easier to finish. However, I didn't care much about the stances and it didn't present any issues for me in the game.<br><br>There are still a few bugs in terms of achievements that the developers are already addressing (they respond promptly in the forums).

But, if you're looking for gameplay and combat, look somewhere else.  I'm not going to lie I wanted to like the combat but... it's pretty bad.  I honestly wish the combat was completely turn based with no team AI.  After restarting at the same checkpoint 4 times and repeating the same fights over and over only to get a little farther each time I simply turned the difficulty to 'Story Mode'.  It was well worth it to just forget the frustration of the combat system and dive deep into the rich story and wonderful characters.  The art is amazing, and of course top notch voice acting, the music is also WONDERFUL.  The prologue I didn't understand the reason for and wish they just incorporated the tutorial into the game, it was unecessary.  There were a few puzzles I enjoyed but that could be simply because it was different than just running from point A to point B while gathering collectable in between.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30845857', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30845857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30845857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30845857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30845857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30845857', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30845857_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30845857_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30677402\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040704243\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"80438515\">pur3adrenaline<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 29.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter playing this game I can't wait for another set in the world of Masqueraa.

It's been a while since I've throughoutly enjoyed such a story driven RPG (albeit linear); I've never felt like it was a chore to get through due to its well directed pacing and characters. I had no issues with the battle system; honestly, I think it's more simplified and quicker compared to Baldur's Gate and PoE.<br><br>I don't think the demo does the game justice though; when I played it, I was pretty lukewarm to what was presented. But when playing the scene in the actual game itself, you have a much better context and interest on what's going on. So with that said: if you're in the market for a rich storyline, lore, and characters, give Masquerada a try.

The game provides a battle system and character customization system that are deep enough to provide replayability and require strategic decision making, while not being overwhelming like other games in the genre. In addition to that, the game allows you to reset your skill points halfway through the game and rebuild your characters, which I found helped a great deal. The story is engaging and even surprising at times, and the passion of the creative team is evident throughout. The voice acting is overall very, very good. The art is gorgeous, and the soundtrack is well-suited to a game that takes place in a world with culture and magic built on the ideas of art and music. The battle system is real-time but pausable and has several levels of strategy that the player must take advantage of be successful, but again without being overwhelming. The length is good (~15 hours).<br><br>There are a few cons for the game, of course. First and foremost, there is absolutely no &quot;exploration&quot;. The game is extremely linear and always tells you the direction to go to the next cutscene and\/or battle. It is reminiscent of a game like Final Fantasy 13 in this way, where you are always just following hallways to the next event. At first this was not a big deal but gets repetitive as the game moves forward. The lore of the world is built through journal entries by the protagonist, so there's a ton of expositional reading if you want to truly understand what's going on. The storytelling does break the rule of &quot;show and don't tell&quot; all the time, and by the end I simply stopped bothering. The dialogue is written in such a way as to require this exposition in order for the player to grasp what's going on, and you can't always get everything out of a conversation from the context. Finally, there are elements of the character interaction that pull me out of the story (the two main male characters become best friends within a few hours of meeting each other, for instance). <br><br>Those issues aside, it's a wonderful experience and worth the time for anyone who wants to play through an engaging and surprising story with beautiful music and art, deep character customization, and an interesting (if someone repetitive) battle system.

Witching Hour studios' hard work shines through in the beautiful graphics and the lore crafted in this rich world of culture and politics, with characters that leap off the screen in polished voice-acting (one whom is LGBT+), and wonderfully composed music. For those who want a gripping story set in a fantasy world of songs and shadows, I would highly recommend this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29532393', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29532393' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29532393\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29532393' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29532393\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29532393', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29532393_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29532393_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29408736\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013328690\/recommended\/459090\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"53062962\">rasabt<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 11.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing into Masquerada i didn't expect much and got quite a surprise.<br>Thinking this is some sort of Baldurs Gate\/ Pillars of Eternity-clone is kinda wrong:<br>yes combat mechanics are similiar (in a good way), but Masquerade is first and foremost a story told.<br><br>The focus of the game is fully on the characters and the tale the game tells. There's still some minor char-development in the form of small skill-tress and a handfull of &quot;gear&quot;-choices (inks, masks, etc.) but none of this is in anyway even close to what old IE games or the fantastic new Obsidian games (Pillars, Tyranny) offer.<br>Combat works just like you would expect: realtime with the option to pause and issue commands for your up to three-man(woman) team...yet again it's all very toned down from classical rpgs. <br>Which doesn't mean combat is bad; there are actualy some realy engaging mechanics and encounters to find here; positioning and interupting aswell as skill-synergies do play quite a role in higher difficulties and seeing everything work together is quite a joy. It's just nowhere near as complex as BG\/IWD or Pillars\/Tyranny.<br><br>What realy shines is the story. There's so much dialogue, character interactions, lore and plot to be found that it sometimes even outshines older classics; all set in an quite interesting &quot;fresh&quot; feeling scenario.<br>What begins as a mere criminial-investigation turns into so much more; you see characters grow, change and develope. A lot of the content is definitly focused on more mature players (which is a good thing) and rarely feels forced (which is a quite a feat seeing as how some rather &quot;spicy&quot; topics are touched upon). <br><br>The amazing(!) soundtrack, great voice-acting and beautiful art-style do the rest and make this one the most enjoyable story-driven-games i played in along time. Missing an open world, side-quests and gear-hunting is not a negative in this inctance since the the flow of the story is never broken, never a moment where you feel you missed some bland-side quest before you can progress the main-plot. <br><br>I realy do hope they expand on this IP, especialy now that the base-lore has been laid out. <br>I can fully recommend this game to anyone (not just rpg-fans) who likes to enjoy a rather deep story-ride.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29408736', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29408736' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29408736\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29408736' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29408736\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29408736', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29408736_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29408736_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/459090\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 132 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30399983","25855332","25833221","25827585","26544295","26103486","26119852","25799751","25789615","25805169"]}
