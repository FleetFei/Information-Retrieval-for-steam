It is currently in the Steam Early Access program and is being developed and published by Betelgeuse Zero. They are an Ontario, Canada based digital design, marketing and game development company led by the highly talented Denys Shyshkin. This is the company's first game on Steam and second.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Presentation<\/div><br>In Orange Moon the player explores an alien planet. The selling point of the presentation is the unique visual style. However, I found the world to be a little bland with a minimal color palette being used. Despite this feeling, however, the graphics do a fair job of highlighting the gameplay. Therefore, blandness aside, this is the strength of the presentation.<br><br>Unfortunately, the sound engineering is poor. The soundtrack and in game sounds are average at best. They do not help immerse the player into the game as they should. The style choices are currently poor. I believe that the dev needs to take a closer look at how the better games in the genre handle their sound and take some inspiration. Doing so would do wonders for the game.<br><br>Currently the only settings that you can change are sound and music both of which have bars and an on\/off switch. There is also an option to play in or out of full screen mode.<br><br>Unfortunately, I found that the game tends to slow my computer to a crawl when I alt-tab out of the game to take notes. I am unsure as to why this is happening as it doesn't happen with other games. The game takes only a relatively small amount of memory and CPU usage. Consequently, whenever I wanted to take notes to write this feature I would close it and restart it. This is more than a little aggravating. As with other games in Early Access the game has other glitches and game crashing bugs. However, given the desire of the developer to release a good product these will be eradicated.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br>The game is presently played with keyboard and mouse. There is no controller option. A clever little on screen tutorial has been provided.<br><br>I have found checkpoints to be a blessing. While the overall game is not overly difficult there are places in the game that are ridiculously easier or more difficult than areas preceding this. These are true of boss fights and the like but are also present in normal platforming stretches. This is frustrating.<br><br>The game has a nice upgrade system. The first upgrade I made was to a machine gun. There are more weapons, better ammo and larger caps, jets and augmentations that become available. This is a well implemented system that gives a good feeling of reward whenever you level up. However, there appears to be a lot of upgrade options for a game that is ten levels long. <br><br>The puzzle and secrets are the highlight of the game. I'm not someone who generally hunts them out. Therefore, I feel that the game design in this area is very good. Some are easy to find, as hoped, but others are a challenge. The puzzles themselves are also solidly designed and none of them feel unfair.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Price Point<\/div><br>I don't usually make a specific mention of the price point of a game. However, I do feel that $14.99 for a game of this quality and type is outpricing itself. There are other games within the same genre that are of critical acclaim that dare not charge this price. Consequently, I am skeptical that the game will sell as hoped. While this does leave room for the occasional sale, a price point where I'd happily purchase copies for friends, I am left to ponder how much non-sale periods will be hurt.<br><br>Edit: The dev has advised me that he has put in a price request change to $9.99. This completely eliminates any concern that I have for the pricing of the game. This is a very good price. My initial suggestion was to sale price it at this point but as he was unable to do so (there has to be an eight week gap between sales on Steam and he had a launch discount) he went ahead and made the price request. Good on you dev. Thank you.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div><br>I feel that I have been overly critical of the game in this review. I've diagnosed a lot of faults with it. Although I stand by those criticisms the game does deserve its share of praise. The game has strong RPG elements following up from a strong tutorial. I really do like the upgrade system despite querying its potential to be  excessive. The platforming is fun aside from the parts that are ridiculously difficult given their context to the game. The puzzle and secrets are the highlights that I really have enjoyed discovering. The game has potential to be very good if the presentation levels can be increased and the difficulty throughout parts of the game reconsidered. I only recommend purchasing now if you are willing provide feedback for future updates.<br><br>Steam note: This is a game worthy of an in between yes and no vote. However, as Steam doesn't allow you to vote that way and there are strong positives to the game it gets a thumbs up.<br><br>For similar reviews and our popular giveaways (including hardware giveaways) please consider visiting <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Steamified<\/a>.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24435743', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24435743' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24435743\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24435743' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24435743\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24435743', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24435743_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24435743_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/432950\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28368306\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"5978460\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/\" data-miniprofile=\"5978460\">Chris<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/games\/?tab=all\">1,712 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/\">88 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/432950\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Orange Moon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Orange Moon for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm drawn to certain games, without a doubt I'm drawn to the visuals of certain games. Orange Moon is proof of my Magpie like tendency to be drawn to something that looks interesting, and interesting Orange Moon is.<br><br>At first I thought it was going to be a Metroidvania type affair, however after ten minutes of playing through the first level I started to realise that no, this isn't an attempt to recapture something that so many have tried to recapture before. No, Orange Moon attempts to be its own thing - a Sci-Fi Platformer. Sure, it has a few RPG elements in the way of resources and power ups, but the level design and progress is very much 'left to right' in the true platforming sense. There's no back tracking, hidden passages and ability checks that I've come across so far.  Normally I'd have passed on looking at a platformer, as I feel like I've played as many as I can play and enjoy, but the Sci-Fi design of Orange Moon drew me in.<br><br>Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised at how visually appealing Orange Moon is. Developer Betelgeuse Zero originally started doing UI and Character design for other developers, and this is where Orange Moon stands out. Everything looks the part. There's a clear design effort here to build an overall experience that all ties together. The UI and Character design all present a clear vision of a Sci-Fi world, of a murky mining experience gone wrong. I admire this, as it's a part of my own design process I really struggle to come to terms with.<br><br>In fact, the more I think about and the more I play its clear that Orange Moon's design overall is very polished. Its opening level has a good pace to it, it\u2019s almost text book in design in the way it introduces hazards and the methods the game gives you to overcome them. I like it. It's simple and effective, and more importantly it's not annoying. The game gives you the info and moves on, it doesn't keep spamming the tutorial at you, so it never feels like the game slows down.<br>Orange Moon has a clear story design too, again it follows the simple but effective trend that is apparent throughout the game\u2019s design. The game drip feeds the story to you via the narrative incoming messages from a mysterious Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson explains tidbits of just what you\u2019re doing on this strange Moon, and how best to navigate it so you can survive. Simple, effective, to the point. Orange Moon never tries to over explain, or over complicate matters, it\u2019s very happy to leave the player to play allowing the experience tell the story. It\u2019s a skill I haven\u2019t seen too much in indie games \u2013 the comfortable silence. The confidence in knowing that your gameplay will carry the story, your level design will show the player the world and you\u2019ve done a good enough job of keep the player engaged with the entire package of the game.<br><br>However, for as strong as the design and thought process into the game appears the actual gameplay seems a few steps behind now. The main issue I had while playing was the unnatural feel and unresponsiveness I had with the controls. The game supports an Xbox 360 controller, which is always a nice addition to have, yet it doesn't feel totally calibrated. The left and right sticks fail to take advantage of the analogue inputs, with directional shooting seemingly stuck to an 8-point digital control setting. You can shoot 45 degrees up, or 45 degrees down, or straight ahead. I was unable to shoot anyway in between, which considering the game encourages you to use your gun to solve puzzles and defeat enemies as you progress led to a frustrating affair. This becomes an increasing problem during the platform section of the game, where you're required to jump hazards or navigate large gaps. The control and finesse isn\u2019t there that you\u2019d expect from using an analogue stick. I\u2019d be more forgiven if the controls were mapped to the d-pad, as at least then you\u2019d know what to expect. <br><br>As far as 'Early Access' goes Orange Moon is doing it well, it feels like a potential ready to release game searching for user feedback to make sure it's fully ready. I'd even dare say that there are full release games out there that aren't as polished as Orange Moon's current build. If Betelgeuse Zero can nail down the controller support, so there's a more natural and responsive feel then they'll be on to a winner. It's a game I'll return to play again once it has its full release. It\u2019s one of the real true \u2018it has promise\u2019 games on Early Access, and if Betelgeuse Zero can work on the control aspect of the game, it\u2019s one that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll enjoy.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28368306', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28368306' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28368306\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28368306' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28368306\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28368306', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28368306_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28368306_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/recommended\/432950\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26251115\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"59860123\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04f70d1eef58157be4db72ff7e876f9f945cacab.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04f70d1eef58157be4db72ff7e876f9f945cacab.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04f70d1eef58157be4db72ff7e876f9f945cacab_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/\" data-miniprofile=\"59860123\">Desolater IV<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/games\/?tab=all\">5,500 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/recommended\/\">653 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/desolater_iv\/recommended\/432950\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Orange Moon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">A 2D Sci-Fi Action Platformer<\/div><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/oFhsuGU1uQo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/oFhsuGU1uQo<\/a><br>+ The gameplay is enjoyable which focuses a lot on exploring and surviving. You are a prospector who is sent out to an alien moon in search of resources. It's your job to place beacons at resource veins while also collecting alien material from creatures you kill. <br>+ Visually the game looks great with very dark and desolate alien-like environments. It really does feel like you are exploring an alien world.<br>+ The thruster pack allows for some great verticality to the levels and can be used to get to very high hidden areas.<br>+ Resources are very limited, so you constantly have to keep an eye out for healthpacks, ammo, and grenades.

It is a combination of a platformer, adventure, role-playing game that takes place on an alien planet, lifeforms both animate and inanimate, remnants, secret areas and a constant need for jetpack fuel. When you look at the trailers for this game as well as the screenshots you may think this might be a knock off of a Metroid game or even something similar to <i>Jetpack Refueled<\/i> made by Rare back in the day. However, what you see on the outside is far from the truth of what is actually on the inside. <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics &amp; mechanics)<\/div>     <b>Features<\/b><br>     There are three main features in early access I want to point out currently. Those are: healing stations, secret areas and environmental hazards.<br><b>Healing Stations<\/b><br>     During the start of the second level, you are finally introduced to these resource areas that have some remains of an emerald rock burrowed beneath the underground. These areas will give you more jetpack fuel or health when you hoist up an energy post per each area you see. This is very self-explanatory as time goes on.<br><b>Secret Areas<\/b><br>     Each level has certain secret areas spread throughout the level in which you find remnants, extra jetpack fuel, more health and possibly sometimes upgrades. This is pretty self-explanatory, like with most games in this genre you will spend most of your time backtracking depending on what side of the map on the level you want to head down first. <br><br><b>The Moon Rose<\/b><br>Moon Roses are placed at different areas and across different pathways in the game. You use a flamethrower when near one to burn the remains of the plant. If you stand by them, they will deliver a stream of health where you can recover any health you have lost. Usually energy canisters and more jetpack fuel are found by them.<br><br><b>The Controls<\/b><br>     Currently in early access there is no controller support. This is my largest problem with this game because this game severely needs controller support. When using a mouse, the controls feel very clunky, unsuitable and makes for a very rough gaming experience. It controls more like Jetpack Refueled with clunky keyboard controls. For example, during many situations, you have to dash fully over to the left and right while at the same time avoiding annoying environmental hazards, the most common being poison and pitfalls. However, it is very hard to control accurately the precise movement to the left and right on a good keyboard.<br><br>      I know that the developer has stated that adding controller support is a priority for them as it should be since it seems like it controls quite similar to <i>Jetpack Refueled<\/i> and <i>Shadow Complex<\/i>. The controller should allow for smooth, fluid movements that you have to slightly touch for it to fully respond. <br><b>Graphics<\/b><br>     While the graphics are not bad, the background colors are dull, primary colors in my own opinion. It would really help if they added a nice polish with more bright colors to give the game more life to it. The background atmosphere I do understand needs to have a good blend of colors contrasting the light and dark with a balance that illuminates and complements one another. Right now, both do not complement one another but stand in opposition. The panning of the environment you go through is very well lit, however, the background of the scenery could use some sprucing up before the full release of the game. <i>Shadow Complex<\/i>, <i>Metroid<\/i> and <i>Jetpack Refueled<\/i> stand as primary examples within this genre.<br>      One main difference this game has when it comes to comparison of more action packed games such as <i>Shadow Complex<\/i>, <i>Metroid<\/i> and <i>Jetpack Refueled<\/i> is that there are usually tons of human enemies on the screen all at one time in these compared to <i>Orange Moon<\/i>  and takes carefully planned tactics and strategy. This game is more about lifeforms on a different planet, primarily different areas within habitable life.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Good &amp; Bad: Positive &amp; Negative Aspects of Orange Moon in its Current State<\/div><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Positives<\/div><br>\u2022\tExcellent and well executed concept to mix action with role-playing and metrovania<br>\u2022\tA well immersive soundtrack that is comparable to great scores like Resident Evil, more gloomy and somber<br>\u2022\tGreat support from the developers that answer any questions, implementations, suggestions, bugs and problems<br>\u2022\tA dedicated team that seeks out to make this game into something memorable and fantastic<br>\u2022\tA well-defined difficulty that is not merciless but difficult enough to have you scratching your head at times<br>\u2022\tIncredible puzzles that give you no walkthrough nor does it hold your hand. You have to figure these out for yourself<br>\u2022\tA good price point compared to other games in its genre, $14.99 U.S. dollars<br>\u2022\tInspiration behind great classics such as <i>Metroid<\/i>, <i>Megaman<\/i>, <i>Jetpack Refueled<\/i> and <i>Shadow Complex <\/i> plus more<br>\u2022\tRoom for growth and improvements along the way that will turn out to make the game absolutely great<br>\u2022\tDiscovery and exploration<br>\u2022\tHidden areas and secrets<br>\u2022\tExcellent boss fights<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Negatives<\/div>\u2022Color palette, levels could be a little more open than being confined to separate sections you have to constantly backtrack through to make sure you never missed any<br><br>\u2022Needs to add a variety of difficulties to play in the game; some easier and some harder<br><br>\u2022Menu needs to be more intuitive and it would be awesome if they could have a side map with different markers to indicate the location you are going toward as well as using directions such as North, South, East, West, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast and Southeast to indicate the direction you are currently headed<br><br>\u2022Enhanced text for the story. Currently the story is told through short captions, however, it is hard to read before moving on to the next area. They need to have the ability in which you can scroll through any parts you have missed in the story through the menu to be able to check in the form of notes<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall 7\/10<\/div>    Since this is early access there is of course going to be a large variety of bugs and glitches at the start of the game's development. For example, I came across some areas where the character you play as freezes, glitches out at certain checkpoints. This is frustrating right now for early access in the time being since majority of the time you have to completely exit out and restart from the last checkpoint you left off at. I also want to mention that Warwick over at Steamified found that there is a bug where it seems to drag his computer when he wants to alt+tab to minimize the game so he can take important notes even though his processor and graphic processing unit is at acceptable levels.<br><br>     I have large hopes that this game will succeed when it is fully released on PC. I can see a whole community of people supporting and backing this game. It takes what is a rather simple concept and adds a good blend of strategy and platforming to it. It is intriguing, contemplative and relaxing to play. That is all I can hope for in this moment and time for a game like this. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Key<\/div>4-5 = ok<br>6-7 = good<br>8-10 = amazing<br><br>     I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.

Orange Moon is, at the moment, a good survival action platformer, with exploration and some rpg elements such as upgrades for either weapons, health, fuel or jets. Your mission is to find resources for the mining operation that sent you there with your starting gear, that consist of a basic machine gun and the flamethrower. While it does sound dull, the game was difficult enough to make it interesting. However that difficulty come mainly from the tight controls, rather than precision or faster\/tougher opponents. Besides basic movement you have your jets that allow you to re-jump while in the air by consuming fuel, the same jets allow you to dash, giving you space vs charging enemies or avoiding acid pits. Additionally you have your weaponry and a grenade launcher, that both fire is fixed angles. Since you can't aim lower or higher you need to jump and time your shots vs some enemies and account for the trajectory of the grenade to take armored targets. Now this may sound boring, old and troublesome but it adds up to the challenge this title provides. Besides the harsh environment that almost anything can damage you the are also 3 types of enemies, biological, armored and indestructible. In the later type are some wall spikes that behave like proximity traps and must be avoided. There are various biological lifeforms, all hostile and some even with weak spots! Similarly on the armored type, while the majority are stationary cannons, shooting at you, all the minibosses and the boss I've encountered were mechanical, the minibosses and the boss even had critical spots! As a platformer the game promotes you to explore and burn your fuel reserves looking for secrets at some weird places, these secrets were mostly point boosts and usually an upgrade token. Points can be used in game to purchase either ammo for your various weapons on even more upgrade tokens! With these tokens you can upgrade your gear, which consist of your weapon, ammo, armor (health and the ability to carry some heavy guns later) your jet power and your fuel reserves. At the moment the game has 6 weapons and I had the chance to unlock 2 of them, thus use a total of 4 and each weapon has it's pros and cons, E.G.: the cannon was good vs armored and the flamethrower and the shotgun was good vs organics. Each weapon has its own unique upgrades and similarly the ammo types have additional upgrades each. What I enjoyed at this upgrade system is that besides making your gear better, you can actually see parts being added on it! Most noticeable was the second machine gun barrel, which gave it the ability to fire 2 shots at once. Sadly, while there are upgrades available to every weapon, only the tooltips for machine gun work, so I do not know what E.G.: the shotguns upgrades do. The bonuses can vary from extra damage to bullet speed and penetration. Basic bullets final upgrade cause then to fracture and deal damage to the area behind the target! Additionally there are few puzzles in the game, nothing fancy, but it makes you feel that there is some story behind the mindless clearing of each level, that can be unfold, hopefully on future updates.<br><br>Besides all these, what I enjoyed most is the survival aspect of the game. Health was a bit rare to find, and you can get damaged easily. In fact I spent quite some time respawning with 30 hp (I had 250 max) trying to move forward in the most perfect way I could, trying to save even 1 hit point so I could explore a little further! In addition to this, checkpoints do not replenish health and when you finish a level, you start the next one with the HP you had left!<br><br>On the negative list, there are some bugs I've encountered, such as invisible enemies or invisible quest items, that were fixed after restarting the game. Currently the game has only 4 levels and 1 boss, thus I find it to be short lengthwise. Also the boss needs some work to its behavior as an encounter, like some random dash that you must avoid, because at the moment it's predictable. The way you defeat it, is boring as well. Spamming grenades, takes the fun and the special feeling of actually using the grenade. Instead of adding environmental objects that provide you with said grenades, at least, it could have a weakspot that upon hit, it drops a grenade pick up, suddenly making it a bit more interesting and interactive! Finally the lack of upgrade options tootip make, all but the first two weapons, an enigma to use. While you certainly improve the weapon you have no idea which aspect became better.<br><br>These being said, Orange Moon is perhaps the most promising title I've enjoyed the last year. I believe the development team will deliver a great game since the basis is solid and can offer the player enjoyment as well some intense moments!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I recieved this game from the steamified group.<br>For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.steamified.com<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24774392', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24774392' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24774392\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24774392' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24774392\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24774392', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24774392_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24774392_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29415553\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arsdementis\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"24533532\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78a88974c14af16df8f0a3e8d6c6019428971df3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78a88974c14af16df8f0a3e8d6c6019428971df3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78a88974c14af16df8f0a3e8d6c6019428971df3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arsdementis\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24533532\">Loa\\\\ Nodens<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arsdementis\/games\/?tab=all\">1,527 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arsdementis\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arsdementis\/recommended\/432950\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Orange Moon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Orange Moon for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOrange Moon is a game that blends a lot of different game elements. Action adventure, puzzle-platformer, RPG, medroidvania.<br>It looks and feels very solid even while in Early Access. I have encountered no bugs while giving it a spin, othen than a translation issue on the initial text displayed when selecting New Game. It is in a great playable state and its story sounds very interesting.<br><br><br>Gameplay:<br>You play as an astronaut hired, and equipped, by a corporation to explore and loot a planet off its resources. Apparently you are not alone on the planet and the corp representative wishes you do not die until you make their investment on you worth it! :P<br>The game plays like a puzzle platformer (Trine comes to mind) with basic keyboard controls and mouse for aiming. Gamepads are also supported. The protagonist has an assortment of weapons at his arsenal and a few gadjets as well. All upgradeable in RPG-like fashion.<br>The environment is harsh, filled with hazards, and there's also an AI lifeform that you have to deal with, as you make your way around the map. Of course there are secret locations to discover, typical of puzzle platformers, and checkpoints to save your progress in the level.<br>One thing that I would like implemented in this game is a way to go back to your last checkpoint if you choose to restart the level. Something I did accidentaly by misclicking, losing my entire progress with the level. :(<br>Although when I restarted the game and hit continue, I noticed it did load the last checkpoint.<br><br>Graphics:<br>Graphics look very well done, extremely detailed. The level environment seems alien and bizarre.<br>Notice there are no graphics quality options or even a resolution selector. Just a fullscreen toggle.<br><br><br>Music\/Sound Design:<br>I did not encounter music in the levels themselves, unless I did not get far enough for it to trigger (as in there could be scripted musical trigers at some point). There's dark ambient sound design on the menu and music playing when you start the game. Both are very well done.<br>The sound effects are also very beatiful and feel quite in place.<br><br><br>Pros:<br>-Great levels and atmosphere in general.<br>-Environmental hazards.<br>-RPG-like upgrades.<br>-Story looks very interesting.<br>-Extremely polished, even more so considering its currently in Early Access.<br>-More weapons\/levels\/bosses will be implemented according to the steam store developer statement. This is great considering weapons\/upgrades already in the game are a lot!<br><br>Neutral:<br>-Still in Early Access. Some players do not like getting EA\/unfinished games, so there's your warning.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Needs option to load last checkpoint from the Esc menu.<br><br><br>Conclusion:<br>The game is extremely fun and polished. One of the most polished games I have ever seen in EA status. This, in my opinion, speaks tons of the developer capabilities, general outlook and commitment to their project. The game is great as it is, by the time it exits EA status it can only become even better!<br><br>Score:<br>Gameplay: \t\t9\/10<br>Graphics: \t\t9\/10<br>Music\/Sound:          9\/10<br>Concept\/Story:\t8\/10<br><br><br>More game reviews @ <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/cassus.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/cassus.org<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29415553', 'summary' );
