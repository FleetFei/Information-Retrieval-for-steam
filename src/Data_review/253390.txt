In Hot Tin Roof you presume the role of Emma Jones, a PI who's partner is the world's first Cat investigator, Franky (short for Franscine). A number of crimes have taken place in Hot Tin Roof and it's your job to figure out what's going on and who is behind the recent crimes. HTR is set in a place called Hot Tin Roof, a place full of cats, pidgeons, rats and of course humans and there are clear divides between the different types of animals which clearly play a role in the crimes that have taken place.<br><br>+Nice art style\/graphics<br>+Outstanding writing which leads to a lot of laugh out loud moments thanks to the game's humour<br>+From what I have played the plot seems very interesting<br>+Rather than unlocking skills you find new types of revolver ammo which give you new ways to interact with the world<br>+You can question different characters about clues you have found which often point you towards what you're looking for<br>+Good controller support in-game but the menu isn't very controller friendly<br>+Interesting puzzles which aren't too difficult to solve<br>+You save by visiting the bathroom which is quite an interesting idea and leads to some funny lines early on when Franky explains this mechanic<br>+Has a Cat that wears a Fedora, I mean c'mon that's cool right?<br><br>-At some points you do have to do quite a lot of grinding for the game's currency so you can afford to buy items which are required for progression<br>-Save locations are few and far between<br>-There is no map or any form of fast travel so you have to do a lot of walking back through areas you have already visited<br><br>Verdict:<br>7<br><br>A well written noir adventure game which falls flat slightly due the lack of a map and fast travel system.<br><br>El K.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14905552', 'summary' );

The Game starts of with Jones a Female Private Investigator and her cat Franky who is also a female. The game mentions 8 bit graphics and while it is 3D it does accomplish the feeling of those type of graphics brought into a modern time.<br><br>Here is a full review on my channel<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/PyiE7Ctqnyg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/PyiE7Ctqnyg<\/a><br><br>Pros:<br>- Graphics are great and throughout the levels I did not run into tearing or graphical glitches<br><br>-Sound track is amazing it really gives you an old timey feel when playing the game <br><br>- Fairly intuitive mechanics as it is easy to figure out how things work. Even if you get stuck and don't know how use something Franky will be sure to tell you what to do, how to use it, or what to get. <br><br>- A story that keeps you constantly involved. The story does not get boring as you are never really doing one thing at a time. You constantly figuring out to get to one area, what clues to use on a civilian, or what case to focus on. <br><br>-Clues are found easily but if having trouble you can always ask your chief or save money for a clue to be bought. <br><br>-6-8 hours gameplay<br><br>-Fairly comedic<br><br>-Very Bug free<br><br>Cons:<br>- Some aspects of bullets are not explained well for example Knockback bullets can be use to propel yourself it took me 30 minutes to figure that out. <br><br>-Grinding for money can become a problem when you need to buy a big purchase<br><br>Overall the game is a lot of fun I have been recording\/playing it before it was released and have almost completed the game. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle crime games. I am constantly using my brain to think how to get past certain situations to progress the game. Franky and Jones are on the job and there will be no one who can hide from them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14561706', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14561706' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14561706\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14561706' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14561706\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14561706', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14561706_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14561706_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18138514\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/squidwalk\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"12944886\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/99\/99136f55f707a2cc79c0290e5cfc6a73d5b245e0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/99\/99136f55f707a2cc79c0290e5cfc6a73d5b245e0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/99\/99136f55f707a2cc79c0290e5cfc6a73d5b245e0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/squidwalk\/\" data-miniprofile=\"12944886\">squidwalk<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/squidwalk\/games\/?tab=all\">451 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/squidwalk\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/squidwalk\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 21, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is too charming to not recommend. It has a lot of major faults, it's clearly a freshman endeavor. But giving it a thumbs down would feel like criticizing a poem a loved one wrote for you. It's earnest and charming. You noticed it uses a slant rhyme, but you don't want to make the author feel bad about it. They did something nice.<br><br><u>The good points of the game:<\/u><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The high concept\/theme works well. The &quot;cube people&quot; concept is used just enough to be fun, but not overbearing. Sentient animals in a noir setting has precident in books like Gun, With Occasional Music. Hot Tin Roof does an excellent job making the idea its own, while still using the background metaphor of interspecies classism.<br><br><\/li><li>The soundtrack combines jazz with chiptunes. After listening to it for a while, I began to appreciate how difficult that must have been. It clearly required a bit to thought to put the two genres together in such a coherent way. Easy, early accessibility to a sound test NPC suggests the devs knew how well the soundtrack turned out.<br><br><\/li><li>The revolver tool felt extremely satisfying to use. It's is your main form of puzzle interface, and the animation\/SFX never stops being rewarding. Literally chambering the solution to a puzzle provided a sense of anticipation to your now-inevitable small victory. The inclusion of the self-propelling knockback bullets helped mitigate a lot of my gripes about having to re-tread areas do to unclear objectives. If there's one thing that makes retreads feel less bothersome, it's satisfying active movement acceleration.<br><br><\/li><li>Major characters don't get a lot of development time, but manage to feel colorful and noir-thematic without being too trope-dependant. The writing does a good job using tropes to circumvent the need for characterization without making characters feel flat. It subverts tropes in places where nior can seem mean or rough, making for a charmingly &quot;noir nice&quot; overall aesthetic. In particular, it portrayed the &quot;noir foreigner&quot; trope with humor and even-handedness.<\/li><\/ul><br><u>The okay:<\/u><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>Franky, the tag-along character, was a high point. Her writing is fun, noirish, and cute, and she doesn't get in the way of area interaction. I liked Franky. But the game allows you to shoot her, and she makes a sad meowing sound when you do. I really didn't want to shoot Franky. But the game requires a good amount of aimless exploration, and it provides you with a bullet type that propels you forward quickly when shot behind you. So I ended up shooting the heck out of Franky. I even got a shame-achievement for shooting her a lot called &quot;Franky Hater&quot;. I wish I couldn't shoot my friend by accident.<br><br><\/li><li>The writing is a mixed bag. Franky manages to be a funny sidekick without being annoying, which is a seldom accomplished feat. But Jones is a little too plain, and doesn't have a Detective Flaw. Most NPCs, particularly street-level ones you interact with for a single plot point, are surprisingly compelling. But NPCs that you don't interact with for plot seemed rather dry.<br><br><\/li><li>It was a fun idea to play as a female detective in a setting where visual sexualization is essentially impossible. But that necessitates more dialogue-based gender representation, and Jones' dialogue was usually a bit too straightforward to address her gender identity. This could easily have been a failing point though, with a &quot;too much to prove&quot; character, so it's not necessarily a bad thing.<br><br><\/li><li>Every puzzle area has a puzzle that makes good use of your combined abilities. But there are usually areas between these that merely require you to use your abilities to traverse them. This could function as conveyance. But the game's unclear objectives means you'll end up re-treading these areas frequently, and that transforms the teaching mini-puzzles into a chore.<br><br><\/li><li>The lack of flavor\/landmarks in the background of traversal areas means that it's easy to get lost in them, extending the chore of re-traversal as you walk around hoping you're going in the direction of your objective. Some sections have great background art, like posters for the cat-mayor done in both block-cat and realistic cat art types. They clearly had a capable art team. It'd would have helped navigation if more flavor was included.<\/li><\/ul><br><u>The bad:<\/u><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>There are almost always unclear objectives. The investigation process is obtuse, and entirely necessary. Players only vaguely know what they should be doing at any time. Sometimes the game helps by restricting player access to areas in purposeful ways. But expect to consult a message board or a Let's Play. I actually consulted a Let's Play, looked on message boards for help, and found the Let's Play-er on a message board looking for help.<br><br><\/li><li>Unintentional sequence breaks can really mess you up. Not understanding your objectives will lead to exploration, and exploration will lead to sequence breaks that you can't entirely recover from. I somehow missed a section where you question suspects in an interrogation room. Hours later the plot had moved on, and I was in a random cave, and I got a one-sided cut scene about questioning the suspects. It lead to a warp to the interrogation room, which I couldn't use because the suspects were already in jail at that point. I missed a clue that would help with the game's ending. I believe said ending got a work-around in a patch just to compensate for people missing clues due to unintentional sequence breaks.<\/li><\/ul><br>I'd recommend Hot Tin Roof to someone I know would like the themes, and would be able to work past the rough patches. But it's not polished, and it's not for everyone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18138514', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18138514' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18138514\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18138514' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18138514\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18138514', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18138514_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18138514_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16932359\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/solenoidpop\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"181073895\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94d4d0088cb841dae248e3113089d4f977ef2bbb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94d4d0088cb841dae248e3113089d4f977ef2bbb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94d4d0088cb841dae248e3113089d4f977ef2bbb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/solenoidpop\/\" data-miniprofile=\"181073895\">Lu Zhishen<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/solenoidpop\/games\/?tab=all\">173 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/solenoidpop\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/solenoidpop\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 7, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is terrific. I don't think I've ever played anything quite like this; I could repeat the (quite correct) observations others have made about the innovative combination of exploration platformer and point-click adventure game, but one comparison that kept (favorably!) coming to mind as I played was an old Sega Genesis game called Quackshot, of all things, primarily in terms of the exploration and the gradually-unlocked arsenal of trick bullets.<br><br>Hot Tin Roof is fun to *play*, in terms of the hopping and climbing and box-busting and puzzle solving, but what made me fall in love with this game within the first hour of play was the writing and the world-building. The game world has tons of atmosphere and charm, and the writing is top-notch; both the story and the dialogue (of which there is a ton, and it's all worth going through - you can't get stuck or punished for trying out a smartass reply) are as good as anything I've found in a game. The game is certainly cute, but that doesn't mean that the underlying mystery and themes aren't thoughtful.<br><br>I do hope Glass Bottom Games gives us another chance to play in the city of Tin Roof and environs; there are a lot of characters whose lives after the end of the game I'd love a chance to catch up with.

will reload all 4 bullets with your current bullet configuration instantly without having to manually remove and replace each one individually, though you will still have to frequently manually reload bullets to switch between types, the 4 earliest that you can get is ones that break objects like crates, one that reveals hidden levels\/platorms\/etc, one that is a grappling hook, and one that lights things on fire)<br><br>All in all, even if it's not very long I still find it well worth the asking price if you like either metroidvanias, CRPGs, or Noir games, while it's not a true metroidvania, it's got elements of &quot;you need to get this bullet type (which might as well just be a skill that you happen to use via your gun) to be able to solve this puzzle to get to this area to find a clue to get this search warrent, blah blah blah. And you may find things you couldn't before coming back to areas with new bullet types.<br><br>But be warned, if you don't like reading flavor text and prefer voice acting skiping over text, you will not get as much out of the game since it is all text which gives the game part of its fun, much like how a big part of CRPGs isn't the RPG part but the conversation trees part which is also very often text only without VO since there are a lot of tree options. And like CRPGs if you just do the main required dialog the game can be relitivly short but if you do all the dialog you can, it has a lot of good content there that takes more time.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14572555', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14572555' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14572555\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14572555' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14572555\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14572555', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14572555_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14572555_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21970925\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sutorei\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"88573969\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54754b94bc552f3403102def466359cf524368cc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54754b94bc552f3403102def466359cf524368cc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54754b94bc552f3403102def466359cf524368cc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sutorei\/\" data-miniprofile=\"88573969\">Sutorei<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sutorei\/games\/?tab=all\">166 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sutorei\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sutorei\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is all about the fusion of seemingly incompatible elements into something unique.<br> <br>What do you expect from a game, when the first thing you see are detectives in fedoras and trench coats, working inside a dimly lit police station with wooden furniture and red carpets everywhere? Maybe some gritty story about a rotten-to-the-core megalopolis, full of injustice and corruption, ruled by undefeatable criminal masterminds?<br> <br>However, it cannot be so grim, one would think, when the protagonist detective is a boxy woman, her partner is a boxy cat, and they jump and wobble as they move. Moreover, their whole world is like that too - boxy and jumpy. This visual style is lively and memorable, if limited, but one would think: can it convey something beyond a wacky-zany-surreal adventure?<br> <br>And then the heroes get an urgent request to investigate a recent burglary, and, shortly after, a homicide case. The plot only goes grimmer from there, holding faithfully to the noir canon. It does not get bleak and depressing, thanks to the carefully mixed light-hearted humor in the dialogues and interactions, that manages to ease the mood, without turning everything into an outright comedy. Also, the city and the characters you meet are not doomed to the worst: there's a big freedom of choice, and you can help citizens via side quests - almost all of your actions will be acknowledged in the game ending.<br> <br>The soundtrack helps game atmosphere greatly. When you play something noir, blues music with a juicy sax is necessary. In Hot Tin Roof that sax is accompanied by 8bit-ish synths - they fit in the ensemble as naturally as a xylophone or a rhodes piano would. The overall sound is chill and relaxing, and, with all the intricate sax solos, it stays in the background, as a good soundtrack should.<br> <br>That chillout mood is perfect for the gameplay - there's nobody to fight and kill, with aimlessly wandering green blobs in underground areas coming as close as this game gets to enemies. Your trusty Wobbly revolver is for overcoming obstacles and exploring the game world, which has its fair share of secrets. You collect new types of ammo as you advance in the game, and in a good Metroidvania fashion, you can always revisit previously locked out areas and use your new toys to find something desperately needed or just helpful and interesting.<br> <br>And remember - <b> you don't have to reload your revolver chamber by chamber, hold R to instantly reload your current configuration!<\/b> While this tip is present in the game, I wish it came by earlier.<br> <br>The game world is, again, a fusion of 2D and 3D. For the most part, you navigate it as a 2D platformer, but you can switch planes and make turns at some points. This actually simplifies the comprehension of the locations, as instead of sudden and not always explainable screen switches, you have obvious connections between streets, passages, and shafts. Another important tip: if you stand on the edge of the platform and can't see what's down there, most of the time there's nothing and you'll fall back to the ground level if you jump there.<br> <br>This experiment with mixing and fusing gameplay mechanics and styles results in a one-of-a-kind game, and it's well worth its price. As of today, Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora has roughly 7k owners according to Steamspy, and this rare gem deserves much more recognition.<br> <br>P.S.

noir and kitty-cats, what could be better, right?<br><br>I like it, it was charming with its graphics, atmosphere, and I enjoyed each individual character's personality.<br>The music was great, too!<br><br>One of the game's key features was a revolver that aquired special abilities for each type of bullet you collect: Blowing bubbles, lighting torches, using a grappling hook, and more. <br>It was a fun and unique trait for this game.<br><br>The initial premise is good, but, there are a couple of issues.<br><br>The game may seem long, and it does take awhile to beat, but the story itself is a lot shorter due to the complex puzzles.<br>So, if you do decide to buy it, I recommend taking your time exploring the game so you get as much out of it as possible.<br><br>The game is fairly frustrating at times and it's easy to get lost in the 'puzzle areas', though it's less infuriating as The Impossible Game, thankfully. <br><br>I had hoped that the story and the side quests would've been a bit longer. The noir genre relies on good story-telling and it just seemed to be lacking in this game, but I guess that's due to the strong emphasis on the platformer puzzles, so take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>Also, there are times when you can purchase items in the game. However, I found that it was very easy to mine for money early on, and once I bought most of everything that was available, money became useless.<br>It would've been really nifty if I had been able to bribe characters for clues or tips to progress a case or complete a side quest. <br><br>If there is a sequel for Hot Tin Roof (and I do hope there are plans for it because it was delightful!), I hope that Emma's cat partner, Franky, can do more than just act as a guide; I felt that at times she wasn't too helpful and she did get in the way when I fired the revolver, but she was good company. <br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the game and there is replayability value since there are various side quests to seek out and there are (from what I've read) around fifteen different endings. <br><br>If you like noir, cats, and puzzles that are more complex than what you'd find in Mario - I'd say it's worth a try!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15398644', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15398644' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15398644\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15398644' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15398644\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15398644', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15398644_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15398644_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>16 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14566305\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/biphenyl\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"32945802\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a1\/a1bee10ddb3474a65ad9824c13b5c72f99953fb9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a1\/a1bee10ddb3474a65ad9824c13b5c72f99953fb9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a1\/a1bee10ddb3474a65ad9824c13b5c72f99953fb9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/biphenyl\/\" data-miniprofile=\"32945802\">biphenyl<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/biphenyl\/games\/?tab=all\">339 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/biphenyl\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/biphenyl\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSort of an exploration Metroidvania noir with LucasArts adventure-style humor.

It has rough edges at times, no it is not perfect, but I've played so much stuff in the last 30 years that I love stuff that is DIFFERENT, and this is cool, different and fun. Some will tag it 'metroidvania' but really it is its own thing. Is adventure sleuthing a genre ? Now it is.<br><br>Longer version:<br><br>I pondered a while if I should click YES or NO at &quot;do you recommend this game&quot;.. As mentionned in the short version, the game does have rough edges, even outright bugs (being worked on, dev is really neat for that and so accessible both here and on twitter) but it has soul and it has style.. It is NOT a copy cat (heh) of anything, and I love it for that. It has a bit of a problem of meshing looking for clues\/advancing the story and the platforming puzzles.. My mind would be in one of the two mode but rarely engaged in both at the same time. Part of this is that level stretch for too long for nothing, and that the camera is too zoomed in to be able to easily map out the universe in my head without an in-game map.<br><br>Dev has stated that a 2D map isn't easily done (since levels curve around here and there) and that a 3D one is totally out of the question (ressource wise, and with the excellent point that this was attempted and failed by the big N in Metroid Prime). Maybe street signs or just crude drawings of maps on the walls in game would have helped.. or maybe some type of fudged teleport systems to get to the underground city of Remington or in and out of dump.. So navigation was annoying, but you do get used to it after a while, especially when you have all the gadgets. If you have a problem with spatial orientation, getting around and exploring nooks and cranies could be an issue.<br><br>Writing is fun and witty, even if the overall plot got a bit convoluted at times to me because chunks will arrive after long periods of platforming. Game could have done the classic adventure game 'characters on each side of the screen zoomed in' type of discussion maybe, at times it all felt tiny to read the speech bubbles, giving me the impression of chitchat even if important clues and infos were dropped.<br><br>I've played the whole thing with a controller, and the platforming works just fine. The clue interface is annoyjing at times and for that I'd reach for the mouse for a second to go quicker. Most reviews will explain the gun ammo\/reloading system and while it annoyed me for a while it wasn't that big of a deal in the end, but it'd be a lot better to clearly explain the quick reload option ! Thinking of other game with different ammo with the controller it could have been nice to skip the reload and switch ammo type with shoulder buttons, but the current system feel more thematic to the noir tone of course. On the puzzle side, having a fixed slot order could have helped in some spot where I wanted certain different type in a specific order. Nitpicking really.<br><br>More nitpicking: the clue interface and the options\/save\/quit panels should have been separate. Broke the immersion. Also list the timestamp on the save slot, since there's no indication if one is used at all or not..<br><br>Still reading ? Tiny warts and all this is still good fun, plus is has cats with ties and guns that shoot bubbles to reveal secrets. And rocket jumping. You could do a whole lot worse in your gaming choices! I had played the dev's Jones On Fire (Android) and will most definitely look forward to their eventual next project.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14720119', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14720119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14720119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14720119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14720119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14720119', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14720119_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14720119_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30948308\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272505681\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"312239953\">darthbob555<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is one of the best detective games I have ever played. It is thoughtfully laid out and every single detail is answered in the end, and that shows that real thought and effort has gone in. I do not intend to spoil the end but I am sure you will be satisfied with the end, because I know I am!<br><br>While the start can seem a bit slow, and eventually you may feel a bit of repetition going on, each of the characters have real personalities. Each character contributes in some way to the story, and the detective skills are very much required to look at the dialogue being spoken and to cross reference them with your notes. While it is not essential, and the game will help you out if you need to, this game has a lot of complexity to it, which allows you to get involved with the story and make your own investigations - this is something that I really like - you do not need to follow a set path and while the story is, inevitability, linear, the game does not say \u201cyou have to do this in this order\u201d.<br><br>The level design is very well made and I especially like the use of the contrast between simplistic tessellations of objects and their detailed textures. The levels make good use of 2D and 3D elements, such that the world appears 3D while the camera is fixed on a 2D plane.<br><br>The cat model for your detective friend is a nice addition, and even helps you out where necessary.<br><br>There is some plat-former type elements to the game which is further developed with the use of the gun ammo, which you pick-up along the course of the story. Though, I must admit, this can be very frustrating, especially when there are no save points around!<br><br>Another main part of this game\u2019s composition is puzzles; there are a couple different types such as finding hidden levers or trying to time your jumping and coordination skills to perfection. Each puzzle fits nicely into the theme and is another great addition to liven up the game.<br><br>Further more, I like the way that, when you go into a new area or a new layer of a building, the previous layer disappears and only the new one remains, which makes the game not only less resource intensive, but really resonates focus on the layer you are one and not the other layers\/background.<br><br>A really nice touch and to emphasize on the cleverness of this game, the title itself is actually a play on words for a phrase called \u201clike a cat on a hot tin roof\u201d, which really impressed me at how thoughtful the developers were!<br><br>If you intend to buy this game, I advise you to take one thing at a time and not solve all the little details at once, ever-wise, you can get overwhelmed and confused. (Remember to talk to your chief for clues if your stuck!) The story is complicated and may seem overwhelming at times but if you have read a few detective stories recently, then you should be in the mind set for a complex story. Some people have critiqued against the game for this but as Hercule Poirot once said, \u201cEvery murder has a simple solution behind its lies\u201d.<br><br>All in all, this is a great game and while not too long (my first complete run through took about 7 hours), it is really well polished and I hope for a sequel some time in the future.

This game has some heart and soul but mostly lacks in the later stages from pacing issues. It's a mixture of platformer and puzzle solving, with the diffculty curb being fair for the most part for some one who does not play either a lot. I think the game could have benfitted from a fast travel unlock about midway through to help speed up the game, and some of the later puzzles felt heavily padded. I feel like this game is the first in a series, that when I come back in ten years the sequal will eclipse it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30582604', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30582604' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30582604\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30582604' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30582604\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30582604', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30582604_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30582604_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30568241\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gledster\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"20738506\">Gledster<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 1.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm enjoying Hot Tin Roof so far, having purchased it as part of the Humble Freedom Bundle. I will confess the interface took some getting used to. Everything you pick up or hear about is considered a &quot;clue&quot;, even if it's not relevent to solving the current mystery in question. This can lead to some convoluted interface using to give something to someone. I can see what the developer was aiming for, something similar to Blackwell's &quot;notes&quot; system I think, but they've merged it with a traditional game &quot;inventory&quot; and it's a little confusing. <br><br>Other reviews have mentioned that the gun needs to be reloaded manually but they obviously didn't play far enough in to find the character\/contexual command that tells you to hold down the reload button and your character will do a full reload. This way you only need to access the reload menu to switch ammo types. <br><br>It has taken me a little while to get used to the 3D-grid system the game is using for its maps but again, once it clicks you can actually position places in your head in relation to other places and you're away. So when I was given a task I was able to work out &quot;I need to speak to this person at the end of the town&quot; and off I went as the map system had 'clicked' for me. <br><br>The characterisation is funny with some very amusing lines and references to other classic adventures including classics from the Lucasarts stable.<br><br>I'll happily keep playing this one right until the end.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30568241', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30568241' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30568241\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30568241' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30568241\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30568241', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30568241_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30568241_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30533507\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198027543392\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"67277664\">khalil<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 15\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA fun and goofy puzzle platform with a nice noir theme.

It has some solid play to it, but gets bogged down with some small issues, and one big Core issue. <br>Really there are only two things I couldn't overlook- The dialogue mechanics but not the writing, and telegraphing where to progress. <br>Entering into dialogue becomes a chore after the first time of talking to anyone because the only way of exiting dialogue is by finishing a conversation. Because it's a detective game, whenever I got new evidence, I would immediately try and question the related parties. But they almost never had anything new to add, so I would try to quickly get out but would often end up accidentally choosing the option that leads to a loop. This could be easily solved by adding a Westerado-esque 'walk away' option. But that's more of a personal issue, the next one is a fundemental flaw in design.<br>It is increadibly easy to sequence break this game. I would so often get to areas I didn't need to be yet, and have no idea what the significance to the current case was. As the 'Hardcore Gamer' review said &quot;<i>An entire murder took place and I had somehow collected the full set of clues for it and acquired an arrest warrant before I\u2019d ever even seen (or heard about) the murder for myself.<\/i>&quot;<br>Metroidvanias live for exploration, and Detective games live for deducing clues and what to do next. This mashes both in the same way you mash potatos. I didn't look for clues in the place I thought the criminal had motive to strike, I happened accross them as I blisteringly wandered around in a pyrotechnic haze. I managed to arrest every criminal except the last with out a warrent from the police chief, and when I finally did need a warrent he asked me &quot;Which case?&quot; and I was stupified. I had never even realized I <i>had<\/i> other cases (all of which I had solved, and without a warrent)<br><br>Overall it's a nice game, but it really needs to work on telling you where and what you are <b>supposed<\/b> to be doing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30323501', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30323501' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30323501\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30323501' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30323501\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30323501', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30323501_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30323501_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30239583\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mieti\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"83429500\">sandvichkin v3.0<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPretty good. Engaging storyline. The main town itself feels quite large, filled with characters who are interesting and quirky with very witty dialogue. More than that, though, the characters and the world does feel very real and you can probably lose a few hours immersing yourself in the town. In this respect, Hot Tin Roof does the point and click part well, but the controls aren't tight enough to be a great platformer, and there is quite a bit of platforming after completing the first area. Level design doesn't hold your hand (which I really enjoy) and might need a bit of thinking to get through. Problematic platforming aside, I'm enjoying it so far.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30239583', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30239583' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30239583\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30239583' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30239583\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30239583', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30239583_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30239583_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30201310\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cecesucks\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"155286348\">sweetdumpling<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 26.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally love this game! It's quirky, funny and everything I looked for. The dialouge is great. Except...<br><br>The controls are iffy. It is hard to climb and is more platformer than I hoped for. When I got this game, I had no idea it was a platformer. It is really easy to fall through the floor and end up all the way at the bottom. It's terrible because there is no frequent saving!!  I really want to advance but I keep getting stuck in the same place over and over again. The reloading is hard especially since a lot of the time, you need to use multiple bullets. <br><br>Another thing, I got lost so much because there is no map and the game is so complex. There is so many ways to get anywhere and if you missed anything at all, you will get nowhere.  Very frustrating.<br><br>I really love this game but it's too hard.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30201310', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30201310' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30201310\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30201310' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30201310\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30201310', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30201310_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30201310_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29329130\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198125118164\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"164852436\">Hooded<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is a funny little adventure game where you take the role of former firefighter, now Private investigator Emma Jones and her partner Franky (a cat). The game's plot revolves around Emma investigating a chain of criminal activities through out the city. You have to explore the city, find clues, ask people about the case, get a search and\/or arrest warrant, collect items, etc. To do all this, you have your trusty revolver which can shoot different types of bullet, i.e. grapple bullets, bubble, knockback, etc. Each has their own unique use in the gameplay.<br><br>The world is not too big but interesting. I love how the animals (cats, rats, pigeons, etc.) are members of the society in a way that they are treated almost like people. I mean, we have a cat running for mayor, rats going on bad deals, a pigeon trying to get his life together, etc.<br><br>The way the game is presented is good, they give the audience an idea on what kind of game it is.<br><br>The graphics is well done (in my opinion anyway). It's not the realistic type of graphic but more of a minecraft block type (but more cartoonish) and that really makes the game more alluring. The colors used are somewhat dim and that compliments the solving mystery vibe of the game.<br><br>The sounds used in the game are the classic detective movie music. The ones where a detective enters a bar and a guy is playing a clarinet type of music. This gives that &quot;Im a classic detective&quot; vibe for me.<br> <br>Gameplay wise, the game only allow you to walk left, right, up, and down. You can also jump and climb stuffs using your revolver. The game as an adventure game also feels like a puzzle, but the easy kind. You have to use your tools in order to progress further. Your health bar is symbolized by a flower in the top left of the screen. Each time you take damage you lose a petal. You have a default of 4 petals and as you progress, you can gain more petals.<br><br>There are also dialogue choices present but I find that they give no significant changes in the story, I think they are just there to let you give Emma and Franky some sort of personality. Although some dialogue are funny and from time to time the game makes my giggle. Another thing about this game is to save, you need to use the toilet. This was a very clever mechanic and made me love the game even more.<br><br>Now for the bad bits. There was one instance in the game where as I was going down the camera didn't follow my character and so I was unable to see my character. I can still here them walking and jumping but I can't see them. This forced me to load a previous save. Another this with the camera, sometimes it goes crazy. Like it goes left and right, but this is on specific areas.<br><br>Additionally, there is a part in the game where you kind of need to grind to earn some bits(currency) in order to purchase some tools but it isnt that much of an issue.<br><br>Overall, I give the game an 8\/10.<br><br><br>Check out more game reviews by me and other people here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/cassus.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/cassus.org\/<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29329130', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29329130' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29329130\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29329130' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29329130\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29329130', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29329130_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29329130_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28493967\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cprn\/recommended\/253390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"130492109\">Cy<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 16.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCriminal investigations for all ages.

Simplistic graphics and unique platformer design make for a great casual title with a little twist of humour.
