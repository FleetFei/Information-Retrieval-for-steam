thing is yet again very possible<br>- expiriance points system on multiplayer is very bad (same xp for a 1 lap or a 20 laps race)<br>- same engine sound use 2 different cars (Ford Sierra and Lancia Delta have the same engine sound for example and some others like that)<br>- THERES NO CORVETTE IN THE GAME!<br><br>As a fan of a GRID series this game deserves a great 8.5\/10 it's a great realistic racing game that most of us wanted at the first place after GRID 1,but on the other hand there is a big taste of this being just a very quick game build and a remake of GRID 2\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30587227', 'summary' );

It's been promoted as the \u2018community's game\u2019 with many of the new additions\/changes from GRID 2 being done based on our feedback. Many love it &amp; many despise it, with myself falling in the middle as I feel both viewpoints when I play. <br><br>Although this may read as a negative (<i>&amp; long lol<\/i>) review, let me state straight off the bat that GRID Autosport (GAS) is a solid racing game, its fast, challenging &amp; fun to drive with a good selection of tracks (some new, some old), a decent range of balanced cars &amp; various modes to choose from. At the end of the day that is what a good racing game should deliver &amp; is why I give it a 'Thumbs Up' overall. It is easy to sink a lot of hours into GAS. That being said, although I do think this is a decent improvement over GRID 2 (and more closely aligned to GRID 1), it is still most lacking from being the definitive PC racing experience for me, so let me explain in more detail. <br><br>One of the main disappointments for me was the Career mode. Actually, not really a Career it\u2019s more an offline practice mode for your multiplayer career, as it primarily only a series of single events. Each series is a season (huh?), and you simply progress by completing each series in sequence for each racing discipline. Once you reach certain level, you unlock the GRID Tournament events which are larger playlist of all racing disciplines (with around 10 events). There are about 500 races in total which is approximately three times as many races as career in GRID 2, but this is basically it! It's boring!<br><br>You cannot run your own team as in GRID 1, as in GAS you are a <i>driver for hire<\/i>, so no choice of car, livery or sponsors etc. Nothing to work towards collecting or unique events (like 24 Hours of Le Mans) to aim for, or other things you need to unlock... it\u2019s just mindlessly follow the event list. Team co-op would have been nice to see in GAS, but obviously not setup with that in mind (focus clearly seems to be on Multiplayer, but more on that later). There is also no choice to specialise your career to say just Touring Cars or stick with one team, as you are forced to complete all disciplines &amp; teams seem random based on the event. <br><br>AI is an improvement to a degree, with much tougher competition to contend with from GRID1-2, which is a huge plus to the experience. They still suffer from being overly aggressive, will not honour racing line and will often cause you to have multiple restarts after the notorious first corner. Still with the improved physics, handling &amp; damage models in GAS, it makes it less hurtful than getting hit by AI in GRID2, let\u2019s say, but it remains a source of frustration. In the end it forces you to race aggressively too, rather than racing a 'proper' race.<br><br>Likewise with the AI, it seems to have minimal randomness, from seemingly predictable lap times to the driving results. In offline <i>'ahem career'<\/i> mode, your racing team mate will almost always finish last making it unlikely, even when you win every race, that your team will win the event. I also noticed some strange behaviour when team mate is winning all through the race &amp; you overtake, he almost immediately drops position after position every time! Also a little odd, the AI seem to race faster than qualifying laps. You could be 6-8 seconds ahead in qualify, yet struggle to keep up in the race or find on some tracks the AI are always super-fast &amp; others they are always super-slow; they seem predefined and not adaptable to your experience.<br><br>AI get a boost at race start so you always play catch-up for the first few corners, which means you miss out on all the starting grid hustle or you start on pole and get taken out from behind! These sort of issues end up drawing your attention the more you play &amp; end up breaking your immersion.<br><br>Moving on from Career &amp; AI, the Multiplayer online component of GAS has got more positive feature changes. There is a much longer progression curve, where you also level up your purchased cars to provide more modification. You can join a club (or create your own) &amp; compete against your friends &amp; the world. Clubs seem to be underutilised (no event creation, no group racing, no club vs club, limited in-game info\/management). There is an improved Global Challenges with tough times &amp; decent rewards. Overall, I have found the online racing experience to be much better than in GRID 2. Damage is more severe (&amp; costly) although this unfortunately doesn't prevent bad drivers taking you out first corner, or any corner for that matter (Kick from game is improved tho :)). <br><br>Matchmaking &amp; finding games still needs much improvement. Online play is still region locked, which was a big issue in GRID 2 still not addressed for those outside of UK\/US. It means for players like me in Australia, where online games are limited that I cannot race with others around the world without changing my Steam client region. This segments the community &amp; is compounded by a lack of visibility of the games in progress to see what you might like to join. Matchmaking is good to have but not at the expense of manually finding games too; this is console-centric online play not PC in my view. You eventually give up trying to find a specific active game mode as it normally isn't populated with any active games anyways (&amp; you don't know what is), so you just choose the Random playlist.<br><br>It would have been great to also be able to create your own customised playlists in advance &amp; save them for selection later online. So you can prepare as a host &amp; setup some unique configurations for others to race.<br><br>Most of these issues or limitations I have highlighted you can live with, although not as good as I expected, there is enough done decently to make it fun to race! Those that wanted the cockpit view however, may be disappointed as this is not much more than an in-car angle, blurry without a real cockpit functionality. Not an issue for me, but just to mention for others that might be an important factor.<br><br>Omitted from the original release version due to issues was Time Trial mode. This has returned in the July 14 patch (in limited form). You can <u>only<\/u> choose the primary circuits (not the 100+ variations), no reverse tracks &amp; selection is limited to the discipline. Still no friends times in career mode (ala GRID 2) nor any online times recorded. Great to have this feature finally to compete with your friends, but is lessened by limited implemenation. <br><br>There are other artificial limitions throughout GAS, such as limited garage slots, limited custom cup events to 5, limited number of laps, or the extra long multiplayer grind. Rather than fixing some of these, CM instead brings out a XP Booster &amp; Garage Pack DLCs for us to buy! These are a joke &amp; are simply a money grabbing endeavor providing a solution to a problem they created. Shameful!<br><br>Players from GRID 2 will also find a lot of reused components in GAS, such as cars\/wheels\/logos\/livery patterns\/tracks. This is not necessarily a bad thing to maximise the amount of content &amp; customisation, but it does feel light on new content. I would have liked to see more of everything or at least some integrated modding support for community to create its own?<br><br>GAS is still a blast but it's far from a perfect game. I think CM can do better which is why I feel disappointment seeing some of the corners cut in GAS (<i>pun intended .. time penalty enforced!<\/i>). The 4k UHD Texture pack brings GAS back up to code graphically, but still feels more like an expansion to GRID 2. Can't help but to feel its rushed &amp; not well enough rounded (or refined) to be a real classic!<br><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\"

depends on what you expect.<br>But if you take it for what it is, you will discover a really good and enjoyable arcade racer!<br>Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>It has good graphics, except for the blurry cockpit view, but with the dashboard cam I find it alright!<br>Sound is alright too, and the tracks are nice and detailed.<br>Even if some known tracks can be hard to recognize when you drive on them.<br>The damage model is excellent, with cracked windows, scratches and dents, twisted metal, lost car parts and sparks!<br>Your car will also be harder to drive and steer the more you crash \/ bump into things.<br><br>There are many cars and championship events with thrilling, exciting races.<br>10 hours in, and I have only scratched the surface of Modern touring championship and Open wheel, and tested some other modes.<br>I do multiply the number of laps in options though.<br><br>The AI is decent and somewhat competitive.<br>They are agressive and will do some cheap blockings, but they just trying to keep their positions and I don't find them to agressive.<br><br>What goes for the physics, I find it driveable and it handles better than Grid 1 did.<br>So I think it will please many casual players!<br><br><br>One thing I really don't like is the preprogrammed DLC!<br>I also bought the Touring Legends pack, a good pack, but no download was needed after the purchase!..<br>So they are already in the game, hidden away from us from the start!<br>That is really, really low Codemasters!!<br><br>So I say go for it!<br>But don't buy the DLC, atleast not to full price, <br>This kind of behavior from Devs should not be supported!!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a

hours with Grid Autosport.<br><br>How did I get access to this you ask? Here's the shortish version.<br>I'd just upgraded and sent my old parts to a friend who is currently out of work in Greece. Hi Miatakias <br><br>He NEEDED to upgrade and no-one I knew wanted the bits. So off they went.<br>He fitted them but after he installed his current GFX card drivers he got blank screen. Nothing we tried fixed it nor did any suggestions from these forums or others.<br>Then I stumbled on an official 5 month old thread on their site saying a fix is still weeks away.<br>Having 2 AMD 6970's on the go and a pair of replacements planned, I decided to send him one of my 6970's as well. For me it meant playing half speed for a while but at least I COULD play.<br><br>Loore had sent me a message and asked me about Miatakias' problem, I told him the above story and that the GFX card was going soon. <br>Miatakias was over the moon with the parts when we got them running and asked if I was going to buy GAS? if so he wanted to buy it for me as thank you for the parts I'd sent.<br><br>I contacted Loore later to let him know all was now ok with the PC and how Miatakias reacted, I got this back.<br>&quot;Loore May 10<br>Tell him not to buy your copy, I've got it covered  Consider it a reward for helping make the GRID community a better place.&quot;<br>Cool, a freebe for bein a nice guy and helping someone out <br><br>To my surprise, when Loore contacted me again. He supplied me with a passcode for the game plus the access to the press preview levels and cars we've seen in vids. Stroll on!<br>All hush, hush till now so here goes..<br><br><br>A week with Grid Autosport.<br><br>16 hours played and tested as I write this and upload some eyefinity vids.<br><br>1st off. The big one... The handling, Is it any good? Did they listen to all the whining we did?<br><br>Ooooohhh yes it's good VERY good, and yes again, they did listen to us fans of old and acted on it (or most of it so far?).<br>FINALLY! After years of waiting, we get a trueblooded, direct descendant of Grids epic gameplay. <br>Grippy cars on tarmac that you need to DRIVE to succeed. Slide any race car about like you had to in Grid 2 and you'll fail at the first corner.<br><br>Driving Autosport right on the limits of speed vs grip round Istanbul Park intermediate and the old grey matter started fizzing again, those Grid ingrained responses to what I was seeing on screen and feeling through the wheel took over and the Grin was back.<br><br>The assists are of the same style as Grid 1, where turning them off made every car soo much harder to control leading to slower lap times. <br>Paradoxically though turning off the assists in GAS lead to the opposite, better times than I got when they were on. I might have been fighting with the stability control instead of letting it do its job here.<br>Precise throttle control is critical for success but you reap the rewards for such restraint. so analogue controllers or wheels will do well, no idea regarding KB as I never had much in the way of KB skills to start with.<br><br>Bear in mind this is press preview and not full release. Only 4GBs it's just the core game elements I'm playing with. I'm playing on this lot. <br><br>AMD 9590 @5GHz, Asus Sabretooth Rev 2, 16GB DDR3 @2133MHz, Sapphire 8GB R9 290X all running 3 screens @ 5932x1080 maxxed out GFX, AA, AF settings etc with 50 fps as a minimum. Using my old and trusted DFGT wheel for the tricky bits.<br><br>So Here's some vids of the basic career modes, All in eyefinity taken using fraps and saved using windows live movie maker. <br><br>1st up, Touring cars Istanbul Park Intermediate.<br><br>The racing is just as much fun as the original Grid was for me. trading paint with a bit of shoulder barging here and there, got slapped by the corner cut system, so that works. <br>The &quot;x5 race&quot; option made for same fun racing over 15 or 20 laps but be warned, In 1 event  I lead from pole and no contact with the AI cars, I lost 5th gear all the rest were fine this made the last 2 laps  somewhat interesting.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/_XcgMprvQYg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/_XcgMprvQYg<\/a><br><br>Street Racing, Washington in the Mini Cooper S Works<br><br>Trying to get the &quot;lift off&quot; corners just right was soo much fun. as was trying to get clean passes.<br> I DID manage a complete race with no contact in this class but it was hard to get, you'll see why....<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/2P4_-BDfidU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/2P4_-BDfidU<\/a><br><br>Drift Tuner, An essential for myself and a few others around here.<br><br>Ruined in Grid 2 with tea tray on ice handling, Drift's back to the circuits (or 1 at least in the preview) Tracks are split into &quot;Score sectors&quot; so no multilap chains of drifts scaring off all but the pro's.<br>Precise control inputs are a must here if you want to look like a pro <br>You can still hoon it like a BOSS with style and get points, I'm off for some much needed practice....;D <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/HgFNrsVQjNA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/HgFNrsVQjNA<\/a><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/I4M0PYsZpBw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/youtu.be\/I4M0PYsZpBw<\/a><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/nuWe8y2luWQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/youtu.be\/nuWe8y2luWQ<\/a><br><br>Open Wheel, Yas Marina (and dodgy cockpit view)<br><br>Slipstreaming is back just a shame the cockpit view looks like it's &quot;unfinished&quot; or an &quot;afterthought&quot;  at best and so it's of no practical use to the headcam, hud off players.<br>The mirrors are like impresionist black and white paintings of the skyline behind you. <br>Like a tiny wee policeman pops up wherever you look saying &quot;Nothing to see here, move along...&quot; This has to be unfinished or the Modders got some work to do again....<br>Again though, it's only the press preview surely it'll be better for launch day<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/bg79ms19tGo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/youtu.be\/bg79ms19tGo<\/a><br><br>Endurance, be careful, this category bites.... No pit stops.<br><br>Tyre wear in Grid? HUH? Well much as I wouldn't have missed it, it does add a big tactical element to your driving. In an 8 minute race grip dissapears like an ice cube in a volcano, I kid you not.<br>1st try, I shot off into the blue, by the end of a lap I shredded 20% in less than 1:30 and had none for the end. You really neeed to nurse the tyres as on the 2nd try I used only 6% in one lap and still won the race albeit with 30 and 32% left of the rear tyres. <br>Pit stops would help here but it's about tyre management instead of outright speed.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/mn1sr0ca4HI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/youtu.be\/mn1sr0ca4HI<\/a><br><br>As I said above it's the core of the game here and no where near complete, though with the way it handles, looks and plays right now I would be buying a copy without a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>Ferreted about

begin?<br><br>-Physics-<br>The Physics in this game are completely different from the past games, they are more like a simcade<br>Its not Assetto Corsa or Project Cars kind of simulation level but it still has a little touch as a Simcade game.<br><br>-Cars-<br>Haven't heard of half the cars in this game and didn't know they existed, surprised me a lot. just like Race Driver GRID back in 2008, full of surprises!<br>And of course the detail in the cars is insane in terms of damage and such.<br><br>-Tunning-<br>I always wanted the customization at Autosport since 2008 and i finally got it!<br>Finally i can set down force, suspensions, brakes bias, differential etc the way i always wanted!<br>I can upgrade my engine, clutch and more stuff under my hood! insane!<br><br>-Tracks-<br>A huge amount of tracks in this game, all around Europe, Asia, Australia, America and more based on real life. as good as it gets they are big as well.<br><br>-Graphics-<br>Beautiful graphics, and my pc is not amazing and i still manage to run it on high with a 16:9 resolution and get a really good fps. so i'll admit, the game engine is as good as it is since always!<br><br>-Car Sounds-<br>Obviously not the only game which has really realistic engine sounds and definitely not the best one.<br>But they are great and i love them, and they make me wanna boost my corsair all the way to 100% volume.<br><br>-Multiplayer-<br>Compared to GRID 2, this game finally brought back the wide space roads from GRID 2008 which means multiplayer is actually playable without having the whole lobby totaled at the first few corners.<br>Match making is nice too, i can find races fast and easily without too much pain and also have a voice chat feature which is nice.<br>Weekly\/Daily multiplayer challenges are cool too.<br>And i love the fact that i can buy whatever car i want again whether its a brand new car or a used car from &quot;ebay&quot;. <br>Just like the old days in GRID 2008!<br><br>-Controller Support-<br>Supports joypads, gamepads, wheel, keyboard and everything you can dream of.<br>The game is also very balanced so its very playable with keyboard as well for a simcade.<br><br>-Camera-<br>Good to see the rewind feature is still here, very useful indeed!<br>And the replay feature after finishing a race also has an option to hide hud and upload on youtube directly from the game. <br>Also has various cameras positions which is cool as well.<br><br>The only down sides of this game i could think of are:<br>-A broken cockpit cam<br>-Can't make my own team and hire my own team mates<br>-No drifting mountains like the old days.<br><br>But overall, i'm glad codemasters listened to the community and its requests and gave us most of the things we asked for.<br><br>We were also introduced to Drag which is brand new to GRID which is cool as well! <br>8\/10 from me, i really want those drift mountains.\t\t\t\t\t<div

details of sending a car around a track as quickly as possible. Autosport caters to the latter. Those who enjoy buying, tuning and personalizing their dream cars should leave this game on the shelf. Grid Autosport offers very little theater, ditching the fictitious racing series and fake Sportscenter news clips in favor of no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t rubber on tarmac racing. Players will find that they are free to move between different touring car races, endurance races, open wheel racing, tuner events and street races. Players level up in each race type independently and in doing so they unlock new events and sponsors as well as Grid race series events. The freedom ends there however. Once an event is selected players are given the choice between two race teams who have pre selected cars and unappealing liveries. While certainly a realistic touch, it takes the joy out of earning your favorite rides and making them your own. Additionally, each sponsor has different objectives and tuning affinities. The higher their affinity for tuning the more settings players will have to tweak their machines so choosing a sponsor is more like choosing the difficulty of a series and additional experience can be earned by succeeding with an underdog team. <br>\t<br>The realism continues once players are secured via five point harness behind the wheel. If you are expecting to be at the front of the pack then participating in qualifying is necessary. Forgoing qualifying laps mean fighting to the front of a dense 12 to 16 player field and contending with some seriously aggressive AI. An extensive damage model and strict penalties for cutting corners means that moving up a position or two is a bitter fight. It feels like an accomplishment to move through the pack but since most races consist of two or three laps aggressive racing is essential and often times you will find yourself crossing the finish line with a car that has wrecked steering and is not pushing as much horsepower as when the race started. Race ending collisions can occur and like Grid 2 the damage models set a genre standard. Unfortunately, qualifying means completing every race twice and qualifying isn't a possibility for certain race series. For those who don't have an obsession with cleaving a tenth of a second off of a lap time it's tedious. <br>\t<br>Also complicating matters is the fact that most race events have you teamed up with an AI driver who helps determine your placement in the team standings at the end of a season. Perhaps I made a habit of selecting the wrong sponsor, but my teammates all seemed to be tailpipe fetishists who were content to follow the entire field. While it is possible to order commands for your teammate to drive more aggressively or hold their position it seems to have little effect other than hearing your partner spin out if you forget to back them off of the most aggressive behavior setting. Fortunately, the opponent AI also makes mistakes but all too often the work you put into capturing a podium finish is undermined by your teammate, ultimately costing you valuable experience at the end of the season. Gaining experience is essential to progressing through the career so it doesn't take long before the game feels like a grind.<br>\t<br>Variety is a hallmark of the Grid series and Autosport offers touring car racing, endurance racing, open wheel racing, street racing and tuner racing. Endurance races take place over a fixed time and the driver that travels the furthest in the allotted time wins. It's is possibly the most challenging race type since careful and consistent driving is required to stay at the front of the pack and protect the soft rubber that keeps your machine on the road. Open wheel racers are incredibly fragile and the threshold between cornering at max speed and being murdered in a nasty crash is thinner than a human hair. Open wheel racing in Autosport is not as complex as Codemasters' own F1 series since adaptive aerodynamics and the KERS system have been omitted but never the less offers a commendable and accessible experience. Tuner races are largely comprised of time attacks and drift events. Street races tend to be the most enjoyable events simply because the excise the game's long list of real world grand prix tracks in favor of the more detailed city based tracks. Finally, touring car events adhere to the addage of rubbing is racing by placing you behind the wheel of road cars tuned to unrecognizable specifications while you bump and bash your way through corners defending your position against a tightly knit field of racers. Sadly, togue events are absent from Autosport and the live route system\u2014possibly one of the most intriguing features in a racing game in years is also absent. Additionally, players varying tastes means that some events will become a tremendous test of patience for some and leveling across all event types is essential to unlock Grid events. Once again the vehicle selection is slim but covers a tremendous variety of machines, including the platypus of the automotive world: the Aussie Ute. <br>\t<br>Online is much the same in Autosport as it was in Grid 2 with both weekly challenge events and direct competition with 11 other drivers. Cars have to be earned one by one and leveling up each of the racing disciplines contributes to your overall level and unlocks more slots in your garage. Each car must be leveled up through use, unlocking tuning options and upgrades. This proves to be highly problematic however since it takes an absurd amount of time to unlock enough tuning options for the feature to be usable. Tuning is a delicate art\u2014the kind of thing you would do with a scalpel and Autosport's initial instinct is to provide you with a jackhammer. Tuning options are controlled via sliders and the greater your affinity for tuning, the more settings available along the slider. Also the way vehicle availability is divided between race types and classes within each race type means that it's hard to dedicate yourself to using a single vehicle in order to upgrade it. All this comes together to make online play a grind of it's own.<br>\t<br>Autosport does provide an excellent assortment of tracks across it's single player and online suits, many of the tracks in Grid 2 can be found here as well as a large selection of new Grand Prix tracks\u2014many of which are not found in any other mainstream racing games. The most exciting inclusion is the brand new Circut of the Americas with it's tight hairpins, long straits and winding sections. While Codemasters has included a number of details that liven up the real life Gran Prix tracks, races through the game's cityscapes is far more captivating and lively. Presentation wise, Autosport maintains the same high quality as Grid 2 but by popular demand a cockpit view has been added. Corners have been cut however with a depth of field filter that blurs the detals in the cockpit. <br><br>utosport makes some strides toward addressing the issues that many TOCA and Grid fans had with Grid 2 but features enough quirks and questionable design choices to remain frustrating. It's a game that caters to serious race fans and shrugs off features that lend themselves toward giving players a sense of progression. You are simply a driver tied to a team that you are in no way invested in, who is, in turn, leashed to a corporate sponsor. It's a bit of realism that most gamers could do without. Autosport is a challenging racing game with perfect handling and tenacious AI but the dense racing fields and low lap counts combined with a rigorous damage model can irritate. Extensive plans for DLC also raise eyebrows and will likely cause would be wheel-men to steer around this entry.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11544223', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11544223' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11544223\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11544223' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11544223\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11544223', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11544223_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11544223_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30909543\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048549763\/recommended\/255220\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"88284035\">Mik<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 142.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysics are good, tracks are good, AI players are fun, very clean presentation. After the disappointing GRID 2 this feels like they took the original GRID, updated the graphics and added more cars and tracks, then polished it to an absolute shine. Unlike GRID 2 there is little attempt at anything new here (in fact the career has less features then GRID 1), instead it's all about getting what they had in GRID 1 perfected. The one innovation is how the AI difficulty is handled, it's a subtle change but it can almost ruin you for other racing games because their rubber banding becomes so obvious compared to how 'fair' the AIs in Autosport appear.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30909543', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30909543' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30909543\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30909543' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30909543\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30909543', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30909543_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30909543_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30832869\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198366474116\/recommended\/255220\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"406208388\">Nutteloos<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have played alot of racing games from codemasters, and just like all of them i really enjoy playing GRID Autosport. This game has the perfect balance between realism and arcade. The racing is pretty realistic with real life cars and racetracks, but the driving physics feel a bit more arcade. It's not a simulator, and it's not unrealistic. It's in the middle of the two. That's one of the reasons i really like this game, even after the first 3 hours. (if i change my mind i will edit my review)<br><br>Good;<br>-Real tracks + Cars<br>-Multiple classes and cars<br>-Well optimised, (playable on high settings with not so good pc)<br>-Very nice graphics when on high\/ultra<br>-Great AI that actually races you pretty good<br>-You can tell teammate to attack\/defend<br><br>Bad;<br>-Price, I don't think this game is worth 39,99 euro's. I really suggest you to buy it on a sale, or from a site that will offer steam keys Because i don't think this is worth 39,99<br><br>Even though it's a bit pricey, i really recommend this game if you are into racing games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30832869', 'recent_short' );
