TL; DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!<\/div><br>Maize is a first person adventure game about sentient corn, and the scientists who developed them.<br><br>The game starts off with you being dragged around by corn, and then waking up in the corn field without any idea of what just happened. I was very curious about this sentient corn, and how it came to be. As you venture into the research facility, the story focuses more on the scientist\u2019s overly dramatic relationship with each, rather than the how or why of the whole situation, so expect to read a lot of dialog on post-it notes from these two. By the end, I find myself left wanting more details about the sentient corn, and I think they could have done more with the story.<br><br>The gameplay is mostly what you would expect from a first person adventure game, but with a lot more of a walking simulator feel to it. You\u2019ll need to walk around, explore, and find objects to complete tasks to unlock other areas and progress. There\u2019s not much difficulty in completing these objectives since you can see the shape of the objects that you need to find, and the objects also have hints on them about what their use might be.<br><br>After a little progression, you get a sidekick named Vladdy. He\u2019s a sentient teddy bear that you\u2019ll need to do some tasks for you. In contrast to Vladdy, the different corn characters were amusing, and entertaining at times, so I liked them, and would have liked to have seen more of them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>interesting concept, and the corn characters are amusing, and will likely lead so some smiles at the sheer ridiculousness of it all<br><\/li><li>there are quite a few collectibles to find, and some of the flavour text is amusing<br><\/li><li>graphics look good for the most part, and there are more environments than you'd expected; some of them seemed out of place, but it fits the whole nonsensical theme of the game<br><\/li><li>music is fine throughout the game<br><\/li><li>voice acting is good for all of the characters<br><\/li><li>sound effects are mostly good, (except for the mechanical sound when Vladdy walks, which is a bit irritating)<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>short game with lacking in substance, and they could have done so much more with the story (it took me about 3-3.5 hours to finish, and that was with me finding and reading almost all of the collectibles)<br><\/li><li>obnoxious light bloom and flickering the lights all over the walls in a couple areas is hard on the eyes (more settings to adjust graphical effects would be nice - at least most areas were okay)<br><\/li><li>your sidekick Vladdy is extremely annoying, and he constantly insults you, and everything around you with the same lame phrases, like \u2018stupid,\u2019 \u2018idiot,\u2019 and \u2018trash\u2019 over and over again... (I know it\u2019s intended that he\u2019s got such a negative personality, and I just wanted him to shut up, and go away)<br><\/li><li>(nitpick) keybindings are not customizable, and there is only partial controller support<br><\/li><li>(nitpick) had a fatal error and crashed right before the end (no progress was lost)<\/li><\/ul><br>Performance wise, I was usually able to maintain 60 fps on epic settings with some occasional drops (GTX 1070). <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion:<\/div>Maize has a ridiculously fun and silly concept, and it\u2019s definitely a game that doesn\u2019t take itself seriously. The sheer goofiness of it all made me smile at times, but the constant overuse of the same insults gets very, very annoying. I also found the game to be lacking in content for the price, and I would have liked more depth to the story. Overall, it was an alright experience; it\u2019s not great game, but it\u2019s not a bad one either.<br><br>You can also view this review on my website <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.azralynn.com\/review-maize-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >here.<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28151178', 'summary' );

It's as if the X-Files and Day of the Tentacle got together to create a genetically altered baby in the 80's and then hired the Monty Python team to teach it to read &amp; write. <br><br>So Maize starts off strong dropping you in the middle of a mysterious farm with just hints as to what lies beneath the surface (literally). A wonderfully realised world of weaving paths and object puzzles that are a staple of point 'n' click genre. All of which is brought to life with the power of the Unreal engine, that gives the game an undeniable visual flair.<br><br>And even though there is a fair amount of back-tracking the game never feels artificially long, like a lot of those older point and clicks. With the paths all clearly marked out and the puzzles though not blatantly obvious are easy enough to solve and never frustrating. Also the story unfolds nicely in the various cut scenes with polished animations and high quality voice acting. <br><br>But there are one or two things that stick in my teeth (like a stale corn husk).<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ErsxCi307x4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ErsxCi307x4<\/a><br><br>Despite the developers saying the game will take 6-10 hours it will infact only take you about 3-3.5 hours to complete. And if you are not a big fan of linear games this may well be a little too &quot;walking simulator&quot; for you with none of the puzzles really providing much of a challenge.<br><br>Also after the first hour things start getting a little repetitive. Jokes and puzzles start getting recycled and you start to get the feeling the game may well have been scaled back and short cuts taken in development after those opening sections. Bugs and glitches become more noticeable, with texture pop in becoming more and more frequent as you open up more of the facility. I also noticed major performance issues about two thirds of the way through. On returning to the farm I suffered a lot of dropped frames and lag. Which is a little disappointing considering how well presented the game is.<br><br>All in all I would recommend Maize, especially for anyone who has enjoyed games like The Stanley Parable. Though I would say to maybe curb your expectations. It is a fairly short game with not a lot of challenge but a nice enough story to carry you through.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28124642', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28124642' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28124642\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28124642' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28124642\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28124642', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28124642_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28124642_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28227259\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"25953476\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fae0b39d26094fce6141701a4cb82bd0448ade92.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fae0b39d26094fce6141701a4cb82bd0448ade92.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fae0b39d26094fce6141701a4cb82bd0448ade92_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/\" data-miniprofile=\"25953476\">Spasman<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/games\/?tab=all\">495 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spasman\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI played this outside of Steam, and bought it since I liked it so much.<br><br>I thought Maize was going to be another UE4 example edit turned walking sim, but I guess I was wrong about that. The game has a lot of love put into it, and actually has enough stimulating puzzle gameplay to keep itself out of the walking sim genre.<br><br>The animations and music are really charming, and I really enjoyed the voice acting too. I don't know if the developers are amateur or a full studio but I could be convinced it were the latter. I love the environments a lot (especially that 80s looking IT lab) and the passive aggressive sticky notes (that remind me of work emails) were a nice little way to tell a side story and develop two characters.<br><br>I think my favorite thing about the game is it is fairly funny, but the best part of that is I can't remember a single instance of an internet meme or a pop culture reference. Most of the humor was original, and that is becoming very lost in games that make comedy a focus nowadays, because they're either trying really hard to appeal to Lets Players or children, almost alienating people who actually want to play the game instead of watch it on youtube. This game's sense of humor establishes itself in its own way and firmly grips to being original all the way through. 100% I'd much rather hear an original bad joke then listen to some character blather about me getting epicly rekt or coyly mention pepe the frog or their favorite twitch emote is Kappa or some other dumb sh<b><\/b>it.<br><br>The little bear sidekick was cute, but he got really taxing after a while when his dialogue got repetitive and predictable. I know I'm a &quot;stupid idiot&quot; but there are only so many combinations to make out of those two words in the existing English language. He sort of grew on me in a &quot;hes an annoying character, but hes my annoying character&quot; way, though I think they could've made him a bit more likable.<br><br>And while I do say it had gameplay, the &quot;take object and apply to another object&quot; concept got flat after a while. Thankfully the game is short so it doesn't get too tedious, however short games may turn people away. Some of the object interactions were clever\/funny though, like using a stupid broken shovel handle to tip over a cabinet that you could of just done yourself. That could probably get lost on some players (THATS DUMB WHY NOT JUST TIP IT MYSELF) but I imagine thats the joke.<br><br>The game is also fairly unoptimized. Ran like crap on my 1080 (id say ~40-50fps the whole time). I'm no UE developer, but I think the trick to that engine is to put a lot of focus on the optimization and let the engine do the rest of the work. I also had a Fatal Error crash during the ending of the game but I'm sure thats been fixed or reported by now.<br><br>Overall, the initial price may seem steep if you've heard the game is short, but the price is invested in other areas such as writing, animation and audiowork. A game doesn't need to be 10+ hours long to be good. Hope to see more wacky imaginative games from these guys in the future.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28227259', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28227259' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28227259\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28227259' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28227259\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28227259', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28227259_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28227259_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28129188\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LordDickinson\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"68223001\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a04fbf1490d448d4de8409a63e443d145569c047.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a04fbf1490d448d4de8409a63e443d145569c047.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a04fbf1490d448d4de8409a63e443d145569c047_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LordDickinson\/\" data-miniprofile=\"68223001\">Lord Dickinson<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LordDickinson\/games\/?tab=all\">240 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LordDickinson\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LordDickinson\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am certainly no expert in the field of point and click adventures, but these are my 2 cents on the game:<br><br>Pros:<br>Doesn't take itself seriously without being overly indulgend on self deprecating humor.<br>Has some good laughs through clever writing and subversion of expectations.<br>Graphics are nice and fps never dipped below 30 on epic settings, which is still playable for a puzzle game.<br>Keeps you wondering about what is going on.<br>Nice Helicopter<br><br>Cons:<br>10GB Download.

Maize promises a ridiculous, silly first-person puzzle adventure and goes so far beyond any expectations it completely blows you away. It's not gameplay-packed and it's incredibly linear, so anyone who isn't a fan of more narrative-based games should stay away, as its story, characters, and dialogue are where it excels. That said, the gameplay never feels tedious, and there are few, if any, real headscratching moments.<br><br>There are some faults, mostly programming-wise. There are times where I got stuck on level geometry and had to reset, and the outside areas - where individual stalks of corn are rendered blowing in the air - seem abnormally intensive, though my computer isn't built specifically for gaming, so that might be a problem on my end.<br><br>Either way, the issues were not nearly enough to keep me from enjoying this game to the fullest, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for 4-5 hours of a hilarious, compelling, and overall brilliant game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29796246', 'summary' );

Let's not forget the sentient corn.<br><br>But is the game.... <i>Any good?<\/i> <br><br><br><br><u><b>The Good<\/b><\/u><br><b>-Plenty of great humor and charm<\/b> <br><b>-Quality voice acting<\/b> <br><b>-Cool environments to explore and decent looking game over all<\/b><br><b>-OK soundtrack<\/b><br><br>The best aspect of Maize is it's writing and humor. The game really gives me a strong portal vibe in terms of it's sense of humor, for example from the moment you start up the game, the tutorial text is seemingly mocking you through out it.<br><br>It helps as well obviously that the voice acting for all of this is superb, as well as the items you'll collect and find, each item you pick up either in your inventory or your &quot;folio&quot; will have a description of some kind, some of the these I found were the funniest moments in the game for me.<br><br>To even the random sticky notes you'll find across the facility from it's two co-founders who are seemingly opposite personalities.<br><br>Next up are the varied environments you'll be exploring in this game, everything from starting out at at the abandoned farm house, to going down into the facility below the farm itself.<br><br>It helps as well that the over all game looks pretty solid, running on the Unreal engine 4, I played this game on max settings, my experience averaging roughly around 30 fps due to my entry level set up, but considering this is just an adventure game, I was fine with the frame rate.<br><br>As for what you'll be doing in these environments, well there's not really any kind of major puzzle solving, which is fine for me personally as this game is more aimed and advertised as being an adventure game. <br><br>Every puzzle in this game is honestly just finding the correct place for items you've found around the enviroment.<br><br>As for the soundtrack side of things, aside from some of the humorous segments in the game with music built around the game's setting itself, the over all background music is your typical synth tunes and it's nothing too memorable I found.<br><br><u><b>The Bad<\/b><\/u><br><b>-Not really much for puzzles, if at all or any kind of actual challenge, very linear as well<\/b> <br><b>-Graphical settings didn't do much for performance [personal \/ minor]<\/b><br><br>As I said earlier, Maize really doesn't have any kind of actual puzzle solving, everything revolves around simply finding items and placing them in their correct place.<br><br>But with that said, this game also doesn't have any kind of challenge what so ever. Maize starts off feeling vast in terms of what you can explore... But that feeling will quickly dissipate as you realize just how linear the world is, but worse yet how much the game will hold your hand through it.<br><br>For example, you'll notice orange boxes block off certain areas, at first I figured this was for a new area I've not unlocked yet... But in reality once you've found out where the items correctly go in the environment you're in, these boxes will adjust and re-align to guide you to the next area you need to go next to progress.<br><br>So basically the game guides you in the correct direction the entire time using this method, making the over all experience disappointingly linear.<br><br>On more technical side of things I noticed regardless of what graphical setting I was playing on, I didn't really get any boost in performance, now do take this with a grain of salt, as this could be vastly different on different computer set ups.<br><br>But for me personally regardless if I set the game to medium or low to the high or epic setting, I never noticed any boost in performance in terms of frame rate, so I was constantly stuck with 30 frames dipping down into the low 20s at times when I was exploring the general farm area of the game.<br><br>But once I was down inside the facility I was getting anywhere from 30 to 60 frames, so it was pretty sporadic. I'll include my computer specs down below.<br><br>You'll also notice while playing the game is extremely heavy in post processing effects such as huge amounts of motion blur, bloom, etc and I wish I had more control over actually editing specific effects aside from the entire category just being labeled from low to epic.<br><br>As for bugs, during my roughly 4 to 5 hours I spent with Maize I never had any crashes and I only noticed a small bug where the seat of a tractor was magically floating for whatever reason.<br><br><br><u><b>The Opinion<\/b><\/u><br><br>Over all despite my complaints with technical issues and how linear and easy Maize feels, I still had a great time exploring its world and witnessing its cast of characters, the over all writing and humor in my opinion still make this game worth playing and checking out, so if you're looking for this in a game then I can't recommend it enough.<br><br><br><b>Computer specs, EVGA 750ti 2GB, i7 Quadcore CPU @ 2.80ghz, 8GB of DDR3 RAM<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28414253', 'summary' );

You'll be doing plenty of that. <br><br><b> Before I get into the wall of text I need to say this game features what I'd say is one of the best sidekicks\/companions I've seen in a long time. If I could own a Vladdy I totally would make it happen. <\/b><br><br>Fans of adventure games should feel right at home with this one. You can see how the gameplay is from the video above so I'm not going to spend time on that. The game's setting and atmosphere are fantastic and you never really feel out of place. The game does keep you on your toes wondering what the heck is actually going on. The game world is a bit large but there are mechanics in palce to keep you going in the right direction. None of the puzzles are overly complex which but you'll have some headscratchers if you fail to pay attention to some of the hints the game is giving. Explorers and lore readers are highly rewarded in this game. For the completionists there are lore objects scattered around the game world that will most likely require additional playing to collect them all. The story is just as corny as the joke above while at the same time not too far from experimental reality. The character development is spot on and there are a few things that you'll be wondering after the play through. The game length is about 4 hours and has a solid ending with a proper build up.<br><br>All around great game. <br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> There is no reason this is here.

Besides knowing that, i had very little idea about what the story was about, what the gameplay was like, and what, or who, i was even playing as. In today\u2019s age of sometimes being overwhelmed by information about upcoming games (or even movies\/tv shows), it was actually kind of nice to go into this mostly blind. And since I had no idea of what to expect, i learned almost everything about the world, story and characters as i went along. Right from the beginning then, this gave the game a nice sense of mystery. And although it\u2019s a pretty linear experience, that sense of mystery helped make everything feel much more open and interesting as you wandered around, discovering something new around each corner. Add in some witty writing, unique and funny characters, and a wonderfully detailed and graphically enticing world, and you get a very enjoyable little adventure.<br><br>The game begins with you waking up in a corn field. You\u2019ll explore a bit of the surrounding area before descending deeper into a complex below the farm. You quickly realize there were a few people conducting some weird experiments, and from there, you\u2019re on a quest to find out exactly what happened and where everyone went. As you go through the game, you\u2019ll find tons of sticky notes that reveal the history about the place and the people in it. You will also run into a few other characters who will help guide you on your way, fill in more of the story, and insult you constantly. The more lighthearted atmosphere of the game is broken up by a subtle eeriness, that reminded me a lot of the feeling i had in Portal 2, especially the older, subterranean office areas.    <br><br>While gameplay is somewhat minimal, i wouldn\u2019t call it a walking simulator. Most of what you\u2019ll be doing is solving light puzzles, that usually entail finding objects and carrying them around until you can combine them with other objects. Nothing complicated or overly challenging, but enjoyable enough. One of my favorite parts of the game though, deals with the things you find while exploring. Once you get an item, you can bring up a brief description about it, which is always entertaining to read and usually quite funny. I was always excited to find something new for this reason, even if it was just a simple rock on the ground (your character loves rocks). By the end of the game, i was left wanting to know more about the main and supporting characters as well as the complex itself. That\u2019s always a good sign imo, letting me know the developers succeeded in creating a world worth knowing about. As for the controls, you can run and crouch, but no jumping (boo!). And just a heads up for the controller users, you can can use it while actually playing, but not in the menus (at least for the time being).<br><br>Graphically, the game looks really good, especially in the above ground areas. Detailed textures mixed with fitting post process effects and colors help give the game a unique look. I also appreciated the subdued retro aesthetic, that helps add to the history of the farm. You can definitely tell the artists spent a good amount of time making this a visually interesting place to explore. Voice acting is top notch and while there isn\u2019t a ton of music, the tracks that are in it compliment the atmosphere perfectly.<br><br>Like Ghost of a Tale, Albino Lullaby and The Cursed Forest, Maize is another gem of a game that tends to fly under a lot of people\u2019s radars. Which is a shame since it\u2019s such a fun and unique experience. If you\u2019re looking for a quirky, laid-back game, with talking corn and condescending robot bears, this is the one for you! Highly recommended.<br><br>Thanks to Daniel at Finish Line Games and Victoria at Evolve for the review copy.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29160450', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29160450' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29160450\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29160450' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29160450\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29160450', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29160450_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29160450_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30869135\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053927702\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"93661974\">Lesch-9<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Maize for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen I first saw the trailer for Maize I was confused. In fact, I was speechless. It was a strange combination between bombastic humor like that of Saint\u2019s Row and bewildering creepiness as can be found in Albino Lullaby. I knew there was only one way to figure out what that cryptic video meant: by playing it. Maize is a puzzle adventure game chronicling one silent protagonist\u2019s journey through a strange world of secret research facilities and sentient, talking corn. While this may seem like a ridiculous premise to start with, it gets much, much stranger.<br><br>The main mechanic in Maize is inventory based puzzle solving. In general, an item is collected and then used to interact with the environment in a specific way. In every instance, items that can be picked up or interacted with are clearly highlighted in white. To make things even lass ambiguous, locations where objects should be placed are indicated with a blue ghost of the item in question. As a result it was easy to infer from the ghost outline what item was supposed to go where. While such straight forward puzzles might initially feel like a letdown, I believe they are perfectly suited to Maize.<br><br>Those familiar with the puzzle adventure genre will recall, perhaps fondly or more likely with frustration, the kind of convoluted logic required to solve the classic puzzles of games gone by. At times the only real solution to a problem was to apply or click on every item, hoping something might happen. While some games earned the player\u2019s commitment to such puzzles, Maize understands its place perfectly. It can\u2019t entice players to persist in the anticipation of another thrilling plot development or a breathtaking vista. It\u2019s a game about talking corn where rewards come in bite sized pieces of silly nonsense.<br><br>While The Stanley Parable accomplishes similar humor and self-awareness without needing puzzles, Maize is definitely enhanced by its chosen mechanic. Rather than using puzzles as an obstacle to progression, they serve as a vehicle for storytelling and humor. Some of the most hilarious and endearing moments of the game came from puzzles and their solutions. For each item picked up, the player has the option to read a \u201chint\u201d or description of the object. While it may seem like cheating to view the hint for every single one, it became immediately obvious that someone had put quite a lot of time and love into them. Aside from providing useful information, the descriptions include the main character\u2019s reaction to the item written in second person. Often they were charming explanations for how the protagonist misconstrues the usefulness of even the most commonplace objects. In other instances the player is treated to a piece of absurd, unsubstantiated inside information.<br><br>In addition to item description, the puzzle solutions allude to the fantastic bad planning that went into the research facility. Distributed around the compound are sticky notes documenting the long standing squabble between its two Founders. While one conforms to the scientists\u2019 archetype, the other can be described as nothing but an immature lunatic. Whenever there was an interesting set piece which might invite speculation, a string of sticky notes or research documentation would offer a comedic if not compelling explanation.<br><br>If you worry that experiencing much of the game\u2019s narrative second hand might become boring, never fear, there\u2019s a small companion to keep you from getting lonely. I am talking about none other than the sardonic, Russian, puzzle solving teddy bear robot: Vlad. Given the bear\u2019s size and design I was expecting to intermittently trade perspectives with him, controlling Vlad to solve puzzles involving ducts or small gaps. In reality, Vlad is completely autonomous. For the most of the game he simply tags along, offering frequent criticisms of the player\u2019s intelligence. The tiny teddy bear reminded me of another sharp tongued robot: GLaDOS. Despite being evil, she was continuously amusing and endearing for her many varied and imaginative insults. It was actually fun wondering what she might say next. Vlad, on the other hand, is very economical with his insults. There\u2019s only every one. IDIOT! While it\u2019s fun to hear him say this a few times in his heavy Russian accent, by the end of the game it gets a little tiring.<br><br>Bottom line: Is the game worth buying? Yes. Maize offers enough in crisp visuals and comedy to warrant its $20 price tag. Think of it as paying to watch two B movies at the theater. You\u2019ll be entertained for four hours and have something to talk about afterward. While I won\u2019t be storing this in my file of \u201cClassics\u201d it was a fun experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30869135', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30869135' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30869135\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30869135' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30869135\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30869135', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30869135_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30869135_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30745235\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/malachai\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"10261602\">Vertigo Teaparty<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Maize for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMaize was a great experience.

Personally I found this was done in such a way that it didn't feel like hand holding but at the same time cut down on wasted &quot;wander about, figure out WTF to do&quot; time<br>- The description of items are sometimes TOO helpful, on occasion flat out telling the player how to use them to solve the puzzle\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30745235', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30745235' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30745235\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30745235' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30745235\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30745235', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30745235_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30745235_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30740909\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MOSTFABCANADIAN\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"209651505\">MostFabCanadian<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Maize for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was given this game a while ago and never got around to playing it. I mean, a game about corn? However, I soon realized I had so many games in my steam library I had yet to touch, Maize being one of them. So I gave it a try. I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you not, I beat the game in one sitting. <br><br>Maize is a hilarious puzzle video game with a really random plot that I find slightly complicated to explain. However, this game was worth every minute. I got so many laughs out of this that I could barely sit straight on my chair. <br><br>That being said, it doesn't take much to make me laugh.<br><br>The only problems I find in this game is how short it is. I was able to beat the game roughly around 3 hours (was afk for another 3 hours hence why it says 6 hours played) <br><br>Another problem I found was how random it all seemed. Yes, there were genuine laughs. However there's a lot of times where they try to be random. It's common knowledge that RANDOM DOES NOT EQUAL FUNNY.<br><br>Once again, I received this game for free so I can't complain about pricing. However, is the price justifiable for the gameplay? To that, I would have to say no. Perhaps a ten dollar price tag would be better. Essentially it is just a walking simulator and the odd puzzle to beat however in general is very straight forward. <br><br>In general however, the game ran well, I did not experience any noticable glitches in the games. I genuinely had fun playing this game and I would've totally one hundred percent recommend this game to a friend.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30740909', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30740909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30740909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30740909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30740909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30740909', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30740909_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30740909_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30720027\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/VG_Gnome\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"37722112\">VG Gnome<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Maize for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a good experience, kept me solidly entertained for 3 hours.

The humor, the puzzles.  Heck, I even enjoy being called an idiot by a stuffed robot bear!  I'm not by any means a completionist, but I *DID* only find 61 of the 75 Folio objects in the game, and I would replay the game just to try to find the rest.  It was just such an ejoyable experience and a fresh face on the point and click adventure games.  The thing that I found even more amazing is that even though the puzzles where challenging, none of them seemed to keep me stuck for very long, or to seem frustrating.  It was just intuitive, zany and fun!<br><br>This is what exploration\/adventure games should be (in my humble, but obviously correct opinion :)!!!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30561421', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30561421' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30561421\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30561421' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30561421\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30561421', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30561421_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30561421_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30528075\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thepcgamer101\/recommended\/284240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"102548183\">ThePCGamer101<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 15\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine <\/div><br>Maize is a game developed and published by Finish Line Games.
