I'd consider this game to be the best game made by DXF Games up to this point, both in terms of game play polish and variety.<br><br>You play as a cleric whose fellow party members are killed by a dragon. You're then given the choice to loot one of the corpses, then - vowing revenge - you head to a nearby town that serves as a hub for managing equipment and procuring quests to complete. These quests involve anything from killing enemies to retrieving lost items to fishing, among other things.<br><br>Graphically, the game resembles something that you'd play on Sega's battery-munching Game Gear system. Everything's bright and colorful and low-resolution. For the most part, this doesn't get in the way of playability, but it's worth noting that some of the text can be hard to read.<br><br>I daresay that the soundtrack is the highlight of the game for me. The game's developer plays bass guitar, and his band provided the soundtrack for the game. The music on its own is fine and surprisingly fitting for the action, then the vocals start and bring it to a whole other level. They just have this Randy Newman-esque narrative style going on. It's actually pretty charming and hilarious. &quot;Let's go to the field. Giant cricket!&quot;<br><br>The actual game play is simple at a glance, with simple controls and very little in the way of mechanics to get used to. There's actually a lot more going on behind the scenes, though, with plenty in the way of stats and conditions and how they're implemented not needing to be directly communicated to the player.<br><br>The pacing is somewhat slow at first, but you can do a lot to customize the speed of your character's attacks and whatnot to make things more to your liking. I'm pretty boring in how I play, so I generally just pump all of my stat points into strength and constitution, but you can really experiment with your character's stats and equipment to the point that replayability is highly encouraged.<br><br>Don't go in expecting a technical marvel, in either case. There's no PhysX here. The overall feel of the game is akin to what you might play on a Game Gear or an NES, even though - as I touched on before - there's a lot more going on behind the scenes that effects game play in a meaningful way.<br><br>Level design has a ton of variety to it (with my favorite being a dark cave level so far). Some levels have a lot of verticality to them, while others are almost maze-like. Others have sub-areas to explore, and some of them even include boss battles that do a lot to mix things up a bit more. The enemy placement complements the level design really well, too, which is always nice to see.<br><br>Overall, if you want a nice, inexpensive game with a ton of replay value, I can't recommend Just a Cleric enough.<br><br><br>Full disclaimer: I assisted in testing Just a Cleric prior to its release, even prior to its listing on Greenlight. I also provided light feedback with respect to content and usability. (I also assisted with testing and feedback on past DXF Games projects.) I also received free pre-release builds of the game outside of Steam, and I received a free code for redemption on Steam to test Steam-exclusive functionality.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23087857', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23087857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23087857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23087857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23087857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23087857', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23087857_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23087857_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">8 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23109584\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"71816102\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/272f92f0e53a8cfe5964eb16c8c77f5214d21327.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/272f92f0e53a8cfe5964eb16c8c77f5214d21327.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/272f92f0e53a8cfe5964eb16c8c77f5214d21327_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71816102\">Doyledeth<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/games\/?tab=all\">171 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032081830\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst off let me start off by saying the Developer is a really nice guy and is there to help in any way possible. He's very vocal with the community and has fixed some things that really irked me when I first made this review. My review was initially negative, but the developer fixed the issues as fast as you can say, &quot;Just a Cleric.&quot; So don't be afraid to contact him or post issues on the forum. I will leave my original review intact, but my new review is as follows...<br><br>PROS<br><br>-Great and hilarious original soundtrack filled with crunchy bass lines and HILARIOUS lyrics. <br><br>-New game plus feature that introduces cool new features that I don't want to spoil for you. HINT: Jump around EVERYWHERE when in new game plus. Trust me, you won't regret it. <br><br>-Cool, but very basic leveling\/upgrade system. This is both a con and a positive. I'll explain the cons of this in the con section below. You can upgrade your gear to plus 4 and after that you can get your items blessed for even more power, which is a very cool feature. <br><br>- Once you get past the difficulty curve, the game is a joy to play. I ended up playing for a few hours last night and didn't realize the time flew by so fast.<br><br>-NPCs are hilarious as well and blend in with the cutesy atmosphere. <br><br>CONS<br><br>-No place where you can farm for money or gear between missions. The gear can be pretty expensive. <br><br>-The font is pretty atrocious, but hang in there and you'll adapt to it<br><br>-Sometimes the Cleric has a hard time listening to your button commands.Only seems to be this way when you're under attack. The overall feel of the controls is avergae at best. <br><br>-Lacks a skill upgrade system. The stats DO affect your powers, but I would have found leveling more enjoyable with something else to invest points in, like maybe passive skills that increase run speed, Attack speed etc, but the leveling system is still solid.<br><br>-Sometimes difficulty can seem more artifical than fair. That's when you gotta outwit the opponent by using the ladders to destroy them. Trust me, it's a godsend, especially against the Dragon. <br><br>If you end up buying this game I HIGHLY recommend focusing on mostly the Faith stat because you're gonna get annoyed by sitting there for at least  a minute or two to heal your magic points in order to heal your hp, only to go fight a Boss that drains your HP like you're wearing a styrafoam armor set. I'm not saying ignore all the other stats, but make sure you have a healthy amount of faith. Also, the SPEAR type weapons are the absolute best weapons to use. <br><br>After all my frustrations with the first few hours of playtime, I finally got the hang of it and now I'm having a blast with it. I'm actually destroying New Game plus at the moment with no issues. I recommend this game if you're into Metroidvania style games and also want a good laugh in the process due to the amazing music. <br><br>Give it a shot! It's cheap! :)<br><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Great music, very funny lyrics and that bass line is crunchy<br><br>-Decent character upgrade\/leveling system.  (there are cons for this I'll explain later)<br><br>-The townsfolk are funny, The humor in this game is top notch.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>-Lack of farming\/grinding for levels or items. This is a problem because of.....<br><br>-Expensive Gear. This wouldn't be a problem if we were able to farm  to buy said gear and upgrade the gear more frequently.<br><br>-Steep learning curve. I'm just going to say. I HATE the Werewolves and the Dragon. Never ending infuriation.  It seems that the enemies tend to hit you first if you dont have a spear. <br><br>-No checkpoint system. Dying over and over and over again would be acceptable if we didn't have to go through the same stage over and over and over and over and over again, wasting valuable time.  Checkpoints NEED to be implemented to lessen the frustration. I would be able to deal with it if the game had such a system. <br><br>-Difficulty seems more artifical than fair. Trust me, I LOVE difficult games if it's implemented correctly. Here it just seems artifically difficult,<br><br>If you end up buying this game I HIGHLY recomend focusing on mostly the Faith stat because you're gonna get annoyed by sitting there for at least  a minute or two to heal your magic points in order to heal your hp, only to go fight a Boss that drains your HP like you're wearing a styrafoam armor set. <br><br>This game has ALOT of potential and the developer immediately responds to issues and fixes bugs promptly. At best, this game feels alot like an early access title. As much as I like the developer, I can't recommend this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23109584', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23109584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23109584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23109584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23109584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23109584', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23109584_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23109584_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23136560\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toeli\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"85130890\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/670d7d67d8ef8fab4114b77ecb8a3d8b03f43a54.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/670d7d67d8ef8fab4114b77ecb8a3d8b03f43a54.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/670d7d67d8ef8fab4114b77ecb8a3d8b03f43a54_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toeli\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85130890\">Toeli<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toeli\/games\/?tab=all\">151 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toeli\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toeli\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI\u00b4ve had the possibility to talk to the Developer a lot and I\u00b4ve been keeping an eye on this game since it was put on Greenlight. So far, this game has been one of the best Indie-Releases I\u00b4ve played to date, but let me start from the beginning.<br><br>The Developer is a great guy who already developed a few other games, JAC being the first one who was put on Steam Greenlight. I don\u00b4t know where I met him anymore (I think it was somewhere in the Off-Topic-Hell here in the Steam-Community), but he told me about JAC and after I saw the Greenlight Trailer I immediately knew that this game had potential. After two or three weeks he uploaded a Demo for everyone to try. This Demo was the moment I was really convinced to buy this game. The humor in this game is so awesome, almost every NPC is admireable and throws out one gag after another. Situational Humor, funny Tooltips... The Demo alone already entertained me more than most games in terms of humor. <br><br>Gameplay-wise this game reminds me of the old Castlevania Games, mixed with a weird blend of different games. The Cleric Class from the Old-School-RPG\u00b4s (take Baldur\u00b4s Gate from BioWare as an example), the deadly traps you know from Dungeon Crawlers and Side-Scrollers (like Castlevania), a lovely Pixel-Art-Graphicstyle (which only adds to the charme of the game, I couldn\u00b4t imagine this game being 3D or whatever), everything in this game kinda matches. <br><br>AND the soundtrack was selfmade. It\u00b4s so god damn awesome, I\u00b4d recommend this game solely for the soundtrack already, but that\u00b4s not the point here.<br><br>You start off as a Cleric who never gets to do something (yes, you\u00b4ve read it correct, you never get to do something).<br>His Party-Members are so strong, he just stands somewhere in the back, drinking Milk, while his Party Members have been bringing wrecking carnage upon the enemies. One day though, he has to take a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 after a fight (because he drank too much Milk) and while he is gone, his friends are being attacked by a Dragon. Once the Cleric returns, all of his friends are dead. The Cleric swears to take revenge for his fallen comrades and pillages the dead bodies for loot. (Oh yes, that is macabre, isn\u00b4t it?). Actually, this is the first important step in the game. You are able to get the entire Gear during the game anyways, but this choice will influence your early game. You better not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this up. Choose wisely.<br><br>The game itself is simple but challenging. Don\u00b4t expect a game that will change the entire RPG-Genre. <br>Most of the time your objective is to reach a certain spot of the map, collect a certain item, destroy a certain item, find a certain NPC or protect a certain NPC. Every few missions though, a mighty boss appears and you have to figure out how to beat him. Memorize the attack patterns and exploit the weak spots. The game itself really is challenging sometimes, you will definetly find yourself repeating some stages over and over again, but the Developer really listens to Feedback, he even decreased the challenge in the first playthrough, so that the game doesn\u00b4t get too tough. <br><br>Once you\u00b4ve beat it for the first time, you\u00b4re going to find yourself in the New Game +, where the enemies have been reworked completely, delivering a harder challenge now, spitting at the poor Cleric with lots of debuffs, new attack patterns etc. Especially the Bosses are a REAL challenge now. And as if this wasn\u00b4t enough, there\u00b4s even a <b>Super Boss <\/b> to beat. (But I haven\u00b4t reached him yet, so I can\u00b4t really say much about him).<br><br>Summa Summarum: If you\u00b4re searching for a game that is able to entertain you, this game will definetly be able to fit your needs. Challenging Gameplay, the best Humor in a game I\u00b4ve seen for a long time and the charming Pixel-Graphic make this game what it is. The Developer is really listening to the Feedback, looking for opinions and ideas on how to improve his game. Hardly I\u00b4ve seen a Dev that has been so passionate (might have something to do with the fact that he\u00b4s been working on this game in his free time during the last two years. You can see the Heartblood he pumped into this title). I\u00b4ve spent 4\u20ac on it, and that\u00b4s far less than what I\u00b4ve spent on some &quot;AAA-Games&quot; who have been disappointing, to say the least. If you\u00b4re even slightly interested in such games, consider to pick this up. You won\u00b4t regret it.<br><br><br><u>EDIT:<\/u> The Developer added an expansion. A noteable thing among many others is the &quot;grind&quot; level that allows you to increase your cleric\u00b4s powers in order to make the whole game a tad easier. It\u00b4s still challenging.<br><br><br>The whole expansion turned out awesome, so... if you have some spare money and search for great entertainment, consider to grab this game. Great one, indeed\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23136560', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23136560' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23136560\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23136560' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23136560\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23136560', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23136560_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23136560_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23153497\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043768113\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83502385\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a66a0fd1edef0899c855e0f716c7f49abb24c7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a66a0fd1edef0899c855e0f716c7f49abb24c7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a66a0fd1edef0899c855e0f716c7f49abb24c7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043768113\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83502385\">Yoritoshi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043768113\/games\/?tab=all\">159 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043768113\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043768113\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">21.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a Cleric out to kill a dragon in revenge for his fallen allies, you start out in a small hub where you can buy and upgrade equipment before leaving to perform certain tasks on a series of missions. Some levels are small and require you to beat the nearby enemies in some way, while others are more maze-like and feature optional paths and secrets. There's also a New Game+ mode that has incentives such as stronger enemies, hidden powerups and some different items to obtain.<br><br>The controls are simple enough, with your character being able to equip a variety of weapon types and to learn a series of spells. You can choose what stats to increase when levelling up and even reset them for a small price if needed. I've found that increasing Faith is quite useful so you can recharge MP quickly and use the healing spell any time you find yourself in trouble.<br><br>Some missions are rather difficult, but it shouldn't take long for any action game fan to get the hang of it. Get good, will ya? Most of the time you can turtle out of battles, even some bosses, to heal yourself and there's a rather cheesy fire shield spell that trivializes several areas. As a wise man once said: &quot;Ninjas can't catch you if you're on fire&quot;.<br><br>The low-res pixel art gives a cute cartoony feel to it, not unlike Environmental Station Alpha. Plus, it has a silly soundtrack with corny lyrics.<br><br>All in all, the game feels like an improvement to one of the dev's more well known games, Hasslevania. Frankly, the ongoing Hasslevania 2 project, as I remember it from the betas, would feel more unrefined and slow-paced than this one. Just A Cleric is good fun, lasts for a couple of hours and is well worth the small asking price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23153497', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23153497' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23153497\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23153497' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23153497\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23153497', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23153497_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23153497_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29769956\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"88930667\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/11fe5cfb2d905388f89e3863f406d2ea470ead10.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/11fe5cfb2d905388f89e3863f406d2ea470ead10.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/11fe5cfb2d905388f89e3863f406d2ea470ead10_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/\" data-miniprofile=\"88930667\">\\\/\/\\|&gt;0R\u20a9\/\\\\\/\u20ac Sasha \u30b5\u30fc<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/games\/?tab=all\">1,960 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/recommended\/\">64 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Antichristian_Industrialist\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe game is hard, it's Nintendo hard. It's not unfair but it is challenging for those retro gamers out there. Even if it gets frustrating at time. There are tons of secrets throughout and multiple ways to play the game as you can choose different character classes at the start of the game. The controls never feel stiff and move perfectly with a keyboard or gamepad. Although with this type of game I strongly recommend playing with a gamepad instead. The music is fun and hilarious. Instead of some retro bit music or synth soundtrack you are treated to an actual rock band doing the music and lyrics. In a way the soundtrack sort of reminds me that of Home Movies if anybody recalled that show. The game's pricing is really not that much even at full price it's an enjoyable experience. My only complaint about the game is that there is no Steam Cloud.

The writing\/humour in these quests is fantastic and definitely the best part of the game (even the soundtrack is both hilarious and catchy).<br><br>The controls are pretty standard (move, attack, jump and spell) and the combat works fine (although the hitboxes are a little wonky). The game also has four different stats you can level depending on your playstyle. Personally I prefer Faith since you can spam healing\/defensive spells more often if you level that. Now that DOES lead to a balancing problem since you can always just hide and heal up if you're low on a quest, but I won't complain since some of the levels can be pretty tough. <br><br>My only major problem is that you can't grind between quests so if you're ever stuck there's not much you can do besides tough it out. This shouldn't be an issue once you've learned the game (or abuse the healing trick) but it would be nice if you could get some extra money and materials between quests.<br><br>Overall Just a Cleric is a fun (but simple) indie game that's definitely worth the price. Thumbs up to the dev who's very involved in the community and always listens to player feedback. Keep it up!<br><br><b>EDIT: My video on Just a Cleric.<\/b><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aJ7aFcF6xVE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aJ7aFcF6xVE<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23181884', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23181884' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23181884\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23181884' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23181884\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23181884', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23181884_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23181884_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25664225\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"99661914\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b0b6ebb10876a07cb87a6ab8323b48dbc6c6ef3a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b0b6ebb10876a07cb87a6ab8323b48dbc6c6ef3a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b0b6ebb10876a07cb87a6ab8323b48dbc6c6ef3a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/\" data-miniprofile=\"99661914\">Cube of Bees<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/games\/?tab=all\">72 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/recommended\/\">27 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059927642\/recommended\/467330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">I enjoyed this game!<\/div><br>It has a bunch of content for a low price point. It just has one major flaw that could turn you off from it. <br><br>The music is <u>HORRIBLE!!!<\/u> Actually, let me clearify. The instrumentals are ok and sound decent but the lyrics are what make you want to mute the game. It's SO bad I spam the B button on the start up, as if my life depends on it, trying desprately to avoid listening to the ear bleeding intro music. Not only that but many other areas in the game have terrible music too. And again it's not the instrumentals, it's the lyrics. <br><br>When you're in the town, the lyrics go &quot;TOOOOWWWNNNN... IN TOOOOOWWWWNNNN!!!&quot;<br>When you're in the shop the lyrics go &quot;Buy the stuff... buy the stuff...&quot;<br>When you're fighting a boss the lyrics go &quot;Big boss!... Big boss!...&quot;<br>When you're on a certain quest the lyrics go &quot;M, I, L, K, that's what we drink all day!&quot;<br><br>By the sixth playthrough I ended up muting the game completely. I couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br><u>Everything else with the game is good, it just needs some more tweaking.<\/u><br><br>Like collecting the eyes for special equipment. The dungeon isn't much fun when you can't use the items you found in the game and are forced to get lucky with the random drops. Also the rewards for demon eyes are all useless. I never used a single item from that shop; they are just so bad.<br><br>I never used the set armour guy either. I think the only set I got was the resist magic one and at the time I didn't have storage so I sold it all. After five more playthroughs I only ever got a piece of a set I think.<br><br>One or two of the quests got annoying after several playthroughs. All of the dark areas were not very fun to play but the one that takes the cake is that quest with the wealthy guy. I think it's completely random but you have to choose four doors correctly and if you pick the wrong one you lose and do not get a special item. I end up reseting the game over and over because he gives you a really good item. So it'll take 15 - 30 minutes to complete this quest and it just seems like you need to get lucky.<br><br>Finally, I found some glitches by accident. I somehow duplicated my weapon when I put it in storage and took it out. It was a special weapon and fully upgraded so when I sold it I was rich. I also killed the secret boss once with the stunness gloves. As he flys to a different corner and you have those gloves and a fast enough weapon you can hit him for all his life and he'll barely move.<br><br>Everything else with the game is really good. I loved the Sprite and item graphics, and all the little unique items you find. The sound effects are really nice. Most of the levels are fun and filled with variety. I like the fact there's a demon eye shop even though I didn't use it. The secret boss was fun too. I also loved that there is a hardcore mode! And even the music, when it was lacking lyrics, it was good. For example the church sounded like a church.<br><br><u>I recommend getting this game.

And while every mission has a set number of enemies and you can't grind any exp. or money, I haven't gotten to a point where a mission becomes impossible, mostly because there's a lot of options to work with.<br><br>There are 4 stats you can upgrade as you level up, strength to deal more damage, faith to power up your spells and recharge your spell meter faster, constitution to upgrade your defense and hit points, and luck to get better loot from chests and drops from enemies meaning there's a lot of room for strategy, say you are not getting any good armor? you can focus on leveling up CON so you can resist more damage or FAI to heal faster, or you've gotten so far and still haven't gotten a new weapon? you can upgrade your starting weapon with the blacksmith using materials and money you find lying around, and in case you suddenly get a great piece of armor and feel like you can redeem some of your CON points in favor of STR, well you can do so at anytime as long as you have $25 to spare for a stat reset potion at the wizard store.<br><br>Controls are really smooth and responsive, although there's a couple of minor issues with the fighting mechanic, mostly enemies with patterns that can overpower you depending on the weapon you are using, such as trying to poke a fast flying bird with your spear or fighting a boss with a powerful yet slow weapon like an axe or a short ranged weapon makes you really prone to get hit in the process, this however is only an issue if are not carrying more than one weapon type in your inventory.<br><br>Speaking of inventory that's another downside I have with the game, on the plus side there's TONS of gear and weapons you can get, yet you have so little space in your inventory to keep most of them, you'll end up selling or on the worst case scenario dropping great equipment you get might get in the middle of a mission because you won't have enough room, kinda wish there was a way to store some equipment.<br><br>The game has a lot of humor, mostly crude which I understand could be not everyone's cup of tea, I myself find it appealing and think it goes along really well with the cutesy 8-bit graphics, the humor can be appreciated in the soundtrack as well. which in contrast to the 8-bit graphics, it's actually instrumental and even lyrical, mostly on the comical side.<br><br>Just a Cleric is a clear example of a game you can pick up at anytime and have a blast, the replayability is high with the new game+ and if you are the kind that enjoys self-imposed challenges this game is great for it, or you can try the hardest in-game challenge &quot;hardcore mode&quot; which is bound to give achievement hunters a run for their money.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24894300', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24894300' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24894300\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24894300' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24894300\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24894300', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24894300_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24894300_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/467330\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 23 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["23087857","23109584","23136560","23153497","29769956","23181884","25664225","25558827","25965667","23175729"]}
