Due to a plane crash in the Bermuda Triangle, your character finds themselves stranded on a tropical island so obviously your aim is to find a way off it. In order to do that, you must explore the island in search of food, other stranded people and build yourself a ship capable of getting out of there! <br><br>The gameplay in Lost Sea is played from top down view and has very basic hack and slash combat elements. Your character\u2019s main attack is simply a swing of the sword, but you will come across other pieces of equipment too such as a shotgun of sorts. You will be fighting against pretty much what you would expect on a tropical island, wild animals, huge giants, dinosaurs, crazy island dwellers, and more. Due to the game\u2019s very basic combat system, you find yourself having to dodge more and carefully time your attacks on foes as you will soon find out, death in permanent here. If you die, you start right at the beginning again; it oh so annoying but also part and parcel of roguelike games. I think the perma death feature wouldn\u2019t be so bad if they allowed you to keep all of your well earned abilities and skills that you have gathered up to that point but alas we can't have it all. <br><br>On the subject of these skills and abilities, any enemies you kill will drop coins and experience points; back at your home base you can trade these in for new skills and abilities which will aid you on your exploration of the island. These can range from straight up health increases, or allowing you to have more people in your party of explorers. I personally really liked the skill and ability system in Lost Sea, but it let me down a tad when I found out they don\u2019t carry over between runs - it almost makes them feel a little pointless at times. <br><br>Other part\u2019s of Lost Sea\u2019s gameplay really irk me a tad too; as you progress through the game, you will soon be heavily reliant on the rest of your team mates; these bring along their own unique traits to your party such as being able to dig up hidden treasure, or unlock locked away items in chests - so they become pretty key to your progression. Sadly they have a very poor AI programmed into them. When you get attacked by enemies they will just freeze where they stand and do nothing; common sense would make them run away and hide, but they just knuckle down and do nothing until the danger has passed, this came across as a very poor design to me. Another issue with the AI is that they are so prone to getting stuck behind objects and pieces of the world that you will spend a good portion of time backtracking in order to free them from that hidden wall they are constantly running into.  <br><br>Lost Sea\u2019s bright and colourful art style gives the game a playful look to it; one that I particularly enjoyed, the character models look well detailed and well animated with the enemies looking impressive too. The game\u2019s environments are definitely well worth exploring if only for the graphical fidelity on them. I would have liked to see some voice acting throughout as the sound effects are a little on the low quality side but nothing overly bad at the end of the day. <br><br>This game is difficult, no question about it. It is almost as forgiving as Dark Souls when it comes down to instant deaths, as monsters will literally jump out of trees, charge at you and you\u2019ll die. This happens more times than I can count on one hand and does leave you feeling a little deflated in terms of wanting to pick up the controller again and jumping straight into another run, because quite simply, you are starting the game all over again. Yes you do unlock a portal like system in order to teleport to where you died, but your character is so under leveled and poorly equipped that you would just end up dying even quicker than before. <br><br>This game has tons of content, and I found it hard to actually find someone who had managed to complete the game even now 10 days after it\u2019s release. I am not sure it would have much replayability as the actual story and plot does not change from run to run, and to be honest I would be more than happy to get one complete run out of this title, because it is so tough in the first place. <br><br>Apart from the issues mentioned with the buggy AI of the other team members, Lost Sea is a pretty technically sound release. The game is definitely going to require you to pick up your controller over keyboard and mouse though.  I feel Lost Sea would have really benefited from a multiplayer mode too; after all everything is better with friends, and this would of been no different. A co-op mode for this game would be absolutely awesome and one that I hope they can add in the future. <br><br>Overall Lost Sea is an OK release. There is nothing absolutely mind boggling good coming out of it, but it doesn\u2019t do too much wrong either. The permadeath element definately needs changing to make the gameplay a little more forgiving and to cut down on the amount of rage quits this game induces on its players though. The game\u2019s full price of \u00a310.99 is well marked for a game of this quality and amount of content on offer. <br><br><b><u> Tom's Score Card<\/u><\/b><br>1) Stay away<br>2) Not Recommended<br>3) Only recommended when on sale<br><b><u>4) Recommended<\/u><\/b><br>5) Highly recommended<br>6) This is a must play<br><br>If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

You meet a scientist who explains to you that, by finding magical tablets, you can travel from island to island and hopefully escape.<br><br>So\u2026 You do just that.<br><br>.Gameplay. <br>The game can be played with either keyboard and mouse or gamepad.  I used the latter simply because it was far more comfortable than the keyboard setup.<br><br>You begin each playthrough by selecting 1 of 8 characters. These are merely aesthetic and have no bearing on how the game will play.<br><br>Then, you hop onto your ship and sail to the first island in the first zone (unless you have warp, but more on that later). Islands have a varying enemy difficulty from easy-hard. On them, you\u2019ll hunt down tablets, which can be found at random, so that you can move from island to island. One tablet means you can move to the next islands in the chain of islands. <br><br>You\u2019ll continue doing this until you reach the large island at the end\u2014the one with a huge skull and dark, ominous clouds hanging above it\u2014where you\u2019ll face a boss. <br><br>If you die, you\u2019re given a statistical breakdown of what you\u2019ve done in game:<br><br>Regions Discovered<br>XP<br>Gold<br>Deaths<br>Crew Recruited<br>Enemies Killed<br>Items Used<br>Time Played<br><br>Then, you choose a character and dive into the game with a fraction of the resources you picked up during your last run and none of the skills you\u2019ve unlocked.<br><br>Rinse, wash, and repeat.<br><br>Once you clear a zone you unlock the ability to Warp between them freely. There are four in total, not counting the starting area. <br><br>The islands also contain collectable treasures and pickups with a variety of effects. These pickups can heal you, add more stats, and the like. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no telling what items do until you use them. Once or twice I\u2019ve tried a mysterious potion that miraculously drained all of my HP or some other awful thing that put me at a horrible disadvantage when fighting the foes on the island.<br><br>.Atmosphere.<br>The islands are rather uniform in appearance, despite their procedural generation. Every area has its own biome, which is visually interesting at the very beginning of the chain of islands, but quickly loses its luster. <br><br>The music is nothing special, just a repeating loop that gets lost in the background.<br><br>.Longevity.<br>There are plenty of upgrades to unlock and treasures to discover while you travel the isles. Dying results in you losing all of those upgrades, but the amount of resources retained after you die is pretty generous, so you should have no problem regaining the skills you lost.<br><br>There isn\u2019t a story so you could go on playing indefinitely as long as you\u2019re willing. <br><br>.Pros and Cons.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Boss fights are fun in the classic learn-the-attack-pattern-in-order-to-win style.<br><\/li><li> A good mix of upgrades available for combat and exploration.<br><\/li><li> Crew members have different skills, which allow for some strategizing.<br><br><\/li><li> Character selection has no bearing on gameplay.<br><\/li><li> Procedural generation doesn\u2019t create any particularly different levels.<br><\/li><li> Your crew members aren\u2019t very intelligent. They will cower and take damage from both enemies and yourself (yes, friendly fire is a thing) and will oftentimes die. They won\u2019t fight back and they won\u2019t try to get away. <br><\/li><li> It takes quite a bit of grinding to be able to afford new skills.

With the help of other stranded crew members that you find on your path and upgrades you can purchase at each island's dock , your quest is to navigate through the islands up until you reach the final one which allows you to enter a portal that leads you to an unknown place, presumably somewhere safe.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Gameplay.<\/b><\/div><br>When you first start your journey or everytime you have to restart due to death , you can select from 8 Equally Powered Characters. There are five male and three female Heroes to choose from.<br><br>The tutorial island does a decent job at covering all the basic knowledge you will need throughout your journey. You will meet a Self-proclaimed scientist , that will explain to you your situation and how to deal with it. As soon as you are done with the tutorial island the game sends you straight to the next one. <br><br>There are 5 Sections in total. Each section has its own biome theme , monsters and a boss fight on the last island. Beating that boss permanently unlocks you the next section. (Meaning if you die after reaching a new section, you can start at it's beginning as opposed to the very first Tropical Island you start the game at, if you choose to.)<br><br>The idea of the game is to search these procedually generated islands for new crew members, items that will aid you, Monsters for their EXP-Currency drops (Which are needed for Player based upgrades), Crates and Barrels for their Coin drops (Which are needed for Ship Related Upgrades) and mainly for Navigation Tablets which are the only way for you to move forward to the next island. Once you require those tablets , you ought to bring them back to the island's dock and then if you decide you are finished with that island you can move to the next ones.<br><br><b>Something that will be noticeable throughout the game and something I didnt see many reviewers mention correctly (In my opinion)<\/b> is the Difficulty Curve. While the game has some Pseudo-Difficulty elements which upset me at first , but then I realised there weren't that many (Talking about charging Lizards coming out of nearby harmless-looking coin boxes and Crew Members you're about to rescue suddently turning into monsters that attack you as soon as you get close). It actually came to me by surprise how the game doesn't want to take you by the hand showing you every little way to deal with things easier and that it expects you to learn it by experience by yourself. No Pickup\/Item you find in the game ever has description. You have to judge what the Item does based on it's icon and use it atleast once to be sure of what it does. Attack patterns of monsters you've encountered for the first time are not visible from afar. Sometimes you have to get close and personal to learn what they do and although that experience goes away as soon as you learn the pattern , I think its really cool.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Game Design and Controlls.<\/b><\/div><br>The monster design while being basic has a nice variety, making the difficulty curve extremely noticeable for players. Each section you move forward you will find new monsters and revamped versions of old ones with more challenging attack patterns. <br><br>While it can be said that the monster design is pleasing, the same thing cannot be said for the Boss Battle(s). Each boss battle features the same boss. An angry pirate captain that each time you meet on a later section has a new trick under his sleeve. While it's not a rule that all games should have a variety of bosses and can't have an upgraded version of the same one , this particular gameplay feature could've been executed much better. <br><br>Visually the game looks gorgeous for it's theme. Everything seems in-place, the colours blend in beautifully , each biome is its own place and thats how it should feel. Something I found really interesting was that the game actually has a day-night cycle that has zero impact in the game whatsoever ,but its a feature meant only for visual purposes and I think its great. <br><br>The object breaking\/coin collecting animations and sounds are satisfying. The attack and skill animations could be better but its overally fine. When it comes to sounds mainly, I would say that everything is well made. Soundtracks may be decent at most but do a great job at blending in with the visual theme. The only thing I absolutely despised was the Grunts the Boss made, it felt really out of place. Other than that the characters themselves could use some more grunt sounds. (I use the word Grunt here because there is no voice over dialogue this game.)<br><br>I can say that the Monster AI is fairly well made too , nothing is really that exploitable but the Crew Member AI can sometimes be really frustrating. Much more noteably later on in the game when through upgrades you will be controlling up to 4 Crew members in total. You will find yourself moving around the island with them getting stuck prety often.<br><br>Another feature that was lacking that bothered me alot was the fact that you cannot recruit new crew members without manually opening up a slot. The game should offer the ability to either switch-out immediately with another selected crew member or the ability to just send the new-found crew members at the dock without using them at all. It would also be great if we had a bonus for rescuing more\/all\/any crew members.<br><br>Last but not least. <b> A very important matter\/issue <\/b> with the game is the Controls. I've played the game with a <u>Controller<\/u> and it played <b>absolutely lovely<\/b>. <b><u>Although<\/u><\/b>. <u>Keyboard<\/u> users have issues when it comes to camera control. The game's keyboard default keys allow you to rotate your camera with K and L, each representing a direction and M to refocus the camera back to the center. As far as I've noticed the keybindings cannot be changed in the ingame settings and can be only changed through editing gamefiles , ontop of that there is no speed adjustment for how fast\/slow the camera rotates and trust me when I say its <b>significantly slower<\/b> than the controller rotation speed.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>The Pros.<\/b><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>A Good variety of upgrades , powerups and gameplay elements.<br>    <\/li><li>Visual Theme and soundtracks blend well and are really pleasant.<br>    <\/li><li>Game rewards you for managing your resources smartly.   <br>    <\/li><li>Full Controller Support.<br>    <\/li><li>46 Achievements For You To Hunt For.<br>    <\/li><li>Steam Trading Cards.<\/li><\/ul> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>The Cons.<\/b><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Gameplay can be repetitive.<br>    <\/li><li>Being Unable To sprint while holding a Navigation Tablet makes the gameplay sometimes feel slow.<br>    <\/li><li>A lot of Backtracking.<br>    <\/li><li>Crew AI can be frustrating at times.<br>    <\/li><li>Keyboard Controls feel wacky<br>    <\/li><li>Boss fights while having challenging aspects its essentially a revamped version of the old boss.<\/li><\/ul> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> Conclussion. <\/b><\/div><br>If you are a fan of rogue-likes and you would like to see a different base idea of gameplay the Lost Sea will most likely be a game for you. The game has its own flaws but in my opinion is an overall well made game that could use some improvements here and there. Keep in mind that the game currently plays best on Controllers. Hopefully my review will help you out on deciding whether you want to buy the game or not.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25060315', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25060315' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25060315\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25060315' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25060315\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25060315', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25060315_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25060315_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25407266\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"85828157\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85828157\">TheDragonsNiche<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/games\/?tab=all\">596 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/recommended\/\">47 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/recommended\/334280\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Lost Sea for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>     <i>Lost Sea<\/i> is a procedurally generated action, adventure, rouge-like game. In Lost sea, the primary objective is to find these secret, hidden items called tablets. Tablets are artifacts scattered across every single island that you must collect and bring back to the ship in order to clear each level. The problem becomes, at the start of the game, you are unable to unlock any ship upgrades that would reveal up to three hidden tablets on your island map, as a result, you have to search through most of the island until a light in the upper left-hand corner of your screen illuminates through your lantern showing you how close the next tablet is. It is not until later on in which you unlock two ship upgrades that you purchase through obtaining gold located in wooden boxes that you destroy through your currently equipped weapon. <br><br>     These two upgrades are respectfully called crow\u2019s nest and charts. Crow\u2019s nest shows you exactly where a random tablet is hidden on your map which can be brought up through pressing start. The other ship upgrades revealing multiple destinations up to three tablets at a time is charts II. The first upgrade to charts \u201censures multiple tablets don\u2019t roll the same sailing distance.\u201d<br><br><i>PC release date: July 5, 2016<br>Review originally wrote: September 8, 2016<br>Published and developed by Eastasiasoft Limited<\/i><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Prelude<\/div>     In the beginning, you play as one of eight different survivors as you uncover your purpose and reason for waking up on an abandoned island. The story uses the classic adventure-based dialogue of early adventure-based games for the PC. The game reminds me of <i>Tales of Monkey Island<\/i> despite the game having no resemblance or relation to the former. I used to watch my brother play the point-and-click based <i>Tales of Monkey Island<\/i> series on console long ago by Telltale games. Now, Telltale focuses primarily on story-based movie-driven plots, climax, exposition and character based interactions that give the gamer influence over how the movie-driven story will pan out. <br><br>     It is rare now to see Telltale re-focus on their beginnings which were some of the earlier point-and-click adventure games that made the genre rise and become so popular among people of all ages. In contrast, in Lost Sea, you wake up as a survivor that has been knocked out, face down in the sand. You awake to experience amnesia for a short while until your memory begins to come back. Once your memory sets in, you find a strange man who is actually a scientist that has lost his assistant. He tells you how you got to the island. There were rough seas in which the ship spun out of control and washed you upshore. Now, after this, you team up with the scientist and help him out as you gather more crew members within your party. <br><br>     You are limited to only one crew member to follow you and tag along at the beginning until unlocking the leadership tiers found within the ship\u2019s workshop under player upgrades. You use your gold you collect from destroying boxes in order to purchase these, whereas, ship upgrades are bought through a currency you use once defeating enemies, dealing hit points to them. <br><br><b>Features<\/b><br>     <div class=\"bb_h1\">Procedurally Generated\/ Small RPG-Esque Upgrade System &amp; Enemy Variation<br>\nProcedurally Generated Action, Adventure<\/div><br>     <b>Short History Based on Joel Lee\u2019s Make Use of Article Titled \u201cHow Procedural Generation Took Over the Gaming Industry&quot;<\/b><br><br>     According to this article by Joel Lee, procedural generation is best defined in gaming as \u201cthe creation of content according to the parameters of an algorithm rather than through manual creation by hand. In even simpler terms, it\u2019s the process of creating content using nothing but code.&quot; Early examples of games that he cites are: <i>Rogue<\/i> (1980), <i>Tetris<\/i> (1984), <i>Diablo<\/i> (1996), and <i>Minecraft<\/i> (2009). Today, procedurally generated usually means that there is some degree of infinite replayability, an infinite world in which no level is ever the same a second time through. According to this conception, once you go back and replay levels, all enemies you previously faced will randomly spawn on the map based on a random numerically generated enemy count that picks and chooses which enemies you will face. There is permadeath in which you lose all your starting player and ship upgrades as well as your weapon and progress across all the islands you have cleared. When facing enemies, you have to be careful to avoid enemies in large packs such as the Neanderthal enemy type. <br><br>    <b> Small RPG-Esque Upgrade System<\/b><br><br>     I already stated that Lost Sea includes only elements in a role-playing game that are essential which is a combination of hack-and-slash when defeating enemies closely related to the action role-playing genre and only necessary upgrades which you encounter through very short-based role-playing games. It only includes the quintessential features to make the game unique without overshadowing, overcrowding it with the other bells and whistles that longer role-playing games have within the twenty plus hours\u2019 range.<br><br>     <b>Enemy Variation<\/b><br>     So far, I have only seen the following enemies: Neanderthals, leaping purple frogs that go into a daze after they jump mid-air eventually returning to the ground, Piranha plants and ducks.

Sotto la recensione in italiano.    <\/u><br><br><br>Lost Sea is an indie action-adventure game with roguelike and survival elements, in a 360 degree rotatable 3D environment, characterized by colorful graphics and some innovative features for the genre.<br>Set on various islands in the Bermuda Triangle, after a storm has wrecked us in this place, we will have to recruit many survivors and survive a few bosses, one for each stage (jungle, desert, swamp and snow), trying to escape from the islands Bermuda.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros <\/div> <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>steam cloud, achievements, and trading cards<br><\/li><li>Many languages supported<br><\/li><li>full controller support<br><\/li><li>steam os, linux and mac support<br><\/li><li>managable system requirements<br><\/li><li>islands created with procedural generation<br><\/li><li>colorful graphics and good music <br><\/li><li>price equal to quality <br><\/li><li>helpful tutorial<br><\/li><li>suitable for all ages <br><\/li><li>simple, relaxing and immediate <br><\/li><li>some interesting ideas here and there<br><\/li><li>good number of collectible treasures<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons <\/div> <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>permadeath, currently no option to save<br><\/li><li>gameplay can be repetitive at times<br><\/li><li>crew is not really helpful<br><\/li><li>difficulty poorly balanced<br><\/li><li>backtracking exists and is quite annoying<br><\/li><li>poor a-i, no minimap<br><\/li><li>combat is shallow<br><\/li><li>plot is barely touched<br><\/li><li>little variety of enemies,a lot of grinding<br><\/li><li>can be uncomfortable with keyboard<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Notes: <\/div> <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>there is a DRM-free version of the game on other platforms<\/li><\/ul><br><br>In conclusion Lost Sea is fun if played in small doses; graphics and sound are nice.<br>Longevity is sufficient thanks to the four biomes, but the game in the long run can get repetitive.<br>The main character is equipped with machetes and possesses some skills unlockable with continued of the adventure (such as dodging, running ...), but the whole thing is not very deep.<br>Our crew not help us in the fighting, and has a poor AI that simply pick locks or repair bridges; outside the tutorial is not present any stories that can entertain until the end of the game.<br>There is no mini-map, which is unnerving for having to open constantly the general map, and it's annoying even having to retrace your steps, each time collected the artifact that allows us to change the island.<br>It also lacks the save, that if you do not have enough time is frustrating, because it forces you to face every biome and boss without being able to resume the adventure from where you left off.<br>Would welcome a co-op mode, and a controller is recommended to enjoy it to the fullest.<br>The islands are generated procedurally and consist in hexagonal parts, but the setting is a bit too repetitive.<br>The skills are unlocked as we defeat the enemies, which provide us with experience and breaking the crates present on the islands, you can get coins to upgrade your ship.<br>The tutorial is short and effective; there are also some treasures only for collecting purpose.<br>The bugs are few and violence is very soft, cartoon style.<br>My advice is to wait to buy it on sale, but if you are attracted by the graphic style and genre, buying it now you will still have a full play and fun game at the right point.<br><br><br><b><br><br>graphic 8<br>sound 7<br>longevity 7.5<br>gameplay 7<br><br>vote 7.5<\/b><br><br><br><br><div class=\"bb_code\"><div class=\"bb_h1\">FANTARMA COMMUNITY <\/div>\n<a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/FantarmaC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > Click to join our  Group <\/a> \n\n<a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/FantarmaC#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > Click me and follow us as Curator  <\/a> \n<\/div><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=740128762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=740128762<\/a><br><br><br><u>ITALIAN:<\/u><br><br><br><br>Lost Sea \u00e8 un gioco indie action-avventura, con elementi roguelike e di sopravvivenza, in ambiente 3D ruotabile a 360 gradi, caratterizzato da una grafica colorata e alcuni elementi innovativi per il genere.  <br>Ambientato su varie isole nel triangolo delle bermuda, dopo che una tempesta ci ha fatto naufragare in questo luogo, dovremo reclutare vari sopravvisuti e sopravvivere ad alcuni boss, uno per ogni stage (giungla,deserto,palude e neve), provando a scappare dalle isole Bermuda.<br><br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pro<\/div>  <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>steam cloud, achievement e carte collezionabili<br><\/li><li>presenta numerose lingue<br><\/li><li>supporto controller completo<br><\/li><li>steam os, linux e mac<br><\/li><li>requisiti sistema abbordabili<br><\/li><li>isole create con la generazione procedurale<br><\/li><li>grafica colorata e musica pi\u00f9 che sufficiente<br><\/li><li>prezzo in linea con qualit\u00e0 del prodotto<br><\/li><li>tutorial efficace<br><\/li><li>adatto a tutte le et\u00e0 <br><\/li><li>rilassante semplice e immediato<br><\/li><li>alcune idee interessanti<br><\/li><li>buon numero di tesori collezionabili<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Contro<\/div>  <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>permadeath, al momento nessuna possibilit\u00e0 di salvataggio <br><\/li><li>il gameplay pu\u00f2 risultare ripetitivo <br><\/li><li>equipaggio non molto utile<br><\/li><li>difficolt\u00e0 mal calibrata <br><\/li><li>backtracking presente e abbastanza fastidioso<br><\/li><li>Ai scarsa, nessuna minimappa <br><\/li><li>combattimento poco profondo<br><\/li><li>trama appena abbozzata<br><\/li><li>poca variet\u00e0 dei nemici, molto grinding <br><\/li><li>pu\u00f2 essere scomodo con tastiera<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> <br>\nNote: <\/div>  <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>\u00e8 presente una versione drm-free del gioco su altre piattaforme<\/li><\/ul><br>In conclusione Lost Sea \u00e8 divertente se giocato a piccole dosi;

al di fuori del tutorial non \u00e8 presente nessuna storia che possa intrattenere fino alla conclusione del gioco.<br>Non \u00e8 presente nessuna minimappa, il che \u00e8 snervante per il dover aprire costantamente la mappa generale,ed \u00e8 fastidioso anche il dover tornare sui propri passi, ogni volta raccolto l\u2019artefatto che ci permette di cambiare isola.<br>Manca anche la possibilit\u00e0 di salvare, che se non si ha abbastanza tempo \u00e8 frustrante, perch\u00e9 costringe ad affrontare ogni bioma e boss senza poter riprendere l\u2019avventura dal punto in cui si era arrivati.<br>Sarebbe stata gradita una modalit\u00e0 co-op, ed \u00e8 consigliato un controller per goderlo al meglio.<br>Le isole sono generate proceduralmente e sono composte da parti esagononali, ma l\u2019ambientazione risulta un po' troppo ripetitiva.<br>Le abilit\u00e0 saranno sbloccate man mano che ci sconfiggono i nemici, i quali ci forniscono esperienza e rompendo le casse presenti sulle isole, si possono ottenere monete per potenziare la propria nave. <br>Il tutorial \u00e8 breve ed efficace;

Textures are mainly clean, bright colours, continuing the cartoon theme, and models seem to have relatively low poly counts, although are nicely animated.<br><br>There's a day-night cycle with nice lighting changes and a rain effect, which is also quite nice, but it seems to me that it never rains during the day part of the cycle and always rains at night, which is a bit disappointing.<br><br>The game includes some nice little graphical touches like animated plants blowing in the breeze and a shark swimming around the docks, which serve to give a bit more life to the world. Unfortunately there's no manual camera zoom, though, so if you want to see anything up close you're out of luck.<br><br>Sound - Sound effects are suitable. They're not bad, but there's nothing special about them either. There are no voices for the different characters in the game, which leaves it feeling a bit empty. Music is catchy, with a sort of pirate adventure movie feel to it.<br><br>Gameplay - Lost Sea plays like a classic console action adventure game. You can play with keyboard (no mouse), but a controller is fully supported and recommended. Controls are simple: left stick for movement, right stick for camera rotation, and buttons for interaction, attack, sprint, dodge, etc.<br><br>The game is made up of four zones, each with a different theme. Each zone contains a series of individual islands, culminating in a boss level, although in the case of Lost Sea you don't have to (and can't) visit every island; instead the runes you collect act like dice to determine how many islands you hop over on your next journey. Each island is then made up of a series of hexagonal outdoor areas, each enclosed on all sides except where it connects to an adjoining room. Each island, although outdoors, ends up looking like some sort of modular habitat when viewed on the map, with a few exceptions.<br><br>Where Lost Sea differs from classic games in the genre is in its use of rogue-like elements, namely permadeath and procedural generation of islands. Unfortunately, though, neither one really works that well here. The base components for the procedural generation are mostly large, and you'll often see whole hexagonal areas copied from one island to the next, which not only breaks the suspension of disbelief, but also makes for a repetitive game. Permadeath, also, doesn't really work that well in this game, as dying simply causes frustration in making you start again; there's no carry-over benefit outside of normal progression, and the levels are all similar enough that even though you don't end up playing exactly the same islands next time you play, you might as well be doing so for all the variation you'll see.<br><br>Lost Sea also includes the concept of crew members: seemingly random people who you find at various points on each island who will join you as your slave without even exchanging a single word with you. Each crew member has up to four skills that he or she can use to boost your abilities in the game, from unlocking chests or repairing wooden bridges, to resurrecting you (once only) if you die. It's a bit silly, but is a good addition to the game. Unfortunately, though, the crew members are also very limited in implementation, with only a handful of skills meaning that you quickly max out your limited quota of crew with the most useful skill combinations, and just ignore anyone else you meet. Poor pathfinding and an inability of the crew to move out of harm's way lead to increased frustration as well.<br><br>Finally, making the repetitiveness issue even worse is the amount of backtracking you'll find yourself needing to do on islands to deliver tablets back to the docks, or go back and pick up items or crew that you didn't have space for before. This is especially painful in the early game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n-------------------------------------PROS &amp; CONS------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Pros:<br>+ Rogue-like additions are a great idea, but need more work to fully realise their potential benefits to the genre<br>+ Crew are a good idea (but, see Cons ...)<br>+ Good cel-shaded graphics with nice animations<br>+ Steam Achievements<br>+ Trading Cards<br><br>Cons:<br>- Lots of backtracking required<br>- Procedural generation seems to be based on a small number of large sections, making many levels look the same, adding to the repetitiveness<br>- Limited number of enemy types<br>- Limited crew skill options make talking to most potential crew members unnecessary after the first couple of islands<br>- Crew are braindead and easily become stuck on terrain or won't try to avoid even the simplest trap or enemy<br>- No manual zoom<br>- No introduction or cut scenes, outside of small in-game scripted events; not everything is explained that well<br>- Needs a little bit more QA<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>I've listed a lot more cons than pros in this review, but don't let that give you the wrong impression.

The randomly generated islands and the skill\/upgrade system help improve the replayability of the game.<br><br>Having said that, the island's procedural layouts do very little to make them feel different from one another, and the skill system never made me feel like I was progressing as a character in meaningful ways.<br><br>Luckily, for those who can look past the shortcomings, Lost Sea has tight, reactive controls and offers a pretty good challenge, awarding players who take a slow and steady approach to completing each island.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed my time with Lost Sea and if it weren't for the floaty combat, bad AI pathing, and somewhat forgettable skills, I could easily recommend this game to roguelike fans.

Rogue-like lovers or players who enjoy exploration and strategy will find a lot to like in this title but it is far from a perfect experience.<br><br>Positives -&gt;<br><br>+ The music and art are appropriately jaunty and pleasing.<br>+ Procedrual generation, differing regions and areas within regions, a day\/night cycle and dynamic weather keep the game feeling fresh and interesting as you explore.<br>+ The game adds a layer of strategy and management not often found in rogue-like games.  Crew management, tablet rescuing and rpg style upgrades all give you strategic options for you to mess around with.<br>+ The game feels fun to explore.  You're rewarded for looking in every nook and cranny of the islands by discovering a myriad of game resources that help you through your journey.<br><br>Negatives -&gt;<br><br>- The combat can be one-dimensional and begin to become dull.  Player upgrades eventually help to make the combat more dynamic and interesting but don't do enough to completely fix the problem.<br>- The game suffers from having no minimap.  Having to constantly open the map to check your position relative to where you want to explore merely serves to slow down the gaming experience.<br>- Boss battles are fairly repetitive.  They are structured, not random and from one battle to the next the mechanics of the fight change only slightly.  It seems like much more interesting and grandiose things could have been done for boss battles.<br>- The game's AI is unfortunately idiotic.  Getting stuck behind walls is a constant struggle and leaves you needing to run back and collect the crew that got lost behind you.  They can also serve as a massive headache during skirmishes with enemies and it can be difficult to keep them alive in later sections of the game.<br><br><br>For those looking for my expanded thoughts -&gt; <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/checkpointgaming.net\/reviews\/2016\/07\/lost-sea\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/checkpointgaming.net\/reviews\/2016\/07\/lost-sea\/<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24119701', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24119701' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24119701\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24119701' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24119701\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24119701', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24119701_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24119701_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24243055\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gamesear\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"251242417\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/676eb7ef0935f9db7e21272ac99f7ef06bc0eb10.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/676eb7ef0935f9db7e21272ac99f7ef06bc0eb10.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/676eb7ef0935f9db7e21272ac99f7ef06bc0eb10_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gamesear\/\" data-miniprofile=\"251242417\">Ash<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gamesear\/games\/?tab=all\">58 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gamesear\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gamesear\/recommended\/334280\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Lost Sea for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLost Sea is an indie action adventure that features some lovely visuals, procedurally generated levels, an absolute ton of loot to collect, and a combat system rather evocative of the old Zelda series, though a whole lot easier and simpler than that. With all of that said, its also worth mentioning that Lost Sea is designed with a more casual audience in mind, so if you're a hardcore fan of roguelikes you will find very little for yourself here. On the other hand, if you're looking for a relaxing game for either yourself or your kid, then you're looking in the right direction.<br><br>Since the text area here on Steam is a bit limited, I've broken down this review into various categories to hopefully give you a good idea of what Lost Sea is all about:<br><br><b>*Controls<\/b><br>For reasons unknown, Lost Sea doesn't feature a way to change the controls from within the in-game menu! You can do so by messing around with a config file buried deep within the Steam folder, but due to the initial controls being awkward on small keyboards I can see this causing a whole ton of frustration, especially for the younger\/less experienced players that might not even know about config files. This should be an easy thing to fix, on account of the fix already being &quot;there&quot;, so I hope its something the developers correct as soon as possible.<br><br><b>*Presentation<\/b><br>While it might not have the graphical fidelity to match the AAA games of today, Lost Sea features a charming art style that makes exploration a pure joy. All of the islands are filled with vibrant colors, shading is used to great effect in order to create somewhat realistic environments, and the various regions you can visit feel fresh and unique, despite using basically the same &quot;building elements&quot;. <br><br>To further add on to the atmosphere we have the music, which while not numerous exhibits the same sort of charm as the visuals. To put it simply, all of this combined makes Lost Sea a rather relaxing experience, something I certainly didn't expect to see given the non-optional permadeath.<br><br><b>*Procedurally Generated Levels<\/b><br>Lost Sea is a roguelite, and as such it has a need for a massive amount of levels that you can replay over and over again. Thankfully, the procedural generation is done admirably and outside of a few pre-build chunks you won't be able to notice island repeat themselves. The level design is a quite simple, however, so you will start seeing some patterns here and there, but in terms of item placement, enemies and visual elements, the procedural generation does an excellent job.<br><br><b>*Items and loot<\/b><br>The main reason you would ever risk your life exploring in a roguelike is the loot, and Lost Sea features an absolute ton of it, most of it in the form of gold. Best of all, the whole process of looting, everything from smacking the barrel to the sound the coins make when you collected them, is an absolute joy to the eyes and ears. <br><br>Unfortunately, the majority of the loot is completely pointless as most of the gold-based upgrades are useless, and the entirety of your power comes from combat experience and followers, which also come from combat experience. Its a real shame since the looting does feel just as good as I said, but due to lacking upgrades its almost never worth it to risk even a smidgen of health to acquire entire bundles of treasure.<br><br><b>*Combat <\/b><br>As I've mentioned in my introduction, the combat in Lost Sea feels like it was taken from an old Zelda game. You only have one attack, your sword swing, and with it you will need to bounce away enemies as they charge at you, stun those that might try and throw coconuts at you, and in general survive through well-timed attacks and positioning. The sword swings themselves feel satisfying, with each one giving off those satisfying swish and thunk noises as you swing your sword around and into enemies, with the end result being a rather enjoyable fighting system.<br><br>However, while the act of fighting is enjoyable, its also extremely exploitable and you can downright destroy the difficulty through one simple &quot;trick&quot;. Just mash the attack button. Instead of relying on timing and finesse, you can instead create an impenetrable wall of blades infront of you and just mow down enemies by the hundreds, practically impervious to harm from anything but the strongest of foes. If that doesn't make Lost Sea easy enough for you, the follower system further makes it so that any semblance of challenge can swiftly be erradicated.<br><br><b>*Followers<\/b><br>The followers are by far the most innovative idea Lost Sea puts forward, though sadly they are a bit too underutilized for my liking. Their main purpose is to offer you ways of traversing obstacles or picking up hidden loot, either by building bridges, unlocking chests or digging up buried stashes. Since you start with only one follower slot and need to spend a surprising amount of experience unlocking the other three, one would think that choosing the right follower with the right skills would be a crucial aspect of your survival, but it really isn't.<br><br>There are only 3-4 progression-based skills such as Craftsmanship or Lockpicking, with the rest mostly being combat and experience related, and since each follower can have 4 randomized skills its easy to fulfill all of the &quot;requirements&quot; with only one crewmember, and then chose the rest based around their combat benefits. The followers don't fight along with you, they are too cowardly for that, but what they do instead is amplify the amount of damage you do to quite frankly ridiculous levels. Yetis are usually quite tanky enemies and present a significant challenge when you get surrounded by a few of them, but if you have even a couple of followers with the Damage Buff attribute, something that is incredibly easy to achieve, you will be able to one-shot some of the strongest enemies in the game, and thus the challenge gets thrown out of the window.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> In short <\/div><br>Lost Sea is a nice and relaxing romp through exotic locations littered with more treasure than a pirate would ever know what to do about. The highlights for me are the exploration of some beautifully rendered and procedurally generated islands, the process of finding and hoarding tons of loot, and the feeling of slowly upgrading your character with newer and better skills. On the other hand, all of the elements that directly relate to combat and the roguelike progression system are just not compelling enough for me to keep playing Lost Sea once I'm done with this review, despite the 4-5 hours I've spent with it being fairly enjoyable.<br><br>If you're interested in a hardcore roguelike experience with perfectly balanced combat and items, I'm afraid you won't find any of that in Lost Sea. However, if you're looking for a cheerful and upbeat game to give your kid and guarantee that they will be both entertained and adequately challenged, then Lost Sea might just be the one you're looking for.<br><br>If you'd like a more detailed review, one that's actually backed up with some gameplay footage, I welcome you to check out the video I've done on just that topic:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7tLoFgU2f1E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7tLoFgU2f1E<\/a><br>Or if you're a man of the written word, the full review on my website:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gamesear.com\/reviews\/lost-sea-detailed-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.gamesear.com\/reviews\/lost-sea-detailed-review<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24243055', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24243055' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24243055\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24243055' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24243055\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24243055', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24243055_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24243055_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28583763\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/planktonvomit\/recommended\/334280\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"27718053\">Plankton<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGameplay here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/planktonvomit\/v\/109531118\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/planktonvomit\/v\/109531118<\/a><br><br>Cool little game I picked up during Steam 2016 Holiday Sale.

My only real concerns are the controls are (obviously) not designed for computers, so you will either need to map them to a more comfortable set up, or use a controller. <br><br>If you enjoy puzzles or adventure games you will lose a ton of time into this game.
