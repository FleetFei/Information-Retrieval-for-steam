Look no further as Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is what you need.<\/blockquote> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Game Overview<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><b>Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age<\/b> is an open world action RPG that focuses on a theme inspired by the vibe of the 1980s. You play as Phoban, an aspiring wizard who attempts to follow the footsteps of their father by joining the Order and the younger brother of Deimon. <br><br>Getting a grasp on how the gameplay goes is fairly easy as the game guides you through any new stuff or mechanic that you encounter throughout the whole play through. The game has five (5) different spell categories that you can learn and master which are: Neonmancy, Vegemancy, Sanctumancy, Fulgomancy and Necromancy. These spells, along with the minions that you can summon at your disposal (referred to as &quot;grims&quot;) needed to be learned first and requires a certain number of item drops to be crafted before it is usable in combat.<br><br>All in all, there are twenty (20) spells and sixteen (16) grims that you can craft and research, with each spell having their own use and functionality and each grim with their own unique passive and active skills. <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Pros<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n    <li><b>Unique Game Concept<\/b> - Deviating from the whole level-up norm of role-playing games, the unique setting of the game to get &quot;stronger&quot; is through collecting scrolls to craft your different kind of spells and finding and observing the abilities certain minions to turn and summon them as your grims, which are both unique and interesting. In addition to that, the game play of it being acted on real time makes it more engaging and challenging at the same time.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Clean Game Graphics<\/b> - Aside from the game getting the visualization of what the 80s feel like and setting the theme perfectly, what I really like in the graphics is that it shows a really clean interface through-out as well as with the designs of all of the game assets (characters, scenery, effects, etc.).<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Beautiful Soundtracks<\/b> - This is definitely one of the greatest assets that the game can offer, and I can proudly say that I have idled the game a few times while on play just to listed to its soundtracks. It is very captivating, nostalgic, and most of all, it doesn't sound annoying even after long periods of playing.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Local Co-op Ready<\/b> - The game features the ability of enabling up to four (4) additional players to control over your &quot;grims&quot; (summoned minions), however their actions are limited only to the actions that the grims are able to do (in which they are only able to do the normal and special attacks).<\/li><\/ul> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Cons<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n    <li><b>Weak Story Delivery<\/b> - Don't get this wrong. This doesn't mean that the game doesn't have a backdrop that makes it deeper, as it does execute well in foreshadowing and setting the theme. However, the game suffers on a poor dialogue delivery of the characters, which in turn fails to make it more immersive story-wise. For example, a sacrifice of a certain character when giving up his life for his loved ones should be somewhat dramatic, right? In this game's case, it failed to give that dramatic feeling. Hence, displaying a poor delivery of the story.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Low Replay Value<\/b> - Aside from the fact that this game could be played co-op locally with your friends or replaying the game through another difficulty, there really isn't anything that could bind you to into playing the game again once you have finished a single play through. Some reasons include the story's linearity (although, there are some few choices that can be made in the game but it doesn't really affect the story that much), as well as the lack of side-quest presence (though some summons and spells might require some grinding to get them all).<\/li><\/ul> <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Verdict<\/b><\/u><\/div><br>In the sum of all the pros and cons, this  game is <b>fun to play and is definitely worth the value it asks.<\/b> <br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rankmenotplz\/recommended\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >reviews<\/a>, or follow our curator group at <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/GoodGamesGR#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Good Games Giveaways &amp;

This is the dev team\u2019s second game on Steam and they have shown clear signs that they\u2019re capable of delivering a quality game.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age features a very complex combat system focusing on five magical schools with many spells and disciplines to master. It wouldn\u2019t be an RPG without a set of skills so that is also provided. I found the RTS style of combat to be far better than a TBS form found in the Shadowrun series, for example. Plenty of tactical opportunities that require careful planning. The boss fights can be challenging but that is not a bad thing at all. The game has no leveling system but this novel aspect wasn\u2019t really an issue since you still have real progression through skills and spells. Despite being an open world, the story has no side quests and the linearity of it all, did bother me enough to consider it a con. This beautiful  game world really needs more activities and quests to blend in with the many easter eggs and pop culture references already present. The fact that we have a multiplayer option in the form of local co-op can be the saving grace for those that find SP playthroughs too tedious.<br> <br>The graphical details in Megamagic are top quality. As far as 2D sprites go, you can\u2019t have them any better than this. The lighting, the particle effects and shading diversity, all scream 2016. The areas and NPCs have been very well polished and I haven\u2019t seen many texture glitches either. So you have a beautiful game in isometric projection which emulates classic RPGs from the past with a modern twist.<br> <br>The soundtrack is provided by composer Mitch Murder, of Hotline Miami 2 and Kung Fury fame. Someone who composed for those two gems, can\u2019t go wrong with a 3rd \u201880s spinoff title, can he? The game\u2019s sounds and music score is brilliant and fits well within the setting and story. Definitely no complaints here.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Intriguing type of gameplay found in few titles<br>+ Beautiful graphics and effects<br>+ Steam Trading Cards &amp; Achievements<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- Somewhat liniar storyline<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Result \/ Final thoughts<\/div>I truly enjoyed playing Megamagic. It felt like a game with true potential for more, perhaps even a sequel or two. Only con I could find was the liniar story but even that can be fixed through further updates and DLCs or expansions. The map is large and you have many hours ahead of you, should you give the game a well deserved chance.

I am not a big fan of RPGs, i did play quite few but it's hard for me to find something that i really like within this genre.<br>I loved the theme of the game, the story, and all the little details, and i was afraid i will end up not liking the game very much.<br><br><br><b>A short introduction<\/b><br>I usually don't talk much about stories because i don't feel that i am in the position to judge a group of people's vision, or how they express it, and if you read other of my reviews, i usually just focus on technical stuff as i believe pretty much everything else is completely subjective.<br>But, i just want to mention that the story of this game is very original and genuine. Despite it being set in the 80s - Early 90s, it's very different than other similar games or movies.<br><br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>While it's listed as an RPG aswell, it's not your average type of RPG, i would classify it as a 'Action-Adventure\/Button Mashing' game with RPG elements.<br>You do learn spells, you get more creatures that you can summon and such, these RPG elements are kept to a pretty minimalistic state, and i liked it.<br>The story is split into 12 chapters, with the last 2 or 3 being slightly shorter, each of them bringing in new twists and plots that will keep your passion going and going.<br>Bosses aren't hard to beat at all, except <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Vertebreaker<\/span><\/span> and <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Merklyn<\/span><\/span>, which, for some reason, the first i mentioned is almost as hard to beat as the second.<br>Levels\/Cities are different and unique, which brings again some more diversity into the game.<br>I wasn't very fond of how many dialogues there were in the game, they can get frustrating because you have to keep clicking and clicking. This is something i wish they would've made a bit more discrete, or at least the dialogues to be shorter.<br>It provides you with around 10-12 hours of fun, and it also does have some replay potential.<br><br><br><b>Music - Visual Aspects - Achievements<\/b><br>The music from the main menu instantly brought me flashbacks of Street Fighters and King of Fighters, similar and classy! <br>The actual soundtrack of the game was pleasant, the cheesy and glorious kind of music you'd expect in such a game. I hope they will add the option to purchase the OST.<br>Visuals in this game are delicate, and they are so soft that sometimes you won't even notice some things when you are deeply focused into the actual game, and i admire how they worked quite a bit even on some small stuff that probably 90% of the players won't even notice.<br><br>If you're an achievement hunter you will probably like this game because about half of the achievements you get just by playing, and the rest require just a bit of work (The one about finding all the chest might be the most painful one).<br><br><br><b>Bottom Line<\/b><br>Very fun and interesting game to play with only few drawbacks, and considering the price-tag, i'd say for 10-12 hours of content, it's a pretty damn must-buy.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Intriguing and genuine story<br><\/li><li> Eargasmic sexy music<br><\/li><li> More than enough content (Considering the standards nowadays at least!)<br><\/li><li> Replay value<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Dialogues can be frustrating when they tend to be pretty long<br><\/li><li> Controls aren't rebindable at the moment (However, they are perfect as they are now anyway.

Now i\u2019m not going to give too much away about the story as for me this was the reason I kept playing and playing and I\u2019d hate to spoil any of it. There is great substance and depth to it and I genuinely felt myself wanting to help Phoban and ultimately find out what happens to him and the rest of the people you meet. The dialogue is really well written and very witty with many pop culture references which is fun. The more I played the more I felt myself becoming attached to various characters and hating others which to me is always a sign of fantastic writing. The game follows a linear story across multiple chapters that most conclude with awesome boss fights.<br><br><b>General Gameplay<\/b><br>The gameplay is fairly easy to grasp and everything is explained in a tutorial for those unfamiliar. Spells are your main attack but you also have grims which are summonable creatures which will fight on your behalf. You start with a single grim and two or three spells but you\u2019ll quickly find new spells throughout the world along with learning how to summon new grims. Spells can be found on scrolls but the grim system is very different and very interesting. Instead of capturing grims or learning how to summon them you must instead \u2018research\u2019 them. Grims have passive, active and special abilities and you\u2019ll need to encounter your chosen grims and witness their abilities. Once you\u2019ve seen the required amount of abilities and collected the required elements you can then \u2018craft\u2019 that grim for use whenever you want. There are many spells and grims in the game to discover, though some will require a little more looking than others. Your hotbar can only hold five spells and three grims though, so no matter how many you have learn you\u2019ll only have 8 total abilities to choose from at any one time.<br><br>Though the story is linear there is a nice sized world which can be explored and MOST areas can be revisited after leaving them so there is a nice optional element of exploration there. This being said there are no side-quests as incentive to explore so it\u2019s entirely up to you to progress directly through the game or veer of the path slightly. <br>Along with combat you\u2019ll also find puzzles dotted around the game world ranging from simple memory puzzles to timing puzzles and even a quick platformer style dodge the object puzzle. Most of these will require you to use your grims and spells to complete and are a nice little break from the usual combat based gameplay you\u2019ll be encountering. I actually enjoyed the puzzles a lot more than the combat and found myself wishing the puzzle\/combat ration was reversed.<br><br><b>Graphics and Audio<\/b><br>The graphics of Megamagic are nice with a nostalgic retro feel. The isometric feel alongside all the neon lights and awesome soundtrack give the game a great 80\u2019s feel. The graphics options are limited though with a noticeable lack of a windowed mode option which was a little annoying as I tend to play games in windowed when I\u2019m using multi-monitors for other things.<br><br><b>Cons<\/b><br>My ONLY two negatives about the game is the combat\/controls and the lack of a levelling system. The controls are the biggest issue for me  and if i\u2019m honest, it made me quit the game multiple times. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I HATE them, especially in combat and they are UNMAPPABLE. Moving my minions with shift &amp; click WHILST moving myself with WASD WHILST casting with 1-8 WHILST holding shift &amp; click to cast my minions special WHILST using space to dash away (my only defense) is just too much. There\u2019s nothing more to it. Everything would be a lot easier if I could remap my keys because changing shift to my extra mouse buttons would fix this entirely as way I could control myself with one hand and my minions with the other.<br>This is made so much worse by the games stupid spawn rates on enemies. I understand this probably sounds rude but it needs to be fixed and multiple people have complained about it on the discussion and have just been ignored by the developers. Enemies currently respawn in an area the second you move out of sight from them which doesn\u2019t sound too bad until you realise some areas are full of weaving corridors where enemies will spawn behind you the second you defeat them with another mob in front of you killing you where you can\u2019t move <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>(Power Station is the biggest problem right now with this issue)<\/span><\/span>.<br>The last thing which in my eyes is a con is the lack of any kind of levelling, be it for yourself, your spells or your grims so that minute amount of damage you do with your first spell in the tutorial is the same damage that spell will do the WHOLE game. It renders 75% of the spells unusable because they just become redundant. It would feel a lot more RPG-y if there was the choice to level stats or spells or grims or just something so you feel a little more in control of your playstyle.<br><br><b>Summary<\/b><br>Overall Megamagic is a fantastic game with a really, really, really well written story. The characters and lovable the dialogue is witty and clever and the puzzles are awesome. Though i\u2019m not a huge fan of the combat there is a narrative mode if you want to avoid it and the story is well worth every second.

It has some combat issues, but the story will keep you hooked from the intro cutscene.<\/div><br>.Story\/Premise.<br>Megamagic is set in a future where the collision between Earth and a meteor results in the &quot;Neon Age&quot; in which people can use magic. You are Phoban, the son of a great wizard who stole an ancient artefact: a staff that possesses the power to grant the user with a single wish. Within the artefact is a critter you've befriended by the name of Fum who will die once the staff's power is used and you just can't have that. Thus, the race is on to prevent people from using the staff and killing of your blue cloud buddy. You'll fight off members of a powerful magical order, punks, robots, magical summons known as Grims--and then some. All in order to save your friend. <br><br>Megamagic spans over a dozen linear chapters, most of which end with a boss fight of sorts, and the story is well-written. You'll find yourself wondering about characters and their motives during your romp through the Megamagic world and each is developed in such a way that you want to know more about this magical world Phoban inhabits.<br><br>.Game play.<br>You use the WASD keys to move around and the mouse to attack. Exploration is limited as the only thing you'll find by wandering around is more enemies. Occasionally you'll find breakable objects resembling chests that you can break open for materials in crafting spells, but not frequently enough to warrant breaking away from the beaten path. <br><br>Enemies wander the map and will attack you on sight, so keep your wits about you. They won't stop between spawn zones, so running away isn't an option as doing so will usually just result in being overrun by hostiles. Your spells, including Phoban's personal spells and the Grims he summons, are hotkeyed to your numeric buttons 1-9; you select a spell by pressing one of these keys and then you use that spell by clicking the right mouse button. You can control your Grim (or Grims) by holding down the shift key. This becomes incredibly difficult when you're trying to run around with WASD in order to avoid dying while simultaneously attempting to tell your Grims to target something specific.<br><br>You can also steal energy by getting within range of an enemy and hitting the 'f' key.<br><br>In order to learn more spells, you need to craft them using materials you gather upon slaying enemies. The system is intuitive and easy, but pretty shallow from an RPG standpoint. Grims can also be learned through crafting, though obtaining them is a little more complex. In order to do so, you have to have slain a certain number of the Grim in question and will also have to have seen the Grim use its special and passive skills in combat. Once those parameters are fulfilled, it's just a question of having the correct materials and you'll be able to add your new Grim to your hotkey bar no problem.<br><br>You'll also use your Grims to solve puzzles, which I must admit are quite rewarding to figure out. Sometimes you'll manually control them in order to press switches out of Phoban's reach and sometimes you'll use them as cannon fodder in order to figure out the safer path. I quite enjoyed them and, though there were a few head-scratchers, I haven't encountered anything too difficult to solve on my own.<br><br>.BGM and Art Style.<br>The soundtrack is catchy and funky. I found myself humming along on more than on occasion. If you even remotely liked the music from the trailer, you'll enjoy the rest of what Megamagic has to offer.<br>The characters and world are brightly coloured, the former being drawn in a cartoon-y style. No two areas look the same, and stylistically every one of the characters from the main cast are radically different. In short, the game looks great. There's a shortage of Grim types, but that's a minor complaint.<br><br>.Longevity.<br>I'm on the fourth chapter as of writing this review and it's taken me around 4 hours to get here. I'm sure the later chapters will be longer, so it's safe to assume that you'll get 20+ hours if you're taking your time to read the story. There are three difficulties, but there're no achievements tied to the hardest difficulty, so it's likely that only people wanting to test themselves will select it. That being said, I've died plenty of times on normal--to the point where I had to take a five-minute break before reattempting a fight.<br><br>.Pros and Cons.<br>+Colourful, cartoon-y art style.<br>+Catchy soundtrack.<br>+Well-written story.<br>+Well-rounded character and character dynamics.<br>+The ability to summon familiars that act independent (or not) of you.<br>+Fun, not-too-difficult puzzles.<br>-Combat<br>This is where this game falls short. Not in a huge, game-breaking way, but I'm sure if you've read other reviews for this game you've heard the same complaint: combat is a little awkward and sometimes difficult to the point of cruelty. <br>-Spawn rate\/enemy spawn zoning<br>The spawn rate of enemy Grims is a little bugged: if you're walking with your own summons toddling behind you, they can reset the respawn timer of the zone you just left--resulting in another mob. If you were already fighting and running around to avoid projectiles when this happens, you can end up having multiple mods swarming you. I'm sure I don't have to tell you why this is a problem. There's currently no fix for the weird spawn rate, but controlling your units and sending them ahead of you works pretty well.<br>-Linear maps without many easter eggs or incentive to explore<br><br>.Bottom Line.<br>In its current state, I could recommend Megamagic: Wizards of a Neon Age only if you're okay with your action game lacking in the combat department. Everything else--the soundtrack, the story, and the character design--is polished and lovely, so it would be a shame to miss out on the experience because of a few hiccups. Megamagic is a solid adventure that will bring you back to the 80s without any need for a time machine.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23320016', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23320016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23320016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23320016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23320016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23320016', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23320016_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23320016_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23596742\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/RoyalFlush37\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"179023072\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d6a45de37c49d1e17299b4acfb5cfb384508ee9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d6a45de37c49d1e17299b4acfb5cfb384508ee9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d6a45de37c49d1e17299b4acfb5cfb384508ee9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/RoyalFlush37\/\" data-miniprofile=\"179023072\">RoyalFlush37<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/RoyalFlush37\/games\/?tab=all\">650 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/RoyalFlush37\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/RoyalFlush37\/recommended\/422650\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally nice game. I would recommend it to everyone who likes 80's style games. It has an amazing combat system for an indie title and some really good customizable talents and spells.<br>Graphically, the game really makes you think of the 80's, which is really nice, since that's what it aimed for.<br>The music tracks are amazing. They were made by the same guy who made the soundtrack for the Hotline Miami series, and it suits the game in a great manneer.<br>The gameplay has a storyline just like an RPG should have, but this game is unique because of the flexible abilities and the combat system.

It has an 80's retro feel aesthetically to it, but it is extremely responsive and fun to play.  You are able to summon creatures to fight alongside of you and have your friends or family members use controllers to help you battle. The combat is really fun action combat (instead of any boring tab target crap which I hate) where you have to aim your skills to hit the enemy creatures. I'm only on chapter three so far, but the game has a really nice story and tons of dialog that I'm actually interested in reading. As of yet I haven't run into any bugs or glitches at all, which makes me feel as if the creators put a lot of work into testing and polishing the game for release. Also, based on what I've seen so far in the spell book and summoning menus, there seem to be a lot of unique spells and summons in the game. The gameplay reminds me heavily of diablo 2 except there are a few puzzles mixed in and you have the ability to control your summons by yourself or with help of a friend.<br><br>The only real negative in my opinion is that you can't go online to battle others, although for someone who plays single player games or enjoys sitting in the same room as someone they are playing with, this game makes for a suprisingly good ARPG. The other small complaint I have is that pressing enter to go through the dialog makes me take my hand off the mouse frequently, (I'd almost rather spacebar serve as a skip dialog button) but it's not a major drawback as the game gives you plenty of time to put your hand back on the mouse before any fight sequences take place.<br><br>Overall I'd say I very much enjoy playing it and would recommend it to others.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24206944', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24206944' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24206944\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24206944' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24206944\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24206944', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24206944_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24206944_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23394024\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198286535086\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"326269358\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb62ca78960f2751af935920382286d7e1fe6abc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb62ca78960f2751af935920382286d7e1fe6abc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb62ca78960f2751af935920382286d7e1fe6abc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198286535086\/\" data-miniprofile=\"326269358\">treefrog48<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198286535086\/games\/?tab=all\">12 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198286535086\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198286535086\/recommended\/422650\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJust finished this game, it was pretty fun? Really, really enjoyed the art, and the story line was good, the dialogue was all really funny at times. It had a really cool game design where as you progress, you learn new spells and some other spells become obsolete, so you're kind of always changing exactly how you play the game. (I noticed some people mentioned this as a bad thing in their reviews, I guess it's just personal preference but I really liked it). Overall, I did like the game, there were definitely a few things that let it down though. There were a few bugs, with really crazy spawn rates in some areas, enemies not attacking, the AI of the grims was a bit out of whack sometimes, and sometimes if you haven't added a certain spell before a fight, it can make the boss almost impossible to beat <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> (e.g. Hogan &amp; the last boss. I spent like 20 minutes trying to beat Hogan and getting him barely down to half health) <\/span><\/span> so you might have to reload the game from an earlier point and then do some things all over again. The game also crashed my laptop when I first tried to load it (not sure what that was about). <br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> Also, major spoiler, but i was confused why Fum sacrificed himself to bring back Deimon, when he could have at least sacrificed himself to bring back... everyone that Merklyn had killed? If the magic was supposed to be that strong? Or at least the uncle guy from the beginning too. Something like that. Just thought it was a little weird, not exactly where I would have gone with the plot <\/span><\/span><br><br>BUT, overall, cool game! :^) Definitely would play a sequel if they make one (hoping they do)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23394024', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23394024' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23394024\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23394024' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23394024\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23394024', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23394024_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23394024_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23753262\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198114186986\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"153921258\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/927efb3543e64bd5946c6e6ae217e88192fff7fe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/927efb3543e64bd5946c6e6ae217e88192fff7fe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/927efb3543e64bd5946c6e6ae217e88192fff7fe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198114186986\/\" data-miniprofile=\"153921258\">guptanilabhra<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198114186986\/games\/?tab=all\">109 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198114186986\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198114186986\/recommended\/422650\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMega magic: Wizards of neon age is a fun, story rich, open World, indie, 80's themed , rpg game. Which gives its buyer his\/her moneys worth.If youre looking for an out of the World experience with a magic themed gameplay this is your game. The story is rich with ideas with beasts and summoned minions at every corner. So readers read on at your own peril.<br><br>This game is the story of Phoban who lives in a World which is at a time lapse from our World, for this World has changed after a meteor strike. This world is filled with magic, the type any normal human can master.Phoban a young mage around which the story revolves learns and develops new magic spells as the story goes on and tries to join a cult of mages as the story progresses just as his father and brother did.But here I must stop for too much information can a be a spoiler.But this much is noteworthy that as Phoban proceeds through this game he encounters new minions like wolf rat etc and evetually manages to summon most of them. The story is linear but really entertaining.<br><br>The game has a good 80's theme arcade music, which is easy for the ears yet some times unnoticable to the player.The graphics too is a typical 80's style presentation. The game is in one phrase a point and click game which has a great storyline as mentioned.The game has sevral new features which make for a smooth gameplay, like summoning creatures, casting magic spells, and cool batch of story based characters.<br><br>Bottom line  there are twenty  spells and sixteen  grims that you can craft and research in the game. With each spell having their own use and functionality and each grim with their own unique passive and active skills. There are a lot of pros and cons to this game, but to mention a few<br><br>PROS<br><br>1.Interactive linear based yet some what  non rigid storyline.<br>2.Good musical tracks (80s themed)<br>3.Cool graphics(80s themed)<br>4.In depth character development within the story<br>5.Local co op ready<br><br>CONS<br><br>1. The story has low replay value even though dynamic in nature.<br>2.Controls are weak<br><br>All in all its a great story rich character rich, rpg style 80's themed game. Definitely worth the money.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23753262', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23753262' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23753262\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23753262' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23753262\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23753262', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23753262_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23753262_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23593159\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darkki\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"29798628\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd04f8ef4163db7242d8099532a05078c9193a7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd04f8ef4163db7242d8099532a05078c9193a7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd04f8ef4163db7242d8099532a05078c9193a7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darkki\/\" data-miniprofile=\"29798628\">DARKKi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darkki\/games\/?tab=all\">4,131 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darkki\/recommended\/\">20 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darkki\/recommended\/422650\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">54.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">DARKKi's Dark Star Reviews - Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age<\/div><br>Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is an open world, altough linear ARPG (think about Diablo) that has 80's theme with pretty well written story to go with it. It is an easy game to get into as &quot;tutorial&quot; guides you trough all the new game mechanics that are introduced. You have access to spells and you can also summon different type of minions (grims) to your disposal (and also has co-op where up to four players can control your grims, which is nice and non-typical co-op addition) via collecting and crafting.<br><br>One thing is unique as an RPG to this game since you do not have levelling here at all. That does not mean that there is not RPG like progressing at all though. You will have to collect scrolls in order to craft different kind of spells and finding \/ researching grims in order to get them to your repertoire.

Megamagic has immediately surprised me: first, i didn't expect to have intro video in a small indie studio game; second i was surprised by how its done: a special kind of graphics - i would describe it as something in between modern flat trends, Borderlands-style and 80s comics.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">tutor<\/div>i've often met games that you run and don't understand how to play\\what to do; i even remember the case when i could not play a game until i found in the internet what should i do in it - but with Megamagic everything is as simple and as usable as it should be in all games - first things you do you meet a small tutor telling you how to move; how to avoid enemies and how to fight them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">graphics<\/div>on one hand its not something to take awards for overusing different effects and technologies,  but on other hand i can easily call it simply perfect: game's looking very nicely and pleasantly, graphics do not interfere the gameplay, but supports it, and i need to especially admit once again game gas its own visual atmosphere especially after tens of games using same unreal engine technologies and objects that make all these games look similarly.<br>this visual atmosphere, this styling include lots of created objects, lots of carefully drawn characters<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">sound<\/div>as i've already mentioned, there are games with soundtrack and games with some stock sounds. this one suprised me the very moment i run it with 80s atmosphere so truly delivered that i didn't hear from 80s :) overall soundtrack is great.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">gameplay<\/div>i see some complaints for the combat system and that keys cannot be rebinded - i felt no discomfort with the keys (i played with keyboard\\mouse, no joystick however) and i took combat quite ok too (at least until i lose :) - different games offer different experiences and this is why we play different games!<br>perhaps the dialogues sometimes are too long, but there are lots of games that consist of even more dialogs  so i took it as a genre limitations or requirements :)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">verdict<\/div>i can easily recommend the game as a high quality product and i think you won't regret purchasing it. because of this quality i wishlisted Nihilumbra, the other game done by this studio, and i wish every game developer\\publisher make games of this quality.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30123726', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30123726' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30123726\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30123726' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30123726\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30123726', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30123726_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30123726_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30101476\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haguen\/recommended\/422650\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"84962073\">Haguen<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat Game, Thanks!
