Furthermore, it is not like Total War (in a positive way, I'm a TW-fan myself). It focuses more on the strategic, econimcal and diplomatic aspects than TW. GA: Medieval offers an enjoyable, fully narrated campaign, alternatively an &quot;open world&quot; play mode and multiplayer mode. I have not yet tested the multiplayer, but will update the review once I have.  <br><br>My impressions so far from --- (very bad) to +++ (very good):<br><br><b>Stability: +++<\/b><br>No crashes and no issues with alt-tabbing in and out of game.<br><b>Music: ++<\/b><br>Nice, soft medieval background music. <br><b>Graphics: ++<\/b> <br>Better than the map view of current Total War titles so far. Lacks the unit details of TW, though, but zoom-in and zoom-out is far more smooth plus the weather details are better.<br><b>Gameplay: +++<\/b><br>In the campaign, you start as the ruler of a small city and have to increase your wealth and power by military and diplomatic means. The missions you receive during the campaign will help you with that. GA:Medieval has a very nice balance of micro- and macromanaging, which is something that I imagine is very hard to design. E.g. you can set up trading routes for your traders within seconds and just let them trade between these cities on their own. They do a good job with that. However, you can still take over manual control to send out traders to buy or sell the exact items in the exact quantities you need. You may stumble over &quot;adventure sites&quot; with your scouts which most times will result in small combats and a bit of loot, if you manage to get the upper hand. Diplomacy is no one-way communcation in this game. AI-Characters may contact you with diplomatic offers or even missions, which may raise or lower your diplomatic standing with other parties. You can decide which buildings to build in your cities, but have to keep an eye on what you want to produce with them, how much and what kind of ressources they need and if there are enough workers in your city to run the production building. Overall very nicely done with a lot of choices to be made.<br><b>Tactics: -<\/b><br>Since I mentioned Total War in my review, I thought it neccessary to touch the topic of &quot;tactics&quot; this game offers. There is no separation of strategic map movement and tactical battles. There is one map which handles both. You do not control the movement of units in battle and so forth. You send them into battle and can pull them out, if you feel that you have to. In this aspect, GA:Medival is far, far behind of TW. If you think GA:Medieval is another TW-clone and you play TW because of the tactical battles, then GA:Medieval will be a vast disapointment in this matter. On the plus site, units in GA:Medieval tend to follow a rock\/paper\/scissors mechanic, e.g. Archers beeing superior against infantry, but weak against cavalry etc. So you have the tactical option of chosing which units to send into battle against which enemy.<br><b>Multiplayer: ?<\/b><br>Not yet tested.<br><br>I'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.<br><br><u>EDIT 1: <\/u><br>The first good impressions did no lie. It's good and it's getting better, including NOT A SINGLE graphic or game bug, crash or other technical issue after hours of continous gameplay. Remember that this is the first day of the game's release! Furthermore, and I try not to spoiler, I want to let you know that the advancement of your rank isn't just a number that increases over time. Entire new aspects of the game become available and you continously shift from micromanaging to macromanaging - without losing the ability to micromanage units, cities and so on if you feel you should intervene. <br><br><u>EDIT 2:<\/u><br>The story of the campaign is easy to follow and surprises with some &quot;interesting&quot; turns of events. Again, I don't mean to spoiler. That said, I just got the steam achievement &quot;Got Laid!&quot;. :D<br><br><u>EDIT 3:<\/u><br>There's far more trading to be done than I tought. Although you can &quot;fire and forget&quot; your trader units and send them on a trading route of cities you specified where they buy and sell stuff, you will still want to micro at least one trader unit. I'm still early in the game and maybe the weight of the trading aspect will shift once I've advanced my rank from names that sound mercantile (Merchant, Landlord, etc.) to more noble titles. I still review the Gameplay as very good (+++), but the focus on trading that I feel in this early stage of the game push the rating a little in the direction of &quot;only&quot; good (++) without justifying a demotion yet.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18187343', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18187343' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18187343\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18187343' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18187343\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18187343', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18187343_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18187343_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t154 of 198 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19184589\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"47028068\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19141becf2d20adaa787051b84d904f03473a5c5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19141becf2d20adaa787051b84d904f03473a5c5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19141becf2d20adaa787051b84d904f03473a5c5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47028068\">SimuLord<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/games\/?tab=all\">124 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/recommended\/\">23 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SimuLord\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">27.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a niche within a niche, designed to appeal to a very specific type of strategy game fan.  Basically, if you ever played another game from this same developer (Patrician 4, Port Royale 3, or Rise of Venice) and found yourself wishing that you could have a bigger role in building the actual world and not just trading in it, this game is everything you've ever wanted.<br><br>That's what this game ultimately is---a combination of a Civ-style empire builder (in real time) with 4X elements and the same trading simulation you know and love and have probably been playing since the days of Ascaron (from which studio Gaming Minds' people came, kind of like how Obsidian's full of Black Isle refugees and how Firaxis is Sid Meier's old Microprose team reincarnated.)<br><br>Once you know that, you can start taking this game on its own merits, and there's a lot here if you want to deep dive into it.  In theory, you could just produce all 20 of the game's commodities in four cities total and be completely self-sufficient, and that's a perfectly valid goal to set for yourself in freeplay, if an utterly limited way to do things.  Where the game shines is in how those resources interact.  Gone are the days from Patrician 4 where you constantly asked yourself &quot;why are the mills that make clothing nowhere near the places that manufacture their essential raw material?  Why would anyone want to make something that relies on shipping something in from 1500 miles away in a cog?&quot;  It makes game sense (profits proportional to effort required) but it's wildly unrealistic.<br><br>Now you can plan your economy based on what the land provides.  Make towns in meadows that serve as your nation's breadbasket, sending food to that mountain outpost that makes your metal goods.  Butter up your AI rival by creating a town that makes a ridiculous amount of money trading them what they need, and use diplomacy to keep from having to go to war.  Or master those economy mechanics to support a military, but note that realism is in place here---large standing armies just weren't part of this game's time period.<br><br>If you geek out on this genre (and check my Steam library---I geek out HARD on this genre), this is the game you've been waiting for, the culmination of everything a trade simulation and empire-type game can be.<br><br>But that comes with a warning---this game has a &quot;mixed&quot; Steam rating for a reason.  It is absolutely, positively not for everyone.  If you weren't blown away by the previous efforts from Gaming Minds, this will not make any new converts.  I recommend this game, but only to people who are ready to embrace what it has to offer.<br><br>(I haven't mentioned multiplayer, since I'm exclusively a singleplayer gamer.  Bear that in mind as well.)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19184589', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19184589' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19184589\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19184589' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19184589\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19184589', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19184589_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19184589_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t113 of 147 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19437552\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"102578850\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0ab7906159cb5a5fbb88b4936d81832fa61103c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0ab7906159cb5a5fbb88b4936d81832fa61103c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0ab7906159cb5a5fbb88b4936d81832fa61103c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/\" data-miniprofile=\"102578850\">Mourdeeb<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/games\/?tab=all\">64 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198062844578\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 2, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere has been a lot of bad comments on this game, and I just want to clear up some Myths.<br>For starters, this is a good game.  It's well thought out, and in depth.  The problem I see is many players don't understand the concept of supply driven economics.<br>Myth #1.  You just need 5 cities.....<br>  It's true, you can have 5 cities, and between them you can aquire all the resource types in the game....Seems fairly simple, even droll, However...This game has an in depth Economic aspect!!!  Trade is the primary source of income in the game.  That being said, your cities trade with one another, making profit, BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!   If all 5 cities have all the resources they need, and they only trade with one another, as the cities grow, the supply Increases, and the demand Decreases.  This causes the trades to become less, and less profitable, and eventually your trade routs are loosing money rather than making money, and you go bankrupt.<br>   You have to carefully choose which resources you have in each city, based on the resources available in the area of the city, AND the needs of the neighboring Cities, be they yours or another player, or the AI.  I'm just 10 Hours into the game, I am a Baron, with 8 Cities, I have a Standing army of 50 units, and I am a Millionare...Litterally.....<br>Myth #2.  There's no need to aquire more cities.<br>   The game has a research tree that, as you could guess, enhances your economic abilities, and gives advanced units etc. Every time you level up, you get 3 more points to invest in &quot;Development&quot; (the research tree.)  The most effective way to level up, is *Drum Roll*..Aquiring More cities.!  More cities means more research, means a stronger economy, means bigger military, etc.   You can bribe your way into gaining near by cities, or just build one your self.  Again, if you just sit there with 5 cities selling the same goods to them they are going to flatline.  Expansion is essential!<br>Myth #3.  There is no replayability.<br>   Perhaps not in the campaign, since it is a linear plot, but there are numerous strategies one could employ to try to advance, even in the Campaign.  The free play option, is just that.  You can adjust the difficulty and numerous aspects of the game in the Single player version, to say nothing of a Multiplayer version.  ( I have not gone into Multi PLayer yet.)<br>So replayability?...There's plenty.<br>  Now to be fair, the game does have some things I find amusing, if not anoying...Like n &quot;Army of wolves&quot;...350 wolves fighting as an organizd unit???? Rreally?? It wouldn't be so bad, but the will soundly defeat an army of 500 Militia...<br>Then there's the fact that your merchants Only focus on Profit when they are automated, and pay little attention to the city's Needs, like food, and they don't seem to prioritize certain resources over another in a city.  For example, I have a city that needs Coal to manufacture tools, But there is another city in the trade lane that is just low on coal in general (doesn't &quot;Need&quot; the coal).  The Merchant will drop the coal in the first city that is lowest in the product to gain the most profit, rather than send it to the city that requires it to produce a product First.  As a result, you sometimes have to micromanage trade routs.<br><br>All and all it's a great game.  Chalanging, fun, and in depth... You just need to have a basic understanding of Supply driven economics, and the rest is trial and error.<br>I absolutly recomend this game!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19437552', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19437552' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19437552\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19437552' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19437552\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19437552', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19437552_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19437552_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t127 of 170 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">12 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18242855\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"145130617\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/48\/482573472447d9f03af121351812b37efd24e1d2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/48\/482573472447d9f03af121351812b37efd24e1d2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/48\/482573472447d9f03af121351812b37efd24e1d2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/\" data-miniprofile=\"145130617\">Apsalar<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/games\/?tab=all\">2,090 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/apsalar54\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>***CAUTION!<\/b> THIS GAME HAS A <b>NARROW APPEAL<\/b> AND WILL NOT BE RIGHT FOR EVERYONE<b>***<\/b><br>***Please do your research and consider your expectations carefully before purchasing***<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">A Slick and Barebones Wedding of Kalypso's Strengths...And Nothing Else<\/div><br>Let's talk a little about the context that spawned the  &quot;whats&quot; and the &quot;whys&quot; behind Kalypso's Grand Ages franchise.  Hopefully we'll reach some insights about the games and their place in history.<br><br>Kalypso's flagship Tropico games are arguable among the best examples of the citybuilder genre in the last decade, and they've achieved a market saturation so viscous I'm confident in my assumption that you have most likely put at least a few hours into the franchise.  Kalypso uses a large portion of its sales capital to reinvest in the constant refinement of gameplay systems.  If there's one thing Kalypso knows how to make, it's a high-grade citybuilder.  For the most part in the Tropico games the major mangement systems and input-output relationships are balanced and intuitive- but also immersive and challenging.  Though I grudgingly admit that at some point Tropico 5's gameplay grew too cluttered and frenetic for me to enjoy. I'm old and I have ADD and I just can't keep up.<br><br>Meanwhile, however, Kalypso has been quietly producing, reproducing, and more or less defining the standards for many contemporary mechanics and play paradigms within the somewhat niche genre of historical commodity-management games.  If you already know all this, I hail you as a fellow and thank you for keeping the genre alive.  If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, take a look deep in game list or at old bundles gathering dust in the ether, or think back to deep sales you've ignored.  Kalypso developed its systems across three paralell historical franchises: Patrician, Port Royale, and Rise of Venice.  These games aren't for everyone, but what they do- a lite but compelling simulation of &quot;Invisible Hand&quot; market relationships- they do very well. Most fans of the genre (myself included) own and play most if not all of Kalypso's contributions. The systems reward gamers who approach situations with some shrewd forethought,  who conjure a little extra willingness to grind, and who summon the chutzpah to make a few heavy gambles against the caprice of future markets.  Usually this just keeps you in the black but when it all works as you planned, you and your dynasty become fabulousy wealthy, and your organization's trade activities grants your allies prosperity and your competitors destitution. In-game this extraordinary success just means some shifting digits on a little spreadsheet with some fancy historical trims. Maybe that's why this genre in its purer forms is such a niche product.<br><br>As a devotee of both genres I was giddy when word starting circulating about Kalypso's new concept, the &quot;Grand Ages&quot; franchise, which would combine the lessons from their other games into a seamless historical management sandbox.  Unfortunately what emerged, Grand Ages: Rome, was a jumbled Frankengame.  It was interesting but clunky and unintuitive, a sort of high-concept quagmire with a confused sense of scale and a baffling set of competing paradigms. Kalypso had included almost every system they'd ever made and then threw some more in there on top for good measure.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">A Roman Pundit Said &quot;There's Nothing New Under the Sun&quot;...By Medieval Times Most of the Old is Gone Too...<\/div><br>If GA: Rome is one side of the pundulum's swing, then GA: Medieval is the full swing opposite.  Kalypso has eliminated everything but the commodity management sheets and has stripped city management down to a single interface book from which you can either build one of the limited and static improvements or upgrade your commodity production facilities.  The rest of the UI follows a similar pattern: icons move around a map and at certain times you interact with various spreadsheets to influence or direct markets and growth.<br><br>Don't get me wrong: it's deep and complex and finely balanced.  But it's startlingly narrow.  Every player is more or less exactly the same in terms of abilities and playfeel.  The only concessions to cultural distinctiveness are the local names and complexions of traders and governors.  The fact that the map is Europe is completely irrelevant to the gameplay, except that depending on your geography skills you may be able to predict resource placements.<br><br>If GA: Rome was a Frankengame, then GA: Medieval is a skeletal golem: its disparate pieces may function together so well that at first it seems a living thing- but it's not. There's little heart and no breath in this automaton.  But I am convinced Kalypso will continue their refinement and eventually the Grand Ages we dream of will emerge.<br><br><b>6\/10<\/b>-Conditionally recommended for niche fans and for collectors<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/justreviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > No Drama, Just Reviews <\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18242855', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18242855' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18242855\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18242855' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18242855\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18242855', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18242855_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18242855_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t159 of 221 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">8 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18197409\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"44363605\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/9498d6e01a8fc62ddf2be9fbb6bb4edc759a603b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/9498d6e01a8fc62ddf2be9fbb6bb4edc759a603b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/9498d6e01a8fc62ddf2be9fbb6bb4edc759a603b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"44363605\">Frogatron<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/games\/?tab=all\">416 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/forgo\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is amazing looking at all these reviews form poor to good that have so few hours; almost like everyone jumps on the review bandwagon to get their name out there despite their lack or knowledge of the game. I am no expert, by any means. But I pre-ordered and installed the moment I could. I spent most of my Friday playing. I had obligations after about my 7h mark. That being said: I recommend this game for the person who wants to play Empire Economic Sim. After about the 5 hour mark you finally get in to the combat part of the game. It is lite and not very in depth. It is very laissez faire, and if you are looking for some in depth combat, look somewhere else. The game is about establishing an empire and its trade routes. You build an army to protect that and take over other empires. <br><br>The combat is similar to Knights of Honor, if you know the reference. Your men attack in a battle if they are in the general vicinity. You get bonuses based off your armies make-up. Swords beat Pike, Pike beat horse, Horse beats Archer etc. But it is very hands off after moving units in to the area.<br><br>But the game shines when it comes to the economic sim. Building multiple supply chains, figuring out what merchant will make the most of his run, specifically defining his route and what goods he will trade. It is all done very well. And look beautiful. This game is fun for the people it is designed for. If you want a Total War redux, look some where else. Even against the AI it is challenging and figuring out the optimal routes is fun.<br><br>I am no expert, and I feel I have only slightly broken in to this game. But since I came home from a night out and saw all the negative reviews, I feel I have to chime in. The game is fun.

This game has a lot of potential and while I agree it maybe kinda pricey compare to some of the older games with a very similar genre this game still have its own merit to make it stand out from the rest. Now let me list down some of the things that you should know before purchasing this game;<br><br>1. THIS GAME IS NOT TOTAL WAR - thats right, some of the screenshots might a little bit misleading making some players to believe that this game is similar to the franchise that is Total War. I must warned you first that this game is not about total war but more on trade and economic warfare that an all-out battle between soldiers.<br><br>2. THIS GAME IS NOT A POLITICAL SIMULATOR - the politics in this game is rather abysmal and frankly for me personally is kinda disappointing as there is really not much for you to do when it comes to politics; other than the occasional declaration of war and trade or any other sort of agreements between neutral and hostile cities\/players. It is really simplified to the point where if you are to do any agreement between you and the AIs, all you need to do is pay a sum of money according to the amount of population they have. Disappointing yes, this is one thing I hope will change in the future.<br><br>3. THIS GAME IS NOT A CITY BUILDER \u2013 too often I see people complain about the fact that there is little to no choice of placement of buildings within the city compared to the likes that is Civilization\/ Banished etc so let this be warning to you: This is not a city builder, in fact I would think this is more of an empire builder than anything; you get WILL get the choice to place where you want you city to be, you WILL also get to choose what buildings you want to build in said city, BUT you WILL NOT get the choice of where you want said building to be place at in said city. <br><br>THIS GAME IS A GREAT TRADE-EMPIRE BUILDER SIMULATOR! In fact I would say it shows a somewhat perfect way of what capitalism is all about. Now I\u2019m not here to talk about politics, I\u2019m here to talk about the game itself. One thing great about this game is that really challenges you to make use of what confined land you are given\/ spawned in and how to make use of said land\u2019s natural resources. <br><br>As you may already (or not) know, there is 20 resources that you must take advantage of in order to make the money that you need to expand your trade empire. To acquire said resources you must build businesses that will generate the resource that your city is geared for. Another thing you must also take note is that the MERCHANTS in this game that you HIRED are completely in it for their own profit. They will not work like a mindless drone controlled by some human player on what and what not to buy for no profit for them at all. (Though if I am not wrong there is a way for you to do that after researching a technology) They WILL go and buy whatever they think they could make some form of profit from and WILL SELL it to any FIRST CITY they go to that they THINK THEY CAN SELL FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE. Of course where the merchants goes to is completely controllable by the player but how and what they is mostly determined by the merchants. You can control this somewhat by controlling the trade route that you set them in manually or by building the warehouse and designating the resources you want them to stockpile for resale in another city by another merchant. This may seem very complicated at first but after playing it for awhile (or reading the guides that some of the community has made) you will eventually get the hang of it. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement and may be for everyone.<br><br>Warfare in this game though pretty much boils down to a numbers game with a simple rock-paper-scissors format where archers beats swordsman, swordsman beats spearman and spearman beats horseman. Maintenance of the troops is also somewhat a problem in the early game where you have no money as the troop\u2019s payment is rather high and note that you must maintain the troops with supplies from your nearest city as well giving them a range penalty on how they can from your empire. Most of the time a spam of mercenaries would be enough for most situations, only at times you will need to have a small contingent of elite troops such as knights and the likes. Another thing you should not is that certain units are regional base and can only be hired at certain regions. There will also be the occasional raids by bandits and the likes where you can build an archer tower to kinda counter it. A problem I have with this would be the large attacks of wild animals like bears and wolves which the developer has will looked into.  There is also a naval warship and the likes but it\u2019s pretty much the same as the land. <br><br>So here\u2019s the indepth review\/ preview of what this game is really like. Now some might argue that this game is unpolished and is set up for future overprices expansions but basing it off on Kalypso \u2018s, the most expansive it should be would be around 20 dollars and below. Now I\u2019m saying it based on SGD (Singapore Dollars) pricing so I\u2019m not sure what it would be you monetary terms but I\u2019m sure if they do make it so pricey it would be worth it. Take a look at Patrician IV: Rise of a Dynasty. It\u2019s a pretty pricey amount for a DLC but hey it was worth it.<br><br><br>NOW FOR ALL THOSE WHO SKIPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE, HERE\u2019S THE SHORT VERSION OF IT:<br><br>Pros:<br>Stability \u2013 No crashes so far, all in all pretty stable even on the highest settings and when Alt-Tabbing in and out.<br><br>Music \u2013 I personally love the music in this game, Nice and soft medievalish music<br><br>Graphics \u2013 It\u2019s actually better, in my opinion, than the Total War games map view and less laggy compare to their newer games. The troop details are not as extensive as Total War though.<br><br>Gameplay \u2013 Campaign in this game is a good combination of basic tutorials and open campaign gameplay. Though be warned, it will still take a while to get used to as they do not explain every little detail to first time player. Trade is a big factor in this game and even more so than war or anything else for that matter. Do not be deceived by the Screenshots and trailers talking about war in this game as it is nothing more than a rock-paper-scissors numbers game. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement where trade is biggest factor for victory and is definitely not for everyone.<br><br>Cons:<br>Bugs \u2013 Like any game out there, there will be bugs. Currently there is a bug where you builder will start upgrading the road only to stop halfway even when you have all your necessary resources needed. Another bug is the occasional resource missing bug where it will say that there is a missing resource.<br><br>Wildlife \u2013 Attacks by wildlife is ridiculous at times as there will be times they will spawn 4 to 5 Bears hunting down your merchants as you trade. It really breaks the immersion. One way I counter this is to build a couple of towers around the roads where they attack and manned them with archers.<br><br>Warfare \u2013 Like I said earlier and I cannot emphasize it enough, it is nothing but a numbers game with a rock paper scissors format. The only other way to do war is to blockade the cities with ships\/ sieging them with troops and starve the city out with something like a timer where troops on both side will die as the game progresses.<br>I'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18438709', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18438709' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18438709\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18438709' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18438709\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18438709', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18438709_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18438709_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19739689\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198091954259\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"131688531\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f1\/f13c80160b640fc7d70fb6f1db0bcd5542a287a9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f1\/f13c80160b640fc7d70fb6f1db0bcd5542a287a9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f1\/f13c80160b640fc7d70fb6f1db0bcd5542a287a9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198091954259\/\" data-miniprofile=\"131688531\">\u0412\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0430 \u0428\u0442\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198091954259\/games\/?tab=all\">16 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198091954259\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198091954259\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">65.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLikes:<br><br>It is a grand strategy covering medieval European (not entire world) history (not fantasy). A BIG Plus for this. Not too many new games like this - Attila and only partially Crusader Kings 2 and Civilization V.<br><br>Cool graphic. I wished that CK2 had it like this. Very good solution. You have strategic view but you can zoom in and you see a city into the details (no need for separate window). I would only like more variety, more faces, more colours and flags and most importantly that developers add different cities look for different regions. And I would prefer if the characters and soldiers were less comic drawing and more reality shots. Bonus plus, that humans are scaled to fit everything else on screen, enough with those giant soldiers covering entire city.<br><br>It is a complex game not too easy to learn, yet not too hard.<br><br>Dislike:<br><br>Overly agressive AI opponents, for my taste, for a game like this. Large minus. <br><br>Not too many difficulity levels. Three. There is no one for the beginers, easy or so.<br><br>Things that I like to be more improved as mentioned in upper part of the review, were I wrote about better part of the game. In another words, it is published earlier than it should be. But I guess that seems to be a standard nowdays, with majority of the games, unfortunetly. However all that can be added latter if the developer continue to maintance the game.<br><br>Overal, I recomend the game.<br>I wrote this, just to give support and incourage making of more games simular like this.<br>Allthought I am not sure if anyone will read this. :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19739689', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19739689' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19739689\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19739689' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19739689\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19739689', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19739689_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19739689_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23389631\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198026327285\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"66061557\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198026327285\/\" data-miniprofile=\"66061557\">sirkadrix<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198026327285\/games\/?tab=all\">46 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198026327285\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198026327285\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">253.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGrand Ages is really fun for the first hour or 2 of game play.  I really like their concept of the trade routes and getting goods to all my cities.  The problem I see for this game is that after you've got a few cities and have obtained all the trade goods it becomes very repetative.  Build a few cities and create a trade network among them and repeat.  If it was possible to obtain more numerous and more rare trade goods to add to the network it could be more challenging and more interesting.<br><br>The military aspect of the game is very simple and unimaginative.   You build a bunch of troops and throw them at the enemy.  You have almost no conrol over your troops once in combat so battle tactics and strategy aren't much of a factor.  It quickly becomes very tedious once you go to war.<br><br>Im dating myself here, but it almost reminds me of Caesar 3.  Really feels more like a low complexity city builder than a Grand Strategy.  This game has alot of possibility, but just needs some fine tuning to make it replayable.  Replayability is where this game really falls short.<br><br>I give this game a 5 of 10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23389631', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23389631' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23389631\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23389631' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23389631\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23389631', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23389631_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23389631_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t48 of 67 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18418841\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"130024421\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1ddd8cd5c721532c9ae3ebc2f2465468a9ea3304.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1ddd8cd5c721532c9ae3ebc2f2465468a9ea3304.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1ddd8cd5c721532c9ae3ebc2f2465468a9ea3304_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"130024421\">Segata Sanshiro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/games\/?tab=all\">354 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/segata-sanshiro\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game seems to have gotten a bit of a bad rap. Coming from someone who has played a lot of Paradox games, Civilization and the like, I can safely say it's not a bad game.<br><br>However it's not as good as it could have been, and that's what seems to have annoyed a lot of people. All the groundwork is there for this to be a truley spectacular game, but it just falls frustratingly short. Falling back to clich\u00e9 car analogies - it's like someone took the time to design and make a very beautiful sports car, but did the interior lazily with some bad IKEA furniture at the last minute.<br><br>It's missing that extra finish, those few extra mechanics which make the game far more fun and engaging (this could be anything from a political system, to more building options, etc.). Hopefully the devs will add this kind of stuff in, because it has so much potential to be a great game, but at the moment it's just a bit shallow.<br><br>Also the game runs flawlessly on Linux ;).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18418841', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18418841' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18418841\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18418841' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18418841\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18418841', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18418841_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18418841_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t55 of 82 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18236044\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"1337190\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/9241587b99a082fec81dc49327e48b26717afa64.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/9241587b99a082fec81dc49327e48b26717afa64.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/92\/9241587b99a082fec81dc49327e48b26717afa64_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/\" data-miniprofile=\"1337190\">Deritus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/games\/?tab=all\">372 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197961602918\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst off, this is an economy game. The trailer is misleading. Take a moment, let that sink in...<br><br>Right then!<br><br>The combat is extremely simple; Total War this is not. _Do not buy it for the combat._ It's also a bit fiddly and could use a little improvement for what is there, but it boils down to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a ratio control. Have a lot of archers vs a lot of melee and no horses? Bonus to damage, and so on. It's a game of balancing the combats, and numbers. Pure, simple, numbers. If you can field and finance more than the other guy, you'll likely win.<br><br>Overall, it's more akin to Patrician than many others I've played, though there is a bit of a Hegemony vibe in there, and a bit of those progress quest-like games too. Numbers, numbers, more! MOAR! <br><br>The trading is the main point of the game: setting the towns up and picking production to create profitable routes, and expand your empire. Grand Ages: Medieval, however, takes a little bit different of an approach. Instead of being able to micro everything, you're controlling the macro. There is no placement, there are no trees to worry about. You plonk down a business, and once it generates some workers it's off an running. Additionally, you can't just make a bunch of traders and have to worry about paying them - you get 1 per city (though you still have to pay 'em.)<br><br>It's all about the routes, and the various ways you can set those up. It's oddly engrossing to sit there and constantly tweak what's going on, and I've caught myself losing hours to it.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18236044', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18236044' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18236044\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18236044' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18236044\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18236044', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18236044_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18236044_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30822055\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048164461\/recommended\/310470\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"87898733\">bransonaacm<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 29\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's really a good game in my opinion. perhaps it's not popular for some people is simply because it's not like a total war game and has more to do with running a kingdom and focusing on trade and commece rather then building armies and waging war on other kingdoms (which you can still do on this game). my only problem is the dlc's don't seem to show up in the steam store.

It then allows you to hire merchants and tell them to buy in one city and sell in another, like the Patrician series. Finally it allows you to recruit military regiments and tell them where to go and attack or defend in real time, which, as far as I know, is an innovation in this kind of game. <br><br>These three elements plus a very light diplomatic element make up the entire game, which means the game is an experiment, an attempt to expand on previous sucessful formulas. As such, it fails, for I don't believe these elements can work together, not even in future installments, to create a new sucessful formula. This is probably because each of the elements was simplified, indeed, almost abstracted away, in order to make them all fit in the same game, to the point where the game involves very little startegy, be it in the city planning, trading or military aspects. To win you just have to expand more quickly than your opponents, which means you get more money and resources, which means you can feed more troops, which in turn assures you will win the automatic realtime battles.<br><br>I think the game is fun enough to warrant one playthrough, howerver, so I'm recommending it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28357780', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28357780' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28357780\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28357780' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28357780\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28357780', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28357780_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28357780_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/310470\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1,354 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["18187343","19184589","19437552","18242855","18197409","18438709","19739689","23389631","18418841","18236044"]}
