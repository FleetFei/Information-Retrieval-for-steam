This review will, as much as possible, only deal with the DLC. As my setup does not use any network connections, they won't be mentioned in this review. I will be talking about both the story content of the adventure as made by WOTC and the conversion from book to software by Smiteworks. For the review, only the main program, the 5E SRD, and this DLC are active.<br><br>My setup: I host a face-to-face D&amp;D game using FG. We have a PC running the software with the monitor as my DM screen, and we have a TV laying horizontal for players to use their miniatures on battle maps. Everything they players have access to is display only- they are using pencils &amp; paper, real dice, miniatures, real rulebooks, etc.<br><br>Lost Mine of Phandelvar (LMoP) is a good adventure that will take characters from level 1 to level 4-5. If you plan to play this as a PLAYER, please - don't read this review.<br><br>**THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW**<br><br>This DLC is the &quot;introduction&quot; to D&amp;D 5E adventuring. It is simple to both run and play, even for inexperienced DMs and players. It contains a little taste of most of the types of experiences that will make up larger campaigns. There are dungeon crawls, diplomacy\/role-playing encounters, a bit of sandbox &quot;what do you want to check out next&quot; play, chances of recurring villains, memorable NPCs... even a dragon. Secret doors, traps, hidden treasures, and lurking monsters will teach players to make sure they don't tunnel vision the obvious goals. If played to their potential by the DM, there are several encounters that will act as a wake up call for players, as they come to realize that level 1 characters are just starting their journey (and are fragile!). By the end of the adventure, the characters and players will have saved a small town from numerous threats, becoming local heroes in the process.<br><br>The Good Things (adventure):<br>- Simple to run. I spend a couple of hours preparing for what's likely to happen during that session. Mostly reading through the chapter a few times or tweaking individual encounters, I've changed almost nothing in the adventure as far as the story goes.<br>- Simple to play. The adventure starts off with a dungeon crawl, which is a great way to let my players get comfortable with the game. Teaching them combat in 5E is incredibly easy, and learning it made my players visibly more comfortable and involved. As they got more encounters under their belts, I've been able to introduce more rules gradually.<br>- Short. As an introductory adventure, being able to take bite sized pieces each session and still feel like they have been accomplishing something in the big picture is extremely important. There is time enough for the large campaigns later, this is the perfect scale for beginners.<br>- Well written. For the most part, the settings are described well, the NPC roster has several that are quite memorable, the story flows well, and the adventure makes sense. The town feels like the movie Tombstone, and it's easy and natural to flavour the Redbrands after the movie's Cowboy's.<br>- IT HAS A F@#$ING DRAGON!! This game isn't called Dungeons and Kobolds for a reason. Dragons are such an iconic feature of this game, and to see one in an &quot;introductory adventure&quot; gave me goosebumps as I planned out how I would play him. These are more than just stat blocks, after all. Having the dragon talk instead of immediately attack, luring them into the tower, letting them become more relaxed as they dropped their guard... the look of dawning horror on their faces as the dragon grinned and inhaled was priceless. &gt;:)<br>- Contains 5 premade characters- 2 fighters, a rogue, a cleric, and a wizard so that the players can immediately begin their adventure. Some of these characters have direct ties to the adventure in their backgrounds.<br><br>The Bad Things (adventure):<br>- Easy to TPK. The very first encounter, if played by a DM not pulling punches, can make the party nothing more than a stain on the ground. Bugbears can 1-shot many level one characters. The Dragon's breath weapon deals 12d6 damage, which can 1-shot some level 3 characters even if they made their save.<br>- Scattered information. I'm assuming this fault lies with the original adventure, not the conversion. Needed information can require more searching than it should.<br>- Players maps divulge secrets... sort of. Looking at the key of the player maps, they will include icons for a &quot;trap&quot; or &quot;secret door.&quot; Even though they don't tell the players WHERE those are located, the fact that they are in the key tells the players that they exist somewhere in that map.<br><br>The Good Things (software)<br>- It includes the entire adventure. Text, maps, artwork, everything. This is not a stand-alone software, the base FG program is required, but it is pretty plug and play other than that.<br>- Each encounter has it's own page. This generally includes relevant background info, a text box for the brief DM description of what's going on, an NPC roster, NPC tactics and personalities, and a parcel link for any treasure to be found from that encounter.<br>- Battle maps have pins, clicking them opens the relevant encounter which makes navigating the adventure a breeze. The maps are also high enough resolution that even spread out over a 40&quot; TV they still look very sharp.<br>- Tweaking Encounters is easy. Adding\/removing NPCs, adjusting stats, changing map starting positions, etc are all easy to do. I've had to adjust difficulty both up and down to suit my group.<br>- Changing Tokens. This gets its own point. Sometimes it is a basic picture, such as the dragon, and other times it is just a big circled letter, such as &quot;S&quot; for Sildar. You can find a huge collection of tokens, both for sale and for free, to replace these with. Going from an &quot;S&quot; to a top-down view of a battered prisoner adds a lot more immersion than I would have thought.<br><br>The Bad Things (Software)<br>- Typos. Holy smokes, the typos. Problems such as formatting adding line breaks in the middle of a sentence, missing punctuation, or just simple mistakes in spelling take up a fair amount of my prep time to fix. Spending a couple hours proofreading the adventure text should not have been a step that got skipped.<br>- Dead Links. There are some dead links in the various pages. A thorough proofreading \/ bug testing would have easily caught these. Example: NPC sheet for Hamun Kost, &quot;Other&quot; tab has a spell list. All of these links lead to blank pages.<br>- Links to other Modules. Some links point to other modules, without specifying what modules it is trying to get to. Example: Under &quot;Items&quot; -&gt; &quot;Magic Items&quot; -&gt; &quot;Scroll of Augury&quot; is the link &quot;Image:Spell Scrolls.&quot; Clicking that link brings up an error message: &quot;Could not open sheet with data from unloaded module. (*)&quot;<br>- NPC sheet errors. Some obvious errors in some of the NPC sheets. Example: Daran Edermath, under his &quot;Traits&quot; it lists: &quot;Rock, null Commoner&quot;<br><br>All of these are quality control issues that should have been fixed before releasing this product. (I'd be happy to do this for any 5E module in exchange for a fixed copy of that module!)<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>This is money well spent. For $20, you can allow a group of players to get the perfect sized adventure to get a real taste of what D&amp;D 5E is (only the DM needs this DLC). They'll encounter dungeons, town gossip, large areas of wilderness to explore, monsters ranging from trivial to deadly, creating and advancing a character, and how brains can develop a rich and exciting world, with each person adding their own touches to the evolving story. The bad things about this module, although annoying, are really not a big deal over all.<br><br>Remember, this REQUIRES the full version of Fantasy Grounds to play. As well, I highly recommend buying The Players Handbook (either physical book or the FG version) to really build your character. The included options are quite limited.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25033937', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25033937' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25033937\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25033937' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25033937\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25033937', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25033937_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25033937_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["17073211","17735115","25033937"]}
