I thought this was going to be a bit of a bog-standard train sim with VR bolted on. Not the case, this mixes simulation with more game-like puzzle elements and makes good use of room scale VR.<br><br>If you\u2019ve ever played that train puzzle in the old PC game \u201811th Hour\u2019, where you have to shunt train carriages around a closed circular map with various sidings to get the carriages in the correct order then you will get the idea here, only now there are more elaborate controls, a strict time schedule and it\u2019s in first-person. However, worth noting that different gameplay aspects and tasks may be added in the future as this early access game develops.<br> <br>Figuring out what to do and how to drive the train is also part of the enjoyment, clipboards and items are scatted in the driver cabin, which you will need to examine then to discover what to do, there is no intrusive tutorial mode, which I think suites the simulation aspect of the game.<br><br>The train cabin itself fits room-scale neatly, although there is a seated option where you can jump to the key areas of the cabin with a button press, however, in room-scale you wonder around the large driver cabin to get a good view of your surroundings, operating various aspects of the train and switch junctions remotely.<br><br>Just experiencing the train trundling along and looking out at the views of mountains and lakes etc. in VR is enjoyable enough in itself, let alone partaking in the games actual tasks.<br>The simulation aspect also throws into the mix, the fear of a derailment, losing all your hard work up to that point. Taking a bend to fast or going too quickly over one of the more rundown bits of rail track can cause some dramatic departures from the line. The rundown tracks also highlight a real-world feel about proceedings; the train model itself has a grimy workhorse look to it, adding to the emersion.<br><br>My only criticism is a bit unfair, as it is a free, early access demo, so it does not feel like a complete experience as of yet. It could do with a bit of spit and polish, more detail in the scenery for example, but these are all things sited as coming improvements if the game development pans out.<br><br>Mixing train simulation with good room scale VR and a time based puzzle aspect has made this a unique VR experience and one that gets steadily challenging and requires planning. What you get right now, out the box for no cost, is more than some of other paid-for VR experiences I\u2019ve been through. I\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing what lays ahead with this one, and I urge everyone to give it a go, as you might be suppressed as to how much you enjoy this unique game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30046684', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30046684' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30046684\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30046684' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30046684\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30046684', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30046684_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30046684_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/588530\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 3 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30046684"]}
