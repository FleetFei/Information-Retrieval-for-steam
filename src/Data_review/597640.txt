The gameplay is fun and quirky, the upgrades are well explained and the buccaneers for your ships come with some interesting bonuses.  There is a good amount of strategy and it's interesting to balance your own ship stats against an opponent before a fight.  Overall I really, REALLY enjoyed playing this game and even didn't mind the lack of a volume slider because the music wasn't playing at an obnoxiously high level.<br><br>What I REALLY disliked about this game was the lack of explanation, I started up skirmish training and was met with the map and pretty much told to just go for it, no idea as to what I was doing or able to do.  If you're going to include training or tutorial (which really every game should have at least the option included) then TELL US HOW TO PLAY YOUR GAME.  Tell us what we can do, how we can play, and how we can score points!  There is a video tutorial but I really don't want to sit through a video and try and remember everything from it when I start playing the game.  Explain the different aspects of the game as we go through step by step for the first 5-10 minutes and then leave us to play.<br><br>I spent over an hour in the skirmish training, defeating enemy ships and settlements, upgrading and expanding but when game over hit due to ... time allowance??? I had 0 points at the end!<br><br>Something else I really disliked is that the game doesn't save your option for fullscreen, so everytime you load the game you start in windowed mode, and this added to the problem of me ending up capturing an HOUR of the OPTIONS SCREEN instead of my gameplay.<br><br>These are all things that should have been hashed out during TESTING rather than rushing out to market.  However the issues with recording don't hamper gameplay, it's a personal gripe as I really wanted to upload a video and praise this game for it's good points while pointing out how they could better optimise and tweak the game for the gamers.<br><br>It's not a bad game, it's overpriced for what you currently get, and really what you get is an online only game.  You can either &quot;LOAD GAME&quot; &quot;JOIN GAME&quot; or &quot;HOST GAME&quot; the only single player aspect coming through skirmish training, not even story or mission modes.<br><br>Anyway, my advice is to wait for this on a bigger discount and make sure you have friends who buy it too for it to be worthwhile.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/BiBUkPln_ms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/BiBUkPln_ms<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30409522', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30409522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30409522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30409522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30409522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30409522', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30409522_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30409522_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/597640\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30409522"]}
