You are given 3 nodes under your control and each enemy is given 3 nodes under their control.  The goal is to defeat the enemies by taking over or destroying all elements under their control.  To do this you are given various abilities to affect the state of the board and the enemies also have abilities of their own they can use against you.  As you level up, you can unlock new abilities and fight stronger enemies in an RPG style progression system.<br><br>Things I enjoyed the most:<br>- In-depth gameplay allowing for many different interactions<br>- RPG system allows for replayability by choosing different skills in different games<br>- Presentation is thematic and game assets feel like they belong in the same game.<br><br>Things that bugged me:<br>- 5 elements, each with 5 different interaction methods made for a steep learning curve.  Some are intuitive like water destroying fire, but others are not, like wood destroying earth.  It does keep to the Taoist philosphy of Wu Xing though.<br>- Steep difficulty spike at level 8 when anger is introduced, which is the first enemy that aggressively attacks you<br>- Enemies typically seem too dumb or too smart.  Some boards seem unwinnable if you get multiple of the hardest enemies<br><br>Overall I recommend it if you are into playing a strategy game with complex interactions.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30865196', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30865196' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30865196\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30865196' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30865196\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30865196', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30865196_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30865196_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30940249\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">genkipro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/games\/?tab=all\">3,920 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/\">130 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/575670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Five Elements for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Five elements is a casual puzzle game about meditation and enlightenment.<br><br>I can't really remember the premise, since it's basically irrelevant to the gameplay, but from memory you play a warrior seeking training in meditation from a monk to reach enlightenment. The game is played inside your head as you meditate to overcome the enemies within you. Pretty cool, hey?<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Graphics - Graphics are stylised and abstract. The whole game is set inside your mind, and battles are represented by icons of differing colours and animations, which you connect via glowing energy streams. The graphics are functional such as they are, but Five Elements isn't a game that you'd leave on 'attract mode' to show off your new graphics card.<br><br>The interface is simple and functional in game, but seems rather messy on the main menu screen. For example, I couldn't work out if there was a way to replay a level. Some more useful tooltips wouldn't go astray either; I'm getting sick of entering the help menu and clicking and dragging around to find out what Metal does to Earth, or whatever.<br><br>There are still-image hand-drawn cut scenes at certain points in the game to present the background story. These are relatively well done, but feel a bit unnecessary.<br><br>There are no graphics options beyond resolution and full-screen \/ windowed mode. Windowed mode doesn't even work properly; windows of certain sizes don't scale the interface, so for example, 1280x1024 on a native 1920x1080 screen cut off large sections of the interface. The configuration menu has a graphics quality option, but the only selection is 'Advanced'.<br><br>Sound - Music is slow and calming, as a game about meditation should be. I didn't find it annoying, but I also wouldn't rush out to buy the soundtrack if one were available. Sound effects are suitable to the gameplay, with nothing unexpected. There are no voices.<br><br>Gameplay - Five Elements includes a tutorial to gently introduce you to the core concepts. This is mostly well done, but afterwards I was still left feeling a bit lost as to how I should best proceed.<br><br>The game is played in a series of levels as you battle with your negative emotions: sadness, anger, etc. Each level presents you with a small number of orbs of different elements: fire, water, earth, metal, and wood. Some of these begin under your control, some are neutral, and the remainder are under control of the enemy emotion. The goal is to take over all of the enemy orbs, by directing the elemental flow from your controlled orbs. Each element interacts with each other element in specific ways, though, so often you'll need to use one interaction to change an orb to a different element before it can be used effectively against the enemy.<br><br>Each level earns you experience points. Once you have enough of these you advance to the next level, which provides you with points to improve your abilities, including increasing the level time limits or unlocking new spells: cooldown-based abilities that you can use on each level to affect the course of subsequent battles.<br><br>Enemy emotions have different tendencies, adding a bit of interest to the different levels. Typically that translates to enemies becoming more aggressive as you progress. There are no penalties for failure, though, other than lost time; experimentation is thus encouraged.<br><br>Ultimately, though, each level reminded me a lot of the previous one, and after a couple of hours I'd had enough. I imagine I might come back to it every now and then, as is the nature of casual games, but it's a shame there isn't a bit more variation in the game as you progress through the levels.<br><br>I also noticed when the game started that I was immediately confronted with some poor grammar. Apart from that, the relatively limited writing in the cut scenes seems fairly good.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n-------------------------------------PROS &amp; CONS------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Pros:<br>+ Original setting and take on the old paper-scissors-rock game<br>+ Fairly well produced<br>+ Steam Achievements<br><br>Cons:<br>- I found it hard to remember which element was which, and what each interaction icon represented. Textual tooltips would have been useful.<br>- Becomes rather repetitive fairly quickly<br>- Main menu interface was unintuitive<br>- Store page mentions Trading Cards, but they don't drop<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Five Elements is a fairly basic casual strategy game, but it's mostly well made and doesn't try to do too much. It seems like it would be well suited to mobile platforms, but on PC I'm not sure it does quite enough to garner wide-spread appeal. Recommended if you're after a laid-back casual strategy game, and don't mind spending a bit of time memorising the element interactions.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">5\/10<\/div><br><div class=\"bb_code\">For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/curator\/10405952\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a>!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30940249', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30940249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30940249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30940249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30940249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30940249', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30940249_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30940249_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/575670\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30865196","30940249"]}
