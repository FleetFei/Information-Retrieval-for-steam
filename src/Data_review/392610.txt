Pick it up if you are looking for an original puzzler to challenge your mind in new ways.<br><br>The &quot;pure&quot; refers to the focus on the puzzles. There is no story. There is a sort of biochemistry theme, but aside from the visual aesthetic, there's not any &quot;actual&quot; biochemistry going on here (so don't worry if that wasn't your favorite school subject). The visual &quot;biochemistry&quot; presentation is quite nice, unique, and carefully crafted (surely no small feat to program).<br><br>The gameplay is a sort of turn based resource management. The game is split into maps, which are split into several single screen levels. For each level, you must figure out how to get from the initial configuration to one satisfying the level requirement (producing some amount of tricone).<br><br>Although the puzzle mechanics are turn based in essence, the presentation is not static. The pieces you can interact with float freely inside of cell structures in real time. You interact with them by clicking and dragging - which does convey a sort of feeling of playing with microorganisms.<br><br>The mechanics are elegant, logical, well designed, and clearly introduced. There are three basic categories of pieces you can interact with: resources, catalysts, and compounds. Drag resources onto catalyst receptors to generate compounds. Compound pieces can be activated to manipulate the cells or other pieces.<br><br>I'm not aware of any other games quite like this, although it reminded me vaguely of working out chess puzzles. The mechanics are of course quite different, but there is similarity in satisfying a goal condition from a starting position using a set of pieces via a sequence of moves.<br><br>Like other resource management games, as well chess problems, the process is primarily deductive, but trial and error can sometimes be used as a crutch to a limited degree. The mechanics of tricone lab are quite clever, though, and require a higher degree of &quot;lateral thinking&quot; than most resource management games.<br><br>I am quite pleased at how tricone lab made me think in new ways (&quot;lateral thinking&quot;). This is very valuable to me in a game. I did find myself getting stuck on some levels a few times, but I moved on to other levels or took breaks, and eventually was able to get through all of the standard levels on my own, and felt quite good about that. Having the achievements to commemorate that is nice too ;)<br><br>The play time through the standard levels is roughly 10 hours, but will vary quite a bit up or down depending on how readily you pick up the mechanics.<br><br>The game includes a good level editor, and thus hopefully there will be quite a few more levels to play later on (there are already a few user maps that are quite decent).<br><br>There are a few rare glitches (and a common one), but none are gamebreaking - just a bit annoying sometimes. Hopefully these will be fixed eventually, but they hardly alter my positive opinion of the game at this point.<br><br>While technically still in Early Access, the game is complete and the difficulty is quite well tuned at this point. If interested and price not a factor, there is no reason to delay.<br><br>Disclosure: I received a free copy expressly without any obligations.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21957900', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21957900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21957900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21957900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21957900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21957900', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21957900_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21957900_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21831273\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"23297973\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fa2bc6e7bd1b75ae7e853e00000c450f88d7a6f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fa2bc6e7bd1b75ae7e853e00000c450f88d7a6f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fa2bc6e7bd1b75ae7e853e00000c450f88d7a6f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/\" data-miniprofile=\"23297973\">T-wRecks<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/games\/?tab=all\">4,426 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/T-wRecks\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: I was given a key for this game by the developer. It was expressly not in return for any consideration other than general non-review feedback. But since I've enjoyed it, here we are.<br><br>Tricone Lab is an untimed puzzle game. The setting is a view of stylized cellular level organisms, presumably looking through a microscope in a biochemistry lab. In each level, the object is to produce a specified quantity (generally 1-3) of a &quot;molecule&quot; called Tricone. This is done by moving red, blue, and green cone objects into the same cell as a catalyst object. There are many other objects that can make this process easier or harder. There are objects to break cell walls, to make new walls, to transport objects through walls, components to make other objects, to break things down into components, etc. So each level is about using the resources you have available to get the right quantity of cones through the present cells to a catalyst. I find the puzzles to be quite well designed.<br><br>If I had to pick a game to compare the mechanics to, it's probably Divide by Sheep. Both have a fixed quantity of resources that you have to carefully maneuver around the level to get them where they need to go. And both are very solid games.<br><br>Don't be concerned by the Early Access tag. While still technically a beta, this is a polished, fully working product. The core levels are already done, with possibly some slight future changes to get the learning \/ difficulty curve right. And with a level editor, the developer is also hoping to build up some user submitted levels. But in my opinion, the Early Access designation could be removed today and the game would be fine.<br><br>Story: You're making a molecule called Tricone from cells. Presumably in a lab. That's it and that's fine. It's a puzzle game, not a visual novel, adventure game, or grand rpg.<br><br>Visuals: Minimal 2D, but fitting the game. Cell walls are black with grey, black, and white backgrounds and resources. The exceptions are the cones and Tricone, which makes them stand out as the main objectives. The cell walls are a bit squirmy to sell the concept.<br><br>Sound: Also minimal but fitting. It's just a few short bits of music and sounds that sound unobtrusive and vaguely scienceish. Feel free to play your own music.<br><br>Length: I'm currently at 6.5 hours, about 85% through the stock levels. The remainder will probably be slower, and I suspect I've been faster paced than most will be to this point. There are also a couple of sets of user created levels available now, with more presumably being added over time. And you could choose to create levels. Update: I finished the stock levels (and got all of the current achievements) in 9 hours. It sounds like that may be on the quick side.<br><br>Difficulty: Challenging, but I've never been really stuck at any point yet. So in a nice spot for me. Others milage may easily vary.<br><br>Achievements: Straightforward, simply for completing each set of stock levels. 100% the stock levels and you'll get all of them. Possibly subject to change as it is Early Access, but the end result should be fair and reasonable.<br><br>TL:DR: I like it and recommend it.

Then, there is the geographical challenge of matching math to shape and space, in puzzles crafted by hand. <br><br><b>Geometric Interface\/Graphics<\/b> <br>Most puzzle games are on a grid, which is much easier to program. But, Tricone Lab\u2019s cells are floating, amoeba-like structures that gradually change shape while you play. As you pull and drag lines, and the nodes interact with one another, it looks like drawing with a pencil. These long projections can become quite comical when structures called \u201canticatalysts\u201d start grabbing the nodes you needed to complete the puzzle. Some cells have positive or negative charges, and that may break down larger units you have constructed, all in all causing you to laugh, or cry depending on the difficulty of the map. It certainly brings to mind Dante\u2019s various levels of paradise, purgatory, and hell, all in one game.<br><br><b>Gameplay: <\/b><br>The interface looks like a cell body floating in space. Within the cellular bodies are nodes, or individual puzzle pieces that work in very specific ways. These pieces have functions; as in movement, transport or carry, cloning, charge (+-), breaking cell walls, and slightly larger templates. The templates are to be pieced together with correct nodes to form more powerful tools. A standard level starts out with a variety of these nodes subdivided in different compartments of a cell. Somewhere in there are colored cones and a Tricone template. The goal is to connect one of each of 3 color cones to a template and form a \u201cTricone.\u201d All of the other pieces are to help you get the cones together with the tricone template.<br><br>The parts are constructed using formulas that are available by simply pressing the \u201cDescribe\u201d button when any node is selected. The formulas are not only visible at all times, but they are rarely complex. The complexity is more an aspect of the number of nodes, and the number of node functions. <br><br>The game has 23 maps. Each map has from 3 to 5 levels, making a total of 100 levels. The menu places the maps in alphabetical order at the moment, but that will probably be changed, because 4 of them are labeled as demo maps. It is best to pick these out to play first, as they are like tutorials, and are out of order: Balance, Breakers, BreakerMaker, and Tricone. The most difficult maps are all at the end, and are locked until completion of all the previous maps. <br><br><b>Math &amp; Logic<\/b><br>Within maps, the levels progress in difficulty, but most are solved quickly. In the locked levels, the \u201cboss level\u201d for each map is often difficult and may be quite time-consuming to complete.  They require higher-order thinking skills, and you must first analyze, then synthesize to complete those locked levels. My (adult) son became absorbed in the game over my shoulder and ended up downloading the game himself. He\u2019s progressed much faster through the levels than I have, even though I spent many hours in-game while he was at work, just trying to keep up with him.<br><br><b>Narrative: <\/b><br>The puzzles are wrapped in the narrative shell of a human cell. Without a written story, you are left to picture and experience the puzzles as if you were inside a cell performing the functions of cells. It becomes almost a metaphor for cellular biology. You basically have a math game inside a science game.  I honestly see no cons to this game. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d<br><br><b>Pros: <\/b><br>+ All of the puzzles are hand-crafted (no randomly computer generated levels) <br>+ The game includes a level editor for sharing your own maps &amp; levels in the workshop <br>+ Higher Order Thinking skills are demanded to complete the more challenging levels. <br>+ Challenging for all ages <br>+ One man developer is active in the community and responds to screenshots, workshop levels, and will accept feedback.<br><br><b>Cons: <\/b><br>- Tricone Lab is still in early access and may change over time.  <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">I recommend this game for those who enjoy spatial math puzzles. <\/div> As of now, I\u2019ve finished 85\/100 levels, lacking mostly the boss levels for the last few now unlocked maps. These will take me quite a bit longer, though some gamers could probably complete this game within 9-12 hours.  With the \u201cPaparazzi\u201d map I\u2019ve submitted to the workshop, &amp; the user levels I\u2019ve downloaded, I\u2019ve already spent 25 hours in this fun &amp; challenging puzzler. I\u2019m sure I will spend another 25, so the game is definitely a fun use of time and I would rate it a 9\/10 in the Puzzle genre.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22108469', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22108469' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22108469\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22108469' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22108469\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22108469', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22108469_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22108469_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19443374\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48471325\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d2597473ec3dfec70ded609495bb2fb5446904.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d2597473ec3dfec70ded609495bb2fb5446904.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d2597473ec3dfec70ded609495bb2fb5446904_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48471325\">fantis6<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/games\/?tab=all\">3,747 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/recommended\/\">83 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fantis6\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 2, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTricone Lab is a puzzle logic game where your goal is to  move elements and finally build a tricone. For this you should combine 3 different colors. The whole game plays in a microscopic organism. The game has a very interesting gameplay mechanism. You are changing the cell structure, breaking down cells etc, doing anything to reach your goal. The most useful thing in game is your logic, as the game requires some thinking from the start, and then new and new things needs to be used to solve the levels. It will force you learn to think in a more and more strategic way, it will get gradually harder as you learn the new features. The game have a minimalistic style. The game also features a level editor, so we can create our own levels and share it with the  community, and of course you can play community created levels as well.<br><br>So my verdict<br> <br>+a lot of levels<br>+level creator<br>+community shared levels<br>+interesting gameplay and concept<br>+simple and clear design<br>+steam achievements<br> <br>-if you don\u2019t like thinking after some levels can be frustrating for you<br> <br>So this is interesting puzzle game with unusual concept. If you like puzzle games, thinking and want to develop your strategic thinking and patience then it's a great game for you.<br><br>8\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19443374', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19443374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19443374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19443374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19443374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19443374', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19443374_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19443374_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22054768\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">Orge Lambart<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/games\/?tab=all\">7,698 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/\">109 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImagine for a minute, you have the ability to shrink down to a microscopic form, enter a microscopic space ship and enter the body of a sick person..

I'm not talking about the movie innerspace with Dennis Quaid (prior to getting old and becoming a drunk,,, ok I don't know Dennis Quaid is a drunk, I think I was talking about his brother Randy Quaid)  and Martin Short...  (Has somehow managed to maintain a career after his stint on Saturday Night Live, not to be confused with Jon Lovitz, who failed to have a long career and was last known as the man who was mistakenly identified as being deceased, when he was actually still alive)... <br><br>Where was I at again?  Oh yes the game Tricone Labs, a unique Puzzle game, designed with the thought of allowing you to interact with a microscopic organism.. Nothing says amazing game like manipulating \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ism, (intentional misspelling. the answer is YES!!!)  This game has a very simplistic style, you solve puzzles by completing the Triforce.. (Zelda reference, will probably fly over the heads of many PC gamers.. since we've never been blessed with a zelda game..).  The gameplay is simplistic but the puzzles aren't, even the most accomplished puzzle game player will be baffled, and find hours and hours of challenge.  <br><br>The game will require you to use your mental prowess to get through stages, the increasing difficulty was a breath of fresh air, I was quite thankful that my hand wasn't held the entire way through.<br><br><b>Pro's<\/b> <br>Challenging<br>Simplistic game play,<br>Decent length to fully finish the puzzles<br>Level Editor<br><br><b>Con's<\/b> <br>a bit repetitive<br>music can be a bit annoying<br>achievements seem to be broken (didn't unlock for me..)<br><br><b>Overview<\/b> <br><br>This is a must have for puzzle game lovers, if you enjoy sitting down, and using your mind to analyze and figure out a puzzle you'll love it, it will challenge even the most seasoned puzzle game enthusiast.  If you can't sit still for 5 minutes, or like my cousin Vilo have ADHD or, if you're idea of a good video game is an FPS shooter, fist pumping, and saying woo, woo woo, this game probably won't be for you.  If you suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, you may very well find this game amazing.  It'll give you something to compulsively obsess over..  I'd suggest picking it up, playing it, beating it, and donning some underwear on your head, a white twin throw sheet around your neck, picking up a plastic sword and calling yourself Louis, because you'll fell like Louis Skolnick when he mounted Betty in the classic movie Revenge of the nerds..  NO playing this game doesn't make you a nerd, but gosh darn it, everyone knows Louis ascended from his nerdom, the moment he bedded Betty...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22054768', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22054768' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22054768\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22054768' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22054768\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22054768', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22054768_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22054768_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19728016\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"107625602\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/\" data-miniprofile=\"107625602\">Samurai Vader<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/games\/?tab=all\">5,052 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/\">100 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Summary:<\/div>Tricone Lab is a logic game about completing tricones in microscopic organisms. The idea seems original to me, only thing that concept reminds me (in a way) is SpaceChem - but don't worry, Tricone Lab doesn't have such high learning curve and it's immediate fun from beginning, with short and practical tutorials for every gameplay mechanism. Levels are balanced and everytime you start to get bored by repeating mechanics, a new one is presented.<br>A huge surprise comes with the Java engine that the game uses, because many indie Java-based games end up being buggy and not polished. This is not the case!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Positives:<\/div>- New gameplay mechanics introduced after every few level sets (with included a tutorial level set every time).<br>- 100 levels. And the game's yet only in early access, so we can expect more levels later.<br>- Nice and simple graphics that doesn't distract you from solving the puzzles.<br>- If you make a mistake, you don't have to restart the whole level. There are undo\/redo buttons.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Neutrals:<\/div>- Later levels may be frustrating for players expecting easy puzzle game - you can skip some levels though!<br>- <span class=\"bb_strike\">Steam achievements are only gained for unlocking new gameplay mechanics (completing levels) - there aren't any special hard achievements.<\/span><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Negatives:<\/div>- The price (11,99 \u20ac) for a puzzle game may be too much for some people.<br><br><br><b>Note:<\/b> I've got a review code for Tricone Lab directly from the developer.

Simply connect the pieces and you're done! Well, there are obstacles that make this a bit more difficult and tools you can use to circumvent them. The cell walls, borders, require <b>carriers<\/b> to carry each cone over or <b>breakers<\/b> to destroy the walls. These in term require their own parts to be connected to their own respected constructor catalysts and built before you can use them. There are more of these gadgets you can use, all of course after you build them, if there are enough resources floating around for that given puzzle of course.<br><br>Gameplay is well thought out and features an indirect approach to puzzle solving, requiring the player to gradually build up to the solution and crack the puzzle. Such a design choice equates to very satisfying and addictive puzzle solving. <br><br>Everything in the game is well presented to the player in a non obvious tutorial style so the player is familiar with every mechanic. Every map beaten awards the player with a key (and an achievement) representing their understanding of that mechanic. These keys are then in term used to access certain maps thus ensuring one can't play any puzzles using mechanics one does not understand.<br><br>Technically, the game runs fine and is without any performance issues. I did not run into any bugs. There is an easy to use level editor available and community designed puzzles can easily be downloaded and played. Artistically I did get tired of the grey and white color scheme quickly but for a one man dev team to accomplish such a well polished product, I can not complain. Took me 7 hours to beat the included 100 levels.<br><br>This is a hardcore puzzle game. Unique in every way, no story and no nonsense.

Many interesting mechanics in this game (break a cell wall to neutralize a negative charge in order to build tricone, or build up a negative charge inside the cell to break apart a tricone in order to clone its components, required when the level requires you to build several tricones). Strategy comes into play in later levels as you may have to use different tools provided to beat the level. For example, you may have to break down the walls of a cell in a certain order, to neutralize the cell, etc.<br><br><br>\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550<br>PROS &amp; CONS<br><br>Pros:<br>Mix of easy and challenging levels<br>Ability to design\/share levels (coming soon)<br>Interesting concept of a game (mixing biology and puzzle solving)<br><br>Cons:<br>Sometimes requires a lot of trial and error to beat levels<br>Not too much content currently<br>\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550<br>SUMMARY &amp; FINAL RATING<br><br>Solid and novel take on the puzzle genre.

The creator of the game gave this to me to try it out, but did NOT solicit a review.<br><br>I have played this I would say about half way through, so I have seen most (but not all) of the puzzle mechanics on their own, but I have only worked with them together for a little bit. From what I have seen, the game is very smooth and very clever. The game even contains what I would call convenience features that allow you to shortcut some procedures that could become tedious.<br><br>The gameplay is structured into discrete areas that, at the beginning, are dedicated to one mechanic each. If you have played The Witness, you will be familiar with this elegant style of introducing puzzle elements. As you complete these areas you earn a symbol that allows you to unlock other areas requiring that mechanic. So, as you complete multiple areas other areas open that require several of those mechanics to solve. Once I really got playing, the design and mechanics were so rock solid that I forgot it was supposed to be early access. I also appreciated that there the system for how things work remains consistent and true to what you have learned, but there are a few twists along the way that require you to experiment and think outside the box.<br><br>So, when I say that I have completed half of the game, it is only by level count. With most of the mechanics under my belt, the levels are ramping up in difficulty rapidly. So, if you feel that you are breezing through the game easily, wait... your time will come.<br><br>All in all, a truly excellent effort very worth adding to your library even if you are not a puzzle junky.

10 hours average completion time, 6 hours for those good at puzzles and 30 hours average maximum for the <u>base game.<\/u> You are also able to make your own puzzles and download levels that other players have made.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>Tricone Lab is a minimalist puzzle game where you create tricone molecules within a cell structure by bringing 3 coloured cones together with a tricone catalyst.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Breakers and catalysts and cones (oh my!). Tricone Lab exceeded my expectations. I opened up the game hoping to kill an hour or so with a few puzzles, and couldn\u2019t turn the damn thing off! It\u2019s challenging but also rewarding when you finally crack a puzzle you\u2019ve been stuck on for a while. There are 23 maps with 100 puzzles in total, each level having varying difficulty. In the earlier stage of the maps, the puzzles are pretty straightforward, being more about the basic understanding of how to use the different components within the cell. As you proceed, more resources are introduced, and you really have to think to work out the specific sequence that must be used. After completing some maps you unlock \u2018keys\u2019, which enable you to unlock the harder maps that contain the same new resources as the map you just completed.<br>Though the base game is amazing as it is, there\u2019s also the ability to download maps that other players have created, and even create your own (I really like that this option is available).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Difficulty &amp; Challenge<\/div>I\u2019m by no means an avid puzzler, but I do enjoy the odd brain teaser once in a while. The maps are pretty straightforward; once you grasp the concept of how to use all the resources, you\u2019ll probably find that it really is very simple. When there are multiple components within the cell to use, it can be pretty challenging to work out the sequence (there is however the option to skip puzzles if you\u2019re finding them too difficult). I found that in the puzzles I was really stuck on, it was just a matter of looking at them in a different way; thinking \u2018outside the box\u2019 so to speak. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Replay Value<\/div>In terms of the base game, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real replay value; once you\u2019ve completed the puzzles and know how they work, there\u2019s no point playing them again. This is mainly because each puzzle has only the one solution. Once the sequence has been worked out, it will lose it\u2019s challenge the next time you play it. Despite this, you can still download maps that other players have made (as I mentioned earlier), so you can always check back and see if there are new puzzles to crack! <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Achievements<\/div>The achievements can be obtained through completing the maps and also gaining the keys (essentially learning how to use a new resource).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall Verdict<\/div>Tricone Lab is seriously well made. I was never really interested in minimalist games, but this one is just fantastic. It\u2019s addictive, deceptively simple and a great way to either binge play (which I\u2019m totally guilty of) or just do a puzzle or two here and there. It\u2019s pretty decently priced honestly, and for what you get I couldn\u2019t recommend it more.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall Score: 9\/10<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25460925', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25460925' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25460925\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25460925' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25460925\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25460925', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25460925_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25460925_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24651974\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lothy\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"142767675\">Lothy<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Tricone Lab for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPartickhill Games brings us Tricone Lab, a deceivingly simple, quasi-minimalist looking puzzle game that will make you use all your lateral thinking abilities in order to proceed though the increasingly difficult levels. <br>In Tricone Lab you interact with microscopic organisms in what appears to be a cellular-like environment. Your goal? To create as many \u201ctricones\u201d as the level needs to let you proceed. Tricones are created by joining three colored cones (red, green and blue) into a master template, but several things will get in your way: not only the membranes, but also other organisms that might either aid or hinder you in your quest to complete the levels. <br>The graphics of the game might be quite simple, but there\u2019s a certain charm to the simplicity of the game, and I greatly appreciate the almost monochrome tonality of most of the game, for these type of puzzle games tend to end up in bright colors to make up for the lack of \u201cproper\u201d graphics. Not here! The graphic style seems to fit perfect with the game. <br>The music and sounds are pretty good, almost relaxing, I rather enjoyed them even if I kept them at a very low level. <br>Playing it is simple enough \u2013 you mostly will use your mouse to connect things and navigate, but there are also keyboard shortcuts should you not want to go entirely with the mouse. <br>The levels, as I\u2019ve already stated, appear to be quite simple when you begin, but as you progress they get increasingly difficult, and often times I would get stuck by not thinking things through properly before launching into what looked like a simple puzzle, but ended up being something more\u2026 even when the difficulty was marked as low. So the game really makes you pay attention to what you\u2019re doing.<br>There are neither tips nor guides in-game (there are tutorials though, like with every puzzle game, introducing you what new items do), though I\u2019ve found often the level names are tips on their own.<br>As you get through the levels you will unlock keys that will allow you to open even more levels for a whooping total of 100. Yes, you read that right. Tricone Lab boasts of 100+ levels, and if that were not enough for you, they also have a level editor. You can upload any maps you create with it, and others will be able to play them. Can you see the possibilities here? I can.<br>And the game is still in development! <br>Tricone Labs is an entertaining, challenging game that, although it might not be a graphical masterpiece, is truly worth your time. I\u2019m the kind of person that gets easily frustrated with games, and I have to say, while I did get stuck here and there, Tricone was never stressful nor frustrating to play through. <br>Do I recommend it? It\u2019s a sound YES! You\u2019re sure not to regret the purchase.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24651974', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24651974' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24651974\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24651974' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24651974\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24651974', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24651974_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24651974_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short23572010\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ElectricWolfGAME\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"188601821\">Electric Wolf Game<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Tricone Lab for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI had a lot of fun playing this!

Warning though, one slip up could make you restart!<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EELTch5ok5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EELTch5ok5U<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23572010', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23572010' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23572010\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23572010' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23572010\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23572010', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23572010_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23572010_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22212014\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Jragghen\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"32271119\">Jragghen<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: I was given a key by the developer due to my having enjoyed other, similar games, which was a first for me, and was pretty cool. :) No request was made in exchange for this key other than general beta-level feedback. This review is simply because I genuinely enjoyed the game.<br><br>Tricone Lab is a 2D puzzle game where you seek to create a certain number of &quot;tricones&quot; by joining three individually cones into a catalyst. A variety of obstacles may be in your way, whether barriers, other catalyzers which will steal the cones, or needing to transport\/clone\/etc various tools in order to establish the final set of cones necessary in the proper location. A few of the levels are quite difficult, but there's an excellent series of tutorial levels which ramp the difficulty in a way that allows you to explore each newly-introduced mechanic.<br><br>The game is still in early access, and there's a few known bugs on the forum which are getting ironed out, but none of the ones which I ran into are gamebreaking or mess with the experience whatsoever - typically a graphical glitch, or the like, which can be solved by reloading the level.<br><br>The game has a complete set of authoring tools, allowing users to create their own levels which can be shared via the Tricone Labs website. <br><br>All in all, it took me roughly 5 hours to complete all the levels that came with the game, and it left me wanting more - I'm actually trying my hand at making a level or two right now, which is something I practically never do, and as I got the game for free, I bought an extra copy to gift to a friend, which is some of the highest praise I can offer. If you enjoy puzzle games, this is likely right up your alley.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22212014', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22212014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22212014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22212014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22212014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22212014', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22212014_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22212014_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22152515\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wirdjos5\/recommended\/392610\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"49545193\">Wirdjos<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Tricone Lab was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTricone Lab's aesthetic is based around cellular biology, so it's fitting that solving its puzzles would feel organic. Maybe it's the way all the individual parts undulate and wander about or maybe it's the fact that nothing can be moved, only combined or separated, but every part seems to have a life of its own. They all want to return to order, to be rearranged so that the tricone can be formed. Each new piece is introduced one at a time, in its own series of levels. That tutorial, if the process can be called that, lasts for about half the game. But because each piece has presented its own distinct motivation so well and the end goal of any puzzle is so simple, the entire game becomes completely modular. Pieces can be positioned in almost endless variety making the inclusion of a full level editor an act of great foresight. Community maps, which appear to go through an approval process from the developers, are already being made and are extending the game with a creativity that only crowd-sourcing can produce. This is a good thing; for though the official levels are a full taste of what Tricone Lab has to offer, a taste often leaves one only wanting more, as it does it in this case.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22152515', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22152515' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22152515\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22152515' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22152515\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22152515', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22152515_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22152515_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/392610\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 53 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30609106","21957900","21831273","22108469","19443374","22054768","19728016","24363985","19065032","24399688"]}
