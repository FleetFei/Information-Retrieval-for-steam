They magically appear and disappear, but in a slow seamless way, and these ghosts are not trying to scare you in the since of a quick spook, but more in the way that they're watching you, and you see them doing they're own thing rather than to stupidly scare you, it's what I'd like to call a cool scare.<br><br>The game looks great by the way, yea it's just simple plain colors with simple structures from the looks of it, but with nice lighting, great affects, and 'not' crappy models with a great amount of them, it all combines together to make great scenes to look at. I also want to give extra credit to the team for making small quality details like books with readable titles and good quality pictures on them, and having me think that the environment I was in feel like it was lived in before, just from look at rooms and finding nice notes.<br><br>Speaking of notes, the game is filled with just enough story content like notes and voice recorders, that it kept me interested in that story throughout my duration of playing the game. Some these notes were mostly interesting to read, but some are part of, what I feel, the environment as a means of making the world\/ship believable, which was kind of cool. The voice recorders are awesome, with great voice acting, and ones that are unique with how everyone has their own thoughts and personalities, but they all share the same despair and downfall. So the story, in all angles, is great.<br><br>Going to gameplay, you start off with a laser gun with unlimited ammo, so scavenging for resources of any kind is not necessity, which I'm kind of happy about, but I'm not against having them if done correctly in a game like amnesia. The gun play in the game is decent but a bit jittery when zooming, although I haven't found myself zooming much, firing from the hip was more optimal. You have to look for items to collect, and usually place them in other areas or machines, fix broken machinery, and maybe find some clues to open locked optional doors for added content like a different gun.<br><br>What I like about the whole experience that the game throws you into the game with no hand holding of any kind mostly, as in no tutorials, no objective markers, nothing, you have to figure it out with the notes in the game or audio log, or just plain figuring it out. That can be viewed as a negative also, but for me It's an alright thing to put in (or not to put in) as the stuff you have to do is not insanely hard, it's manageable.<br><br>Overall I had a great experience playing Spirits Of Xanadu, I'd even compare to Alien Isolation, obviously not in graphical power, technicalities, or gameplay elements, but in story, atmosphere, and voice acting, all of them being low level nice qualities, but a worthy comparison to note. The asking price can be argued upon, as the game isn't long, but it is a great experience, for me I'd say 10$ is its sweet spot, but I'm not against the original price.<br><br>Shameless <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/ksalue.com\/_\/review\/my-thoughts-on-spirits-of-xanadu-review-r727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >link<\/a> to original post.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15060729', 'summary' );

There is a vessel that has gone silent for some reason. You are sent to the vessel to assess the situation and then fix anything that needs to be fixed to assure that the vessel will return to earth properly. The difference is that in Dead Space, this is just some explanation for getting you on board the ship full of aliens so that you can start shooting aliens. Sometimes a guy on a radio tells you to fix something and you press A to fix it. But in Xanadu, you actually have to like\u2026 figure out how to disable the rogue turret outside the engine room, then disable it, then break into the engine room and look at the engine to figure out why it\u2019s not working, which is partly obvious (replace fuses, unjam the cogs, etc), but it also means performing some quasi-Myst-like gameplay where you fiddle around with knobs and switches and buttons until something interesting starts to happen.<br><br>There are also audio logs and text notes you can find, as well as computers you can log onto to read emails and such, which fulfills the part of the mission where you\u2019re trying to investigate what happened. But the weird thing is\u2026 and this is coming from a guy who nearly always HATES audio logs and note pages\u2026 I actually am really enjoying finding them and reading\/listening to them?<br><br>They are actually really well written (and the VO is not bad at all), and there is an interesting element of the story that adds an interesting quirk to a lot of the messages. But I also like that the logs and stuff you find aren\u2019t just exposition dumps. You also find the sorts of notes and things that people would actually write down. You might find the recipe for an omelet, or a scrap of paper on which someone has simply scribbled down the Konami code (ha ha). One of the audio logs was made by one of the crew, who got really drunk and basically just drunk dialed his voice recorder. I literally laughed when he starts talking about his girlfriend\u2019s hair for some reason and about how it looks \u201cvery Roman\u2026 like the hair a Roman would have\u201d. The sort of weird, incomprehensible babbling your drunk friend would actually say.<br><br>The most obvious sign this is an adventure game though? I've never played a shooter where I had to get out a pen and paper to SOLVE ONE OF ITS PUZZLES. But you will have to do that at least once here. Don't be scared, though. The puzzle quality is very good. Just remember to be very thorough.<br><br>Using my own scale below, I give <b>Spirits of Xanadu<\/b> a hearty 7!<br><br>I WANT MORE GAMES LIKE THIS.<br><br><b>7) A classic, essential, and\/or must-buy game that is worth full price.<\/b><br>6) A good game that is worth the full price.<br>5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.<br>4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.<br>3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.<br>2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.<br>1) Avoid at all costs.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20062512', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20062512' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20062512\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20062512' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20062512\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20062512', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20062512_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20062512_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15106402\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/revisor\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"72503132\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f654ee8114a21343a4357efb632f5405c5d3e49b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f654ee8114a21343a4357efb632f5405c5d3e49b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f654ee8114a21343a4357efb632f5405c5d3e49b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/revisor\/\" data-miniprofile=\"72503132\">Revisor<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/revisor\/games\/?tab=all\">487 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/revisor\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/revisor\/recommended\/312230\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 29, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDon't be discouraged by the graphics.

You start the game on a small recovery vessel making it's final docking approach on the <i>Xanadu<\/i>, and once aboard it you have nothing more than a flashlight, a laser pistol and your wits to complete your task (although technically you could never pick up those two items and complete the game in complete darkness without shooting anything).<br><br>There is no hand-holding or tutorials or explicit guidance given. Period. The puzzles are simple, the map is small, there are only be a few weapons to collect and a handful of enemy types to fight, but discovering what happened to the <i>Xanadu<\/i> and completing your mission entirely through your own actions makes the whole experience feel surprisingly rewarding. <br><br>The atmosphere of this game is something to behold in and of itself, though, and it's carefully crafted by a combination of the impeccable presentation of the mystery of the <i>Xanadu<\/i> and the game world's immersiveness. You discover the details what happened to the <i>Xanadu<\/i> primarily through tape recordings made by it's three former inhabitants which are scattered around the ship, hidden, but put in logical places. There's even poems and notes that you can find that add even more intrigue and flavor to the narrative but the recordings truly are unforgettable. These personal accounts of the crew's self-destruction and are believable, well-written, and incredibly well voice acted. As you listen to these voice logs, playing through the game slowly becomes more and more tense as you learn about the what caused this cryptic tragedy and realize that, soon, you too will suffer their fate. This ambience is pitch perfect for me: unsettling and bleak but not outright terrifying or unbelievable or depressing (in other words, it's almost completely devoid of any melodrama).<br><br>The interior enviroment of the <i>Xanadu<\/i> perfectly complements the storytelling of the game in order to make its atmosphere so absorbing. No detail inside the <i>Xanadu<\/i> is out of place besides the occasional easter egg. The interactivity of the enviroment, while oddly limited in some ways, is, overall, realistic, and the limitations prevent it from being distracting or superfluous (this is not a Visceral Cleanup Detail rip-off). The various living spaces, amenities and utilities all feel like they are necessary components of this vessel. All together, they give an important sense of realism as you explore the ship which keeps the whole game experience grounded despite the game's minimalistic visual aesthetic and ominous mood. It should be noted, too, that while thorough exploration is necessary for experiencing everything all this game has to offer, its small scale prevents any serious tedium in this endeavor.<br><br>The only real problem with the immersion of the game is that the design of the enemies and how you fight them is not nearly as interactive as the enviroment they inhabit. Each one attacks you in their own, singular, boring way, and you just have to shoot them to kill them (except for the security drones which you can shut off if you can sneak up behind them). One enemy type, which I call kamikaze robots, are especially frustrating to deal with because their one attack pattern is to run up to you and destroy themselves and you with a fatal explosion. It's nearly impossible to stop them before they get within arms reach since they have plenty of health with no weakpoints, they run faster than you, and most areas of the ship are quite confined and free of obstructions to outsmart them with. A seperate but related issue in the immersion is that some of the enemies (including the aformentioned kamikaze robots) are somehow capable of <b>respawning on a derelict ship in space for no reason<\/b> and the debris from potentially infinite encounters with these respawning enemies causes performance degradation over a playthrough.<br><br>All in all, this is a great indie game that can engage you with it's enigmatic and disconcerting atmosphere and make you think. Even if it's light on the play-time and mechanical depth, it can be just enough to make a lasting impression on those that play it.<br><br>EDIT: Added much, much, much more detail.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17007429', 'summary' );

However, between some dated graphics, clunky UI, and some design choices that did not survive the test of time, I just didn't get the experience I was looking for.<br><br>So, I am happy that Spirits of Xanadu scratches that particular itch.  It is a moody FPS adventure set in an alternate timeline where humans were a space-faring race in the early 1980s.  SS2 has been distilled down to its essence.  The control scheme is simple enough that a ham-handed gamer like myself can't mess up too badly when I inevitably wander into a room patrolled by the ship's hostile defense system.<br><br>Performance has been a bit of an issue for me.  My main gaming computer is a laptop, which doesn't help.  However, the developers have thoughtfully included video options that are accessible from within the in-game menu.

The puzzles were stimulating yet not contrived. The System Shock style of documents and logs sprinkled around drew me into the mythos, and the vagueness of the &quot;enemy&quot; was excellently executed in the storytelling.<br>However, in the end I felt short changed by the non-descript endings and short play time (I got 2 of 3 endings in under 3 hours). While I enjoyed the intentionally vague storytelling, I didn't find much to think about after the endings. There's not much in the way of play variety since there are few enemies or environmental challenges to overcome. I'm not the type to replay a game for the sake of achievements, so I don't see myself revisiting in the near future. In short, the game oozes ambience but feels a little too light for a $10 game. If it were $5, I would recommend it in a hearbeat.<br>Overall, I had high expectations and was somewhat disappointed, but still thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely keep an eye out for future games from Good Morning, Commander.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23509998', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23509998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23509998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23509998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23509998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23509998', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23509998_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23509998_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30066416\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mariskadeville\/recommended\/312230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"29024553\">MAriskaDeville<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7TL-tIGaDY4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/7TL-tIGaDY4<\/a><br><br>I don't really think I would class this game as horror, although it does have very slight psychological horror elements in the story telling. <br><br>But that aside the game is mechanically competent, the graphics are decent and the price is good. Also worth mentioning is the voice acting delivered via audio logs, which is excellent throughout. The gunplay is functional, but its not really the core of the game so I don't hold that against it. Also the puzzle elements are pretty light, and nothing too taxing. <br><br>Biggest gripe is how short the game can be - once you know what to do, and where to go you can speed run it in less than ten minutes.

Well, you'd get Spirits of Xanadu.<br><br>Without a doubt this game will satisfy a bit of that itch you may have waiting for the system shock 1 remake that is currently in development. ( <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/systemshock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/systemshock.com\/<\/a> ) But it is by no means going to satisfy you entirely. The atmosphere in SoX begins with the typical scenaro of having a shipwide blackout due to a power issue. It sets the tone nicely with some bizzare insanity effects and hallucinations but stumbles over itself in several places due to counter-productive design. For example, every time you 'die' you respawn in the Brig which is right next to the bridge so you sometimes find this as being helpful. This respawning mechanic actually sucks a ton of the tension out of the game and makes it less enjoyable in some ways but also mercifully less frustrating at others. I'm talking of course of the suicide-bots. In system SS2 style, all the robots in the game will respawn even in areas you have previously cleared and this helps the game to maintain the tension even when revisiting parts of the ship. But the design of these bots is really not very balanced. Can you outrun them? No, they run as fast as the player. Can you gun them down while back peddling? Almost. The only way to survive is to actually run to a gravity-elevator or find a raised platform but both of these means of escape are rarely available on board the Xanadu. <br><br>In short, unless you encounter them at quite a distance then you're almost certain to die. This really needs to be adjusted because they become a real pain. But as I said, the respawning mechanic is a blessing when it comes to these kinds of deaths. Also, the creepy atmosphere is lost once you restore power to the ship and then it becomes far less tense. I'd actually go so far as to sugget the developers patch this to go from the shipwide black-out to dimmed emergency lighting which will maintain the atmosphere but allow you to see more clearly than the flashlight allows for alone.<br><br>The storyline is delivered in typical SystemShock\/DeusEx style with you discovering written logs, audio recordings and even post-it notes scattered around the place. Furthermore the developers have been devious enough to really require the player to think hard in order to achieve some of the more difficult puzzles. Speaking of the puzzles, they are nicely varied and not simply a 'find key, take key to this area - rinse and repeat' which often plagues many FPS puzzle games or walking simulators. To give you one example, you come across a whiteboard with some engineering notes and some numbers written in two columns upside down. This doesn't mean much at first until you notice a nearby room with certain systems offline and on the panels are buttons with numbers that, when pressed, sum together to produce a voltage. Put simply, the whiteboard tells you what voltage each subsystem needs and you need to do a little math to figure out which buttons produce the correct total. It's not rocket science, but its a nice brain teaser and produces that pleasing 'Ah ha!' moment when the solution to puzzles suddenly come together in your mind. SoX does this many times and does it very well.<br><br>Visually the game won't win any awards but this is certainly one of the times when the gameplay itself is the greatest appeal. The voice acting on the audio logs themselves is fantastic and the storyline, while not very original, is presented in a way that is entertaining. My only complaint is that the strong language used in one of the audio logs was completely unessersary and when its being shouted at the top of the actors voice you really have to wonder why the developers felt that was required. Thankfully I was playing the game with my headphones on because my children were in the room and they hear enough of that kind of language at school.<br><br>Spirits of Xanadu currently retails for a reasonable price of \u00a37 and, although I picked it up on discount, I would honestly say it is worth the normal asking price if you don't mind how short the game is. There are two different endings which adds to the replay value but you are really going to have to work those brain-cells to achieve the 'failed mission' ending. I really hope we see more from this development team in the future because they have some really talented people on-board.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29307678', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29307678' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29307678\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29307678' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29307678\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29307678', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29307678_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29307678_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29234867\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198018706338\/recommended\/312230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"58440610\">Undead_Fanatic<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main thing you need to know about this game is that it is very minimalist.<br><br>The game drops you in, gives you a mission and then you're on your own. You have to read notes, listen to audio logs and explore each room carefully or you might miss something. There's three endings although the terms good and bad don't really apply to any of them. So long as you investigate everything, it's pretty clear what choices will lead to which of the two endings. The third ending is more obscure but it might be sublte insult.<br><br>Gameplay is quite simple. Combat isn't too challenging so long as you don't play like an idiot and run blindly into rooms filled with enemies. You have to save at terminals but they're evenly spread out for the most part. Although the few times I did die, it didn't seem to do anything. Some enemies respawned but some small enemies respawn on timers so who knows if death had anything to do with it.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed my time with it. There were two times I got fairly frustrated and didn't know what to do but I backtracked a bit and found what I missed so I'm not upset at the game for it or anything.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29234867', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29234867' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29234867\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29234867' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29234867\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29234867', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29234867_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29234867_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29062398\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thepcgamer101\/recommended\/312230\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"102548183\">ThePCGamer101<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine <\/div><br>Spirits of Xanadu is one horror game, out of few, that I like and enjoy playing, because it focuses on atmosphere, music, story, and narration with nice voice acting, but aside from all that, it's good horror game in my eyes because it uses the atmosphere and its environment to inject fear in you<br><br>How this game does it's thrills is, again, it's great atmosphere, and how the enemies that want to kill you are all in their place, doing their own thing, and will attack you because they saw you, not because they know exactly where you are, and they won't magically appear in front or behind you to cheaply scare and kill you, like most other horror games do<br><br>Another great thrilling aspect about the game that makes me fearful of it, is how they do illusions by letting you see these space ghosts from time to time while exploring the ship. They magically appear and disappear, but in a slow seamless way, and these ghosts are not trying to scare you in the since of a quick spook, but more in the way that they're watching you, and you see them doing they're own thing rather than to stupidly scare you, it's what I'd like to call a cool scare<br><br>The game looks great by the way, yea it's just simple plain colors with simple structures from the looks of it, but with nice lighting, great affects, and 'not' crappy models with a great amount of them, it all combines together to make great scenes to look at. I also want to give extra credit to the team for making small quality details like books with readable titles and good quality pictures on them, and having me think that the environment I was in feel like it was lived in before, just from look at rooms and finding nice notes<br><br>Speaking of notes, the game is filled with just enough story content like notes and voice recorders, that it kept me interested in that story throughout my duration of playing the game. Some these notes were mostly interesting to read, but some are part of, what I feel, the environment as a means of making the world\/ship believable, which was kind of cool. The voice recorders are awesome, with great voice acting, and ones that are unique with how everyone has their own thoughts and personalities, but they all share the same despair and downfall. So the story, in all angles, is great<br><br>Going to gameplay, you start off with a laser gun with unlimited ammo, so scavenging for resources of any kind is not necessity, which I'm kind of happy about, but I'm not against having them if done correctly in a game like amnesia. The gun play in the game is decent but a bit jittery when zooming, although I haven't found myself zooming much, firing from the hip was more optimal. You have to look for items to collect, and usually place them in other areas or machines, fix broken machinery, and maybe find some clues to open locked optional doors for added content like a different gun<br><br>What I like about the whole experience that the game throws you into the game with no hand holding of any kind mostly, as in no tutorials, no objective markers, nothing, you have to figure it out with the notes in the game or audio log, or just plain figuring it out. That can be viewed as a negative also, but for me It's an alright thing to put in (or not to put in) as the stuff you have to do is not insanely hard, it's manageable<br><br>Overall I had a great experience playing Spirits Of Xanadu, I'd even compare to Alien Isolation, obviously not in graphical power, technicalities, or gameplay elements, but in story, atmosphere, and voice acting, all of them being low level nice qualities, but a worthy comparison to note. The asking price can be argued upon, as the game isn't long, but it is a great experience, for me I'd say 10 EUR is its sweet spot, but I'm not against the original price<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> RECOMMENDED :) <\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29062398', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29062398' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29062398\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29062398' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29062398\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29062398', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29062398_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29062398_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/312230\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 192 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30343199","30827230","15060729","20062512","15106402","17007429","20551814","15068159","15680090","23509998"]}
