I'm enjoying this, as I've enjoyed this game, but I'm well aware that it's not actually much complete content to get excited about. It's riddled with inaccuracies, it fictionalizes what it can't get the license to, and the roster is a jumble of actual Cup Series drivers and those from other series. These are all things that I personally find endearing and exciting, but it's really not hard to see where it'd dismay most casual customers.<br><br>To begin with, this offers a menu toggle that allows you to do single-player quick race, championship, and career modes with the updated roster. No multiplayer races, no challenges. Having some 2017-themed challenges would be nice, but with this being the first straight-up roster update to a NASCAR game that was additional content to an older one instead of a new separate product, I feel like there was a good chance we wouldn't be getting any content past 2016 if this car set wasn't pushed out the door just in time for the days leading up to the 2017 Daytona 500.<br><br>When you do play the races, you'll not notice any actual gameplay differences. Or, at least, I couldn't notice the AI behaving noticeably differently from their 2016 counterparts. All this changes is the roster, so that leads me to one central point here: if you aren't an active NASCAR fan, this really doesn't have much value to you. There are no gameplay additions here. This, like all of the rest of the DLC besides Challenge Packs, is purely cosmetic.<br><br>And you know what? If the names Daniel Suarez, Darrell Wallace Jr, or Erik Jones mean anything to you, if the 2017 Camry is something you just have to get behind the wheel of, and if you don't mind the Brickyard 400 lacking sponsors and just being named the Brickyard 400, that is fine. This banks a lot on the celebrity factor of &quot;wow, I'm racing against the real pack of drivers!&quot;, as have many racing titles in the past.<br><br>But that also leads to a bit of a contradiction. If you're invested enough to recognize these people and care about this, you're invested enough to notice a lot of things wrong. The roster being a jumble of non-Cup drivers is a fine break from reality; better to have drivers you know at all, right? Other issues crop up, though, such as some paint schemes being exact ports from 2016 with a new sticker on (DiBenedetto's car is Labonte's, Ragan's is Cassill's, etc.), others being pre-2017 concepts that ended up being entirely wrong (Nature's Bakery sponsoring Danica here despite a very public lawsuit between the two), and, while it doesn't show up in the actual gameplay much, the front windshield decals being inconsistent. In 2017, it's the series logo. In 2016, it was the driver name. Here, it's one or the other, or just entirely blank. Not to mention that this IS the 2016 ruleset, not the 2017 one.<br><br>And as it's now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, it should be noted that this time around, energy drink sponsors are uncensored and completely present by default. No age verification. None of the cars have alternate paint schemes, and considering the bloat present on the menus for 2016 when you've downloaded even just the free packs... that's refreshing, personally.<br><br>So, I dunno. If you're way into NASCAR and want a fictionalized attempt at recreating the 2017 season roster under 2016 rules, and don't mind some wild inconsistencies, this is a pretty fun cosmetic addition. You won't have to redo your speed ratings in either season, although career mode does not transfer and you'll have to run them both separately due to two events moving on the schedule. The trophies are the generic &quot;guy standing with wheel&quot; trophy for the most part. Sprint Cup billboards are still up everywhere. The new NASCAR logo isn't present. It's... something. I'm not sure I would have bought it, but having received it in a contest on Twitter, I can safely say I've still had a lot of fun with this, and it's added a new lease on life to my interest in the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30176560', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30176560' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30176560\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30176560' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30176560\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30176560', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30176560_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30176560_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30176560"]}
