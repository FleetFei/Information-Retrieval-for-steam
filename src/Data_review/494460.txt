So what if Dangerous Relationship was cheesy with an outrageously silly premise?  At least the writing was enjoyably fluid with a great translation by someone who's first language is clearly English.  Toss in plenty of humor to keep things from getting bogged down in melodrama, and characters who didn't feel like cardboard cutouts of every other otome character, and I really thought I'd found the first solid VN in Dogen's catalog.  And then things got bad, then downright atrocious before an oasis of amazing breaks out in the middle, then it slides right back to bad and ends on a disappointingly mediocre note.  <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=762211171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=762211171<\/a><br>I've become something of a fan of the &quot;celeb fantasy&quot; otome sub-genre, and quite enjoy the escapism of vicariously dating rich and powerful men through these stories.  There's truth to the idea that power is attractive, and that certainly holds true in these fantasies.  What I find most intriguing is how someone who has power and money can lose themselves when falling for someone of lower status.  Love changes people, even egotistical jerks, and witnessing that change can be quite fulfilling.  So, even if the plot is silly, characters derivative, and writing loaded with smut, if a character progresses from selfish prick to someone I care about, I can walk away feeling satisfied.<br><br>And so I dove into Dangerous Relationship with the hope of getting a little of that character progression I so enjoy....and I got it.  I also got the most infuriating, rage-inducing, disgusting character I've ever come across in a visual novel, and a few horn dogs who had nothing else going for them other than being horn dogs.   But it gave me Taiga.   <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=801606934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=801606934<\/a><br>For a company that rarely gives us anything deeper than &quot;tough guy is really a sweetheart underneath it all, &quot; Taiga is an anomaly.  He's the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 who never stops being an \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 even though he falls head over heels for the girl.  He's the guy who's changed by love, but doesn't lose the essence of who he is in that change, and that's something I've been waiting forever to see in an otome game.   What I find most incredible about the character is that he starts off in stereotypical fashion by forcing himself on the MC against her will (a running theme in this VN), but moves beyond that offense as his character develops.  Ultimately, Taiga is an insecure little boy who yearns for love and acceptance after past rejections have emotionally destroyed him.  He's this incredibly attractive fashion model who is constantly surrounded by beautiful people, and yet he only has eyes for the MC; not because she's perfect, not because the story demands it, but because she's seen the real Taiga and loves him for it.  It's a beautiful relationship that isn't based on appearances but on who these two people are on the inside.  That this caliber of storytelling comes from a Dogenzaka title astounds me.<br><br>For as much as I love Taiga's character, I equally abhor Kei's.  I can't even wrap my head around how anyone would find his personality appealing.  He's selfish, egotistical, masochistic and a complete sociopath.  His entire route revolves around him using the MC as a sex toy, which I admit may be appealing to a small number of readers who are into that particular kink; but even so, his personality is repellent even if you find yourself fantasizing about being abused in such a way.  I'm not lying when I tell you that there's a scene where he <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> damn near rapes her, and not in the &quot;she's thinking she likes it, so it's really not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665&quot; kind of way.  The guy ties her up and sexually assaults her while she's scared and crying.  That \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is NOT OK, no matter which side of the hemisphere you reside.<\/span><\/span>   <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=779278593\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=779278593<\/a><br>\/rage<br><br>The other guys are marginally better, although their routes eventually degrade into sex scene after sex scene, even nice guy Mr. Comedian, which was incredibly disappointing for me.  Too bad most of these characters' potential is wasted on non-stop screw fests (if only Ryouhei would've stayed chaste and innocent, he may have given Taiga a run for his money).   Make no mistake, Dangerous Relationship is as raunchy and risqu\u00e9 as any of the VN-maker's other titles, probably more so considering the amount of sex that happens in just about every route.  Fortunately, they mix things up a bit so that every sexual encounter doesn't feel like the same damn thing over and over again.  In the end, the VN really does feel like a vehicle for smut, so if that's what you're in it for, you'll probably be pretty happy.  At least the writing is creatively entertaining with descriptions that'll have you chuckling at times.<br><br>Ultimately, despite containing one of the most despicable characters I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing in any medium, I cannot bring myself to give Dangerous Relationship a thumbs down - you have Taiga to thank for that.  This truly is a situation in which a &quot;mixed&quot; rating would have served me well, but sadly, Valve doesn't seem to think it's needed.  <b><u>So yes, I recommend Dangerous Relationship with the caveat that it's essentially mediocre erotica with a surprisingly touching love story hidden amid the garbage.<\/u><\/b>  Take from that what you will.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26683382', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26683382' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26683382\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26683382' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26683382\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26683382', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26683382_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26683382_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26714386\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mifititi\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"336081411\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/498b6083db91a9d65cb99ea81a3c9e506800df03.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/498b6083db91a9d65cb99ea81a3c9e506800df03.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/498b6083db91a9d65cb99ea81a3c9e506800df03_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mifititi\/\" data-miniprofile=\"336081411\">Mifititi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mifititi\/games\/?tab=all\">51 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mifititi\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mifititi\/recommended\/494460\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCAREFULLY recommended.<br><br>I have mixed views about this game. Plot wise, some of the routes were a bit clich\u00e9 and had a typical twists for this type of genre. Since the player dates celebrities, it's given that the relationship has to be a secret. Still, I was a bit disappointed by the ends, even though I probably should have expected them on more realistic terms. Even so, the stories weren't bad nor particulary good. They were okay, despite all the clich\u00e9ness. Ironically, I liked the sequels, date scenarios and sub-stories more than the routes themselves. It helped relieve the bad aftertaste I got from some of the routes.<br><br>I must say, I was quite disappointed with the characters. Out of them, I absolutely HATED one character. For a romanceable character, he certainly had no romanceable qualities in him. At all. Three of them seemed like sweethearts and I expected them to be sweethearts - but I was mistaken. While they're sweet, there was one characteristic that they all shared and I disliked; they won't listen if you tell them no. However, one character was likeable and turned out to be much more than just what he first appeared. He's the only character that I can genuinely say I liked, besides the girlfriends of the MC. I liked them and the other non-hostile side characters more than the romanceable ones. That says a lot.<br><br>What drew me to this game was the art. I loved how colorful it was and it was really nice too. I especially adored Taiga's lavender hair... As for backgrounds, there's some fuzziness to them. I didn't mind particularly because they didn't really stand out to me.<br><br>English is not my first language, so I might have missed a typo, but I didn't see any or register them. That probably won't draw you away from the game.<br><br>The music was okay, but felt inappropriate for some situations. I don't typically &quot;hear&quot; the background music, unless it's either really good or really bad. Unfortunately, some situations were together with music that just didn't match.<br><br>Now, the biggest reason why I said CAREFULLY recommended. The issue with consent. No means NO. Most of the guys won't listen. If the MC wants it, then why say no? If she says no, it's a no. I'm not even sure what the MC really wanted, but I wanted pull my hair out so many times because I got so angry at the romanceable characters.<br><br>So, you could buy this if you're ready for all that. Because my first impressions of the characters were destroyed, I might be more angry than I'd normally be. The sequels and date scenarios helped me forgive the characters - if only somewhat - so that's why my opinion is a bit mixed. Take a risk with a game or don't.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26714386', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26714386' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26714386\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26714386' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26714386\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26714386', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26714386_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26714386_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25189758\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104326428\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"144060700\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b165698bb1b5ab32ca0eb160d8dc76e67c6cdac.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b165698bb1b5ab32ca0eb160d8dc76e67c6cdac.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b165698bb1b5ab32ca0eb160d8dc76e67c6cdac_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104326428\/\" data-miniprofile=\"144060700\">capitalradio<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104326428\/games\/?tab=all\">142 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104326428\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104326428\/recommended\/494460\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">18.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the 5th Dogenzaka Lab game that I've bought recently due to my new found obsession of otome games and the discounts that have been offered.

I've only noticed an extremely small number of uses of the wrong word (for example &quot;Once glance&quot; instead of one glance).<br><br>The good:<br><br>If you don't like bad endings then despite the name Dangerous Relationship, this does not offer a bad ending option.  Although Kei seems like one to me!<br><br>The okay:<br><br>I wish the male characters had just one more outfit choice.  They each have 2 and especially since the main character is a stylist the outfit choice doesn't always seem right.<br><br>There are only a few CGs to obtain.<br><br>I personally prefer the female main character to be drawn with eyes to make a more satisfying image.<br><br>There are a few story inconsistencies.<br>  <br>One route kind of fizzled out for me and lost my interest.<br><br>Overall:<br><br>It is a nice otome to add to your collection when this is on sale.  If you're not sure  you can always play the prologue and 1st chapters for each character on mobile or android.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25189758', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25189758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25189758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25189758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25189758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25189758', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25189758_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25189758_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25163925\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052385248\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"92119520\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fbd43ffa177f37408fbdb41fdd4cf7c7e6c8164.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fbd43ffa177f37408fbdb41fdd4cf7c7e6c8164.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fbd43ffa177f37408fbdb41fdd4cf7c7e6c8164_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052385248\/\" data-miniprofile=\"92119520\">GhostCat<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052385248\/games\/?tab=all\">119 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052385248\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052385248\/recommended\/494460\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA decent otome<br><br>Background and CG are beautiful.

That's not to say this isn't a great game, it is. This actually makes my top 3 for character-driven otome games.<br> <br>Character personalities: 5\/5 <br>Unique, engaging, creative, and very different from what you often see in otome. These characters are fleshed out and unique. They have fascinating backstories that create who they are today as people and it goes so far beyond the expectation of archetypes in an otome. Very attractive designs too with good variance between the characters.<br><br>Art: 4\/5<br>The art surprised me in how subtle it is. There are the most subtle sprite changes that REALLY convey the mood if you are paying close attention to them and how they shift. It isn't just the same 4 images recycled, it's subtle changes to those base images in the eyes, the plush, the eyebrows, the mouth..all that really tell a story through the character. The backgrounds are generic but they at least look the same. Many otome change so drastically in art style for the backgrounds you can really see how obviously stock they are. Here it feels more uniform. It's a shame none of the sprites seem to have shirtless shots though, there IS erotica and it's odd to read when the character is still bundled up in 3 layers of clothing.<br><br>Music: 3\/5 <br>It's not the worst I've heard, but it is generic and overused. Props for having some unique songs to certain storylines but all in all it's passable. Does a great job of setting the mood though.<br><br>Story: 4\/5 <br>This is a modern, slice of life, short otome. You can only do so much with that but even with that limited content Dangerous Relationship succeeds far beyond games twice its price. This is more of a character driven plot, but they work so well together that I don't mind that the plot isn't EXTREMELY fleshed out. The character motivations and unwrapping of the layers makes the plot stand out far more than most otome games do. And I might also add, it doesn't feel forced or generic. Even series I love like The Men of Yoshiwara are so heavy handed and predictable that it gets tiring. Dangerous Relationship does not fall into that trap and I find that extremely refreshing.<br><br>Side Stories\/Extra content: 4\/5<br>Same as story, it's more just character development and experiencing the characters more. The extra stories aren't terribly engaging as their own independent stories but they do offer more character exploration and I wouldn't have regretted buying any of them. I bought this on Steam so everything was bundled together, but had I bought this on mobile I likely still would have paid for the extra content and not regretted the purchase.<br><br>Erotica: 3.5\/5<br>I'm being generous here. Most otome's erotic is so much more limited than this, I'm giving it a 3.5\/5 rating COMPARED to other otome. It's got the same limitations you expect from an otome where everything is vague. But, depending on your storyline you get a lot more of it than you usually would from an otome. It's still fun and engaging even if a little limited for someone who likes a bit more. A 4\/5 rating may be a little more fair here but I play enough male-market dating sims to have a higher standard of sexual content than most otome can give. So I'm biased.<br><br>Favorite storyline: Taiga<br>Hands down. He actually has made my #2 spot of otome DS characters period. (#1 belongs to Rory from Voltage's Gangsters in Love). This was a spot held by Mamoru from Dandy Shot\/Pub Encounter for a long time but Taiga has enough interesting layers to his personality and such a unique personality that have to give credit where its due. He may seem a little tsundere at first but I promise you he isn't in the slightest, his rashness just comes off like that before you settle into it. He's open, honest, and uniquely himself. Unlike the usual bad boy or playboy archetype in otome, he doesn't change when he falls in love with you. He will remain himself to the end and that's something beautiful lacking in very single other otome I've played with this character archetype. He has such a fleshed out and interesting personality that I find myself playing his whole path again and again just because his character is so much fun.<br><br>Overall Value: 5\/5. <br>This game is cheap enough you shouldn't be passing it up. Even with its faults.<br><br>Best Audience:<br>This game is great for seasoned or new players to the DS genre. I think it sets a high standard that can lead to disappointment in other games if you're new, but it's still such a well rounded game I have no problem recommending this to everyone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25368131', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25368131' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25368131\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25368131' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25368131\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25368131', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25368131_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25368131_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28724969\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198339036360\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"378770632\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e7da2505cf9400c6bdb282d4b71b05f73075aa7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e7da2505cf9400c6bdb282d4b71b05f73075aa7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e7da2505cf9400c6bdb282d4b71b05f73075aa7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198339036360\/\" data-miniprofile=\"378770632\">Pix<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198339036360\/games\/?tab=all\">20 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198339036360\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198339036360\/recommended\/494460\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitley reccommend this game especially for the price I got it for in the steam sales.
