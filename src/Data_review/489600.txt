Topping, slicing, shanking, numerous air-hits, followed by that manic, overbalanced clubbing which so often results in one being corkscrewed into the ground. Oh, and let's not forget sand-fly fever, contracted from spending so much time in bunkers. It's all here, your lack of skill, indolent posture and flaky swing, all writ large, validated in code and preserved for posterity in your scorecard hall of shame...<br><br>HOWEVER, in other news, what a game! What a bloody-minded, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665rdly, haughty, flirty, discourteous fish-wife of a game. Those of you with the same dogged persistence and catalogue of ruined Sunday afternoons behind you will know what I mean. The course is there to be beaten of course, it never dangles too far out of reach, it merely requires a better class of player than you will ever be. But, on the right day, with the right club and sufficiently garish flannels, with that crushed drive soaring, arrow-straight, climbing, climbing, climbing into the azure sky... You are familiar, dear aspirant golfer, with the same trouser-tickle of achievement, the same dopamine hit that rivals any amount of luck at the roulette wheel. And, with the same unfailing regularity, the next spin will be a dud and the house wins. But this time it was different and - who knows? - next time may be different too.<br><br>In other words, this is not a golfing simulacrum that permits one to attain, by a nurturing of benevolent algorithms and digital hand-holding, the handicap of your dreams. It *is* of course possible to choose the easy settings and take the shortcut to wish-fulfilment, but if you are one of those people who can do that and still look at yourself in the clubhouse mirror afterwards, by all means go for it. Be aware though that it will be implicitly understood by the rest of the golfing fraternity that you number among those few laughable, Quixotic golfing mountebanks who routinely drop zeros from their scorecards and kick Titleists from the undergrowth with nary a pang of conscience. Enjoy your victory, Pyrrhic as it may be...<br><br>For the rest of us, keep the faith and understand the nature of the word 'addiction' in its truest sense, as your correspondent, at this very moment, prepares to slather deep heat on a pulled shoulder and cinch a lumbar support to its tightest setting in order to play another round. Pain is relative, while handicap is absolute. But one thing I know, when stepping up to the tee, full of codeine and misplaced optimism, this time, it's gonna be different...<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30369672', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30369672' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30369672\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30369672' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30369672\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30369672', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30369672_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30369672_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30438514\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198035364625\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"75098897\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1ec7070475e5fde31a85d1f7a97739b75314bf22.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1ec7070475e5fde31a85d1f7a97739b75314bf22.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1ec7070475e5fde31a85d1f7a97739b75314bf22_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198035364625\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75098897\">Casimir<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198035364625\/games\/?tab=all\">151 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198035364625\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198035364625\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">18.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI sat on this until Oculus support was released for it, and I can say now that it was well worth the wait.  Having already played many hours in the original game The Golf Club, I knew what to expect - for the most part - but the VR aspect was exciting, particularly as an avid RL golfer myself.<br><br>So far, the game hasn't disappointed at all.<br><br><b>TL&amp;DR<\/b> - For a quick rundown, the VR game places just like (well, for the most part) the original non-VR TGC.  In addition, the game links up with the main TGC game as well, so all of the courses available in the original TGC you can find, and play, in TGCVR.  The immersion is really good, the gameplay is very good, and it's just all around fun.  What's more, like others have said below, if you play golf IRL, those skills do transfer over - and not just the good skills, but also the bad (I still... STILL... hook the ball off the tee with the driver...).<br><br><b>In-Depth Review<\/b> - For those of you who enjoy golf and have a Vive or Oculus, you simply cannot beat this.  To be able to play a round whenever you like without having to leave the house is great (naturally, however, I'd still prefer to be out playing IRL when possible - but this is such a close second).<br><br>Graphics - the graphics for the Oculus are really good; I have mine cranked to maximum (2x normal) and it looks really smooth and plays great (I have a rig that can handle that however).<br><br>Gameplay - I could get very detailed here, but I'm going to focus instead on the VR mechanics specifically.  The interface is a lot different from the original TGC... there is no &quot;hud,&quot; etc.  Most of the menu items are there, you just have to navigate to them differently.  When selecting a course to play, it's not quite as easy to find courses as in the original TGC, mostly because the menu doesn't show a &quot;list&quot; like the original - instead it shows a picture of the course and it's name (which means there's fewer courses in view).  You can search for a course just like normal, but it's a bit clunky as you use an in-game keypad to type your search criteria.  What I've done is simply favorite all the course I play that I like - easy to find them again.<br><br>In regard to the standard &quot;hud&quot; information, like distance to the pin, the winds, elevation, etc., that can be found on your &quot;wristwatch.&quot;  You simply hold up your wrist a turn it like you're looking at a watch and the data shows up.  In addition, once you've struck a ball, you can hold up your wrist and click the button on the handle of the Touch to see the distance your shot went - it even grades you on your shot (the grade consists of several factors - impact, distance, and the lie once the ball stops).  It will also show you the speed of your swing, which is nice (apparently my swings hover between the 72-78 mph range).<br><br>If you hold down the handle button on the Touch while you swing, it will &quot;record&quot; your swing so you can turn and see a graphical indication of how the club head traveled on the takeaway all the way through to impact, and it will show you the angle and location of the club at impact as well.  This is really, really helpful, particularly to newer players.<br><br>Picking clubs is actually rather cool.  To pick up a club, you simply teleport to your bag (or walk, if you're play area is big enough), reach into your bag, hold the Touch over the club you want, and click the trigger.  Options exist to allow you to have to hold the trigger to keep the club in your hand, or just press the trigger once to grab it, and later a second time to drop it.  As an amusing afterthought, you can hit the club bag with what ever club you have in your hand to knock it over, spilling your clubs everywhere if you're on a slope.<br><br>Taking a shot is just like taking one IRL.  Address the ball, line up and aim, and swing.  The swing mechanics are very touchy, and if you don't swing correctly, you're ball will hook, slice, skip across the grass (if you top the ball), etc. - just like with real golf.<br><br>After a shot, you use one of the Touch's buttons (B) to teleport to your ball (your clubs automatically follow you).  You can alternatively use A to teleport where ever you want (literally - you can't teleport into water though).  A note on the greens - again, if you have a play area that is big enough, you can walk completely around your putting area and look closely at the path to the cup... it really helps when putting.<br><br>In addition, you can get a bird's eye view of the hole by reaching behind you in-game and grabbing the yardarge booklet, which will show you a top down view of the hole with yardage notations of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yards from the pin.  This is really handy, particularly with holes where the pin is obscured either by trees or a hill in the fairway - unlike TGC, there is no &quot;zoom&quot; feature that allows a flyover of the hole out to the distance of the selected club.<br><br>All these mechanics work very good with the Oculus Touch; as I said above, it's a great experience and a lot of fun to play.<br><br><b>Cons<\/b> - The only cons are what other's have said - just a couple of which I'll reiterate here, touching specifically upon Oculus and the Oculus Touch.<br><br>The first is the setup of your play area.  For me I had to set my default view 90 degrees to the left (my computer is on the right of my desk) because if I didn't the wire that connects the Oculus to the system got in the way every time I swung.  I don't know if this is the cause of my issues or not (in my case, it means one of my sensors is pointing at my right rear instead of in front of me).  But occasionally when I swing the club simply won't strike the ball - or, it'll strike it &quot;off&quot; - for example, occasionally my shots will shoot off about 20 degrees to the left, not with a hook, but straight and clean, as if I was aiming that direction.  To be clear, I don't know if this is a tracking issue or an issue with my setup - so keep that in mind.<br><br>However, as another user has said, when using the Protee Simulator to practice your swings, the tracking itself does seem off.  I couldn't even get the driver to make contact with the ball... all the other clubs worked okay though, but still suffered occasionally from the same issue I described above.<br><br>For Oculus users specifically, the Touch is a hit \/ miss when it comes to &quot;gripping the club.&quot;  I imagine that Vive users have it better because the Vive controller is longer and it looks like the player can grip it at least somewhat like a club with both hands.  With the Oculus Touch, however, the controller is so small there is no room to grip it with your off-hand.  As a result I end up gripping my right wrist with my left hand (I'm right handed) - which I'm sure contributes some to my off shots.  If there was a controller add-on that could add some length to the Touch for this it would help a lot.<br><br>Those things being said though, these are not game changers (unless you take your golf REALLY seriously), and annoyances at best in what is still an excellent, fun game.<br><br>Overall, again, for anyone interested in golf that has a Vive or Oculus, you cannot go wrong with The Golf Club VR.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30438514', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30438514' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30438514\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30438514' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30438514\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30438514', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30438514_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30438514_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30338125\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"26867535\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/\" data-miniprofile=\"26867535\">lizrdfishr<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/games\/?tab=all\">75 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197987133263\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you like golf, here is a VR game that doesn't ever end or get boring. This game lets me play amongst palm trees in March in my Colorado basement in slippers and shirt sleeves. I have no idea if this is going to help my real life golf game, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.<br><br>I found the mechanics of the game intuitive and simple to master. I love the swing evaluator, course selection, scenery, sounds and physics of the game. Chipping feels like chipping. The driver is hard to use because drivers are hard to use. I played 36 holes yesterday and am a little stiff this morning like I played 36 holes of golf yesterday. It just FEELS real.<br><br>User submitted courses make the course selection awesome and full of rich, diverse places to play, each with their own weather conditions and challenges. I played one round in winter and I was given yellow golf balls for the snow to add to the realism.<br><br>Multiplayer might make the game more fun for people who like to play in groups. A golf 'pro' to explain why my swing score was an 'F' on that last swing and of course a 'babe' in a beer cart might add value to the game.<br><br>On high resolutions I found it best to restart my PC between 18 hole games to prevent graphics glitches and to ensure smooth gameplay in later games. I also found it best to have a play space where the paddles cannot be masked from the sensors by your body and where you have enough room for a real life, full golf swing.<br><br>This gets two big thumbs up from me. I really only stopped playing long enough to type this. I'm going back to the Sunday Morning course (my favorite so far) and get in another round before breakfast.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30338125', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30338125' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30338125\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30338125' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30338125\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30338125', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30338125_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30338125_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30716132\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/epicconspiracy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"43157211\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e419ea79a056105f043274a541e8c6d15b99255.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e419ea79a056105f043274a541e8c6d15b99255.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e419ea79a056105f043274a541e8c6d15b99255_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/epicconspiracy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"43157211\">EpicConspiracy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/epicconspiracy\/games\/?tab=all\">381 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/epicconspiracy\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/epicconspiracy\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow this is a well made VR game.

In general, I'm blown away by how well it is done even in it's very early state.  As best I can tell, there's no detail that the dev team hasn't already thought about and most of these are already implemented into the game.  I think this is a game change and it fills a void for sim lovers who either don't have the space or the desire to do a full simulator setup.  Unfortunately this has likely ruined 2D golf for me.  I'm sure I'll still play 2D titles but this has far exceeded my expectations.<br><br>The game was just recently updated to include &quot;sticky clubs&quot; so that you no longer have to hold the trigger in order to hold the club in your hand.  So my thoughts below will be based on this new update since it has improved several things that were causing me some minor issues before.<br><br>Graphically - I guess it's better than expected given all the warnings I received about how VR graphics aren't great at the moment.  I think there's still some optimization to do but the fact that it's so immersive kinda overcomes any shortfalls on graphical fidelity.  This isn't an HBS issue though - it's more of the current state of this newer technology.<br><br>Immersion - this is where it's at with this game.  I can't say enough great things about it.  From the watch (which tells you the direction to the pin, wind direction, distance to the pin, stroke count, etc) to the course map in your back pocket to the golf bag it's just SO immersive.  A few cool things here:<br><br>1 - stepping over to your bag to grab your club is awesome.  There's just something cool about this that never gets old.<br>2 - when you find yourself at the bottom of a hill and you need to see what's up ahead so you can plan your shot, you just teleport ahead (or walk if it's a short enough distance) and take a look around.  Pick out a reference point in the distance as your aiming point, go back to your ball and take your shot.  Very realistic and very well implemented.<br>3 - hills, slopes, etc all work as expected.  If the ball is above my feet I have to adjust my swing both in terms of aim and in terms of club length.<br>4 - overall depth perception and changes in elevation are great.<br>5 - reaching into your bag for a ball when you need to take a drop.  Awesome.  They could've just made this a menu item but I'm glad they went the route that they did.<br>6 - gridless putting is WAY better than you'd think and better than anything in TGC or JNPG.  More on this later.<br><br>The swing.  The bad news on the swing is that it DOES require some adjustment from your normal real life golf swing.  I'm 98% certain that this is due to the total lack of weight (and proper distribution of weight in particular) when using the controller as your &quot;club.&quot;  If you've played a lot of golf in real life then it will be an adjustment.  For some it seems to be a pretty wild adjustment and for others not so much.  If you don't play much real life golf then it probably won't matter.  I will say that with the latest update where you are no longer required to hold the trigger to hold your club, it makes for a MUCH more natural swing and has alleviated most of my issues with the swing interface.  Prior to this update I had to address the ball with a massively closed club face in order to ensure that my club face was square on impact.  Now I do not have to do this.  I also had to address the ball with the ball lined up on the toe of the club in order to hit it in the center of the club on my downswing.  This is no longer required.  I think now that I can hold the controller with a normal golf grip things are falling more into line with my normal swing.<br><br>The act of swinging the club in this game is fantastic!!  Just like in real life I know when I hit a bad shot without even looking at the result.  And just like in real life I have to concentrate to execute a good shot.  I've also learned that, just like in real life, if I take a practice swing (even a shortened version to ensure that my takeaway motion and follow through motions are clean) that I have much better success.  In other words - this is NOT some hokey arcade VR swing.  It's a true swing and it tracks VERY accurately.<br><br>There is no shot shaper.  You ARE the shot shaper and it works wonderfully.  I can hit any sort of shot that I can hit in real life.  <br><br>Short game - awesome.  Can't say enough good things here.  From off the green I can use my 7 iron to hit a bump and run or I can use my lob wedge or sand wedge to chip the ball.  On Casual mode (next to easiest difficulty) there is a power boost that's built into the game (this reduces in amateur mode and it goes away all together on Pro mode) and it will be obvious if you try to bump and run with a 7 iron.  But the mechanics are there and it's done VERY well.  The only issue currently is that there is too much spin on the lob wedge.  They know this and are fixing it.  But I can either close the face down a bit and hit a sharp little pitch at the pin or I can open up the face a bit and hit a loftier shot that carries further but bites harder.<br><br>Putting - awesome.  I think they have NAILED putting.  It can feel odd to putt with little to no weight and this can also cause your club head to move around a bit more (harder to control a straight motion) but once you get used to it, it's awesome.  But where putting REALLY shines is when you turn the grids off.  Holy moly!  The greens are every bit as readable as they are in real life.  I simply teleport to about 3-4 feet behind my ball, crouch down and start reading the greens.  Then, while still squatting down, I teleport up a little to read other areas as needed.  I plan my putt, teleport back to the ball and execute.  And, for me... it's spot on, dead accurate.  Playing without grids in TGC VR is the most immersive thing I've ever experience in a video game.  Drain a 20 footer for par (or better) and you'll be fist pumping like a mofo.<br><br>Things that aren't so great.<br><br>1 - Fairway bunkers.  EVERY single time you land in a fairway bunker you are penalized by roughly 50%.  So the best you can do is blast out into the fairway and drop a shot.  The devs are aware and are addressing this.<br>2 - Graphics but this isn't an HBS issue as much as it is a limitation of the hardware.  Although I think there is still some optimization left to be done and I know they are looking into this constantly.<br>3 - The setup.  VR with today's technology simply requires you to jump through a few hoops.  You've got to get your base stations mounted, you've got this huge contraption on your head with a long bundle of chords leading to your PC, etc.  It takes me about 5 minutes to setup and about 5 minutes to clean up afterwards.  With 2D golf, I just grab my controller and take off - no real setup time at all.<br><br>Things that have blown me away:<br>1 - The dev interaction on the steam forums.  Superb and professional<br>2 - The immersion of the game and the attention to details by the dev team in producing this product<br>3 - Putting and short game accuracy<br>4 - Game interface.  It could've been clunky and awkward.  Nope.  Everything flows and before you hit your 3rd hole of your first ever round you'll be comfortably navigating around without giving it a second thought.<br>5 - The difficulty and the clear fact that this is a sim and not an arcade game.  I haven't broken 90 yet and I'm still on casual level.  I'm a 13 handicap IRL.  Some may say that the game is harder than real life and in some aspects it's true but the more I play the better I'm getting and I expect to see more parity between my real life golf scores and TGC VR scores over time.<br><br>In general - I couldn't be more pleased.  This is probably the single best video game experience I've ever had and it's just the beginning.

The ambience, graphics, ball physics, etc,... are really good, but I have a complaint about the performance of the game. I have a Pc with an i7 6700, GTX 1080 and 16Gb Ram and I can not set the visual graphics in high. If I put the visual graphics in medium sometimes the game starts to judder then I have to change the visual settings to Low. Please devs improve the performance of the game. Another thing is that the player has not any visual help, if you try to find where the green is, the player needs to check the map or teleport around the field, for skilled players this is very good, but for noob players like me, this makes the game be a bit too hard. The same with the clubs, I don't know the average yardage with any of them, then as a sugestion for CASUAL mode, help the noob players with more info please.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26114648', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26114648' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26114648\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26114648' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26114648\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26114648', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26114648_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26114648_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26176305\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"64778866\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/6511e68e9f2a4b246c4d0a999bde49f4525abfb5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/6511e68e9f2a4b246c4d0a999bde49f4525abfb5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/6511e68e9f2a4b246c4d0a999bde49f4525abfb5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/\" data-miniprofile=\"64778866\">Freedious<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/games\/?tab=all\">48 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025044594\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Golf Club VR was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a must buy for anyone who plays golf. Had many holy **** moments, feeling like I was on a course. Even bent my knees in anguish on a few missed putts. Super imersive and the locomotion system is crisp and very functional. I love racing my shot to the green, then watching it drop from the sky with some backspin. Nice.<br><br>The amount of time the ball is in the air makes it feel like you crushed the shot, and often you do. Controling your aim and your distance are very challenging but that's good. You want there to be room for improvement and tweaks to your technique. I tried one-handed and two-handed grips. Each seems to have their place. One-handed on full shots, two handed on chips and putts. Would love to see how people grip their controller and would love to see a some small club accessories that hold the Vive controller. <br><br>For the devs: Great work, thank you. Here are a few of my wishes:<br><br>-Driving range, chipping green and putting green so you can learn your distances and practice different swing styles.<br>-A line on the putter head. Would help with alignment.<br>-A camera option that teleports you to the spot where your ball will end up. Watching a shot land never gets old.<br>-Save game feature. Don't always have time for 18.<br>-Online, computer opponent, etc.  Not the highest priority but expected eventually. <br>-Option to not have to hold the trigger while you swing. It got tiresome and limited the ways I could grip the controller.<br>-Show shot distance after each shot, maybe on yardage book, so you can learn your distances better.  <br><br>Looking forward to the updates. Keep up the great work!  <br><br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26176305', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26176305' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26176305\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26176305' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26176305\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26176305', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26176305_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26176305_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30174254\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"2200800\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1a9ab419410f2e2793ac7bdec7c47713d291f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1a9ab419410f2e2793ac7bdec7c47713d291f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1a9ab419410f2e2793ac7bdec7c47713d291f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/\" data-miniprofile=\"2200800\">paulohotline\u00ae<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/games\/?tab=all\">1,008 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/recommended\/\">51 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Paulohotline\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">33.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGOLFVR just left beta and I have to say its pretty amazing. I played live with a friend from Ottawa yesterday 18 holes for 2 hours, Shot a 105! it felt like I was playing on a real course, all I needed was a beer in my hand to sip every 5 shots. GOLFVR has over 130,000 courses and a few from Manitoba too. For $32CAN buckaroos, its an amazing achievement. I am going to open up my VR studio next week to anyone here in Winnipeg who wants to come by and check it out for free. Golfing has never been so much fun! 10\/10 Golf Balls.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30174254', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30174254' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30174254\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30174254' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30174254\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30174254', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30174254_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30174254_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30273552\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hiandthemoon\/recommended\/489600\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"165990992\">hiandthemoon<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used The Golf Club VR on January 16, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLove this game!
