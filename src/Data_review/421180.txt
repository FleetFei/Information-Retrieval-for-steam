Visual style similarity borrowed from <i>Limbo<\/i> works splendidly and the game has still a nice amount of its own surprises to show.<\/b><br><br>Reading some other reviews out here, I admit <i>Umbra<\/i> does strike some similarities to <i>Limbo<\/i> especially in the first couple of levels and in the visual style. The similarities end there, as <i>Umbra<\/i> does its own thing while keeping being a physics puzzle platformer.<br><br>Story is pretty simple. Sisters get abducted by aliens. Fortunately for you, the big sis, the robot who took you breaks down and you escape to save your little sister.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Borrow a little something<\/div><br>While doing it extremely well, <i>Limbo<\/i> was hardly the first platformer using unfair traps: they were there in e.g. Dragon's Lair (NES version) and <i>I Wanna Be The Guy<\/i> (which took it to the extreme).<br><br>Umbra also has many mean surprise traps. In fact, you are likely to die to 95% of the traps when encountering them for the first time. Especially first and second levels are basically tributes to <i>Limbo<\/i> in this sense.<br><br>After that the differences grow larger. For one, big sister can swim and dive, permitting a couple interesting but oh, so slow-paced water puzzles. The character is slow at swimming and water takes aeons to drain or refill. Later on one gets to drive a truck through a couple of puzzle and death-filled levels and finally even carry and shoot a frickin' plasma LMG.<br><br>Puzzles are not as awesomely well made as in <i>Limbo<\/i> (duh) but they get the job done. In-game hint system keeps you from being stuck while actually being a hint instead of just telling the answer. Granted, most puzzles in <i>Umbra<\/i> aren't that difficult to require more than a simple pointing finger as a hint.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Danger and death everywhere<\/div><br>Unfortunately while cool, the truck levels were also the most frustrating in the game. This is because that later the game gets stingy with check points. There's a couple of 5-10 minute sequences where one can screw up in the end and have to restart in the beginning.<br><br>Deaths are not only due to traps. Fall damage is everywhere, as the protagonist can take only a couple of meters fall before dying or hitting her head. A little miss step and you're dead. There's even a sneaky surprise trap that uses this and consequently makes you drop carefully down every edge afterwards.<br><br>I also died many times because of faulty, buggy physics: by falling into the small crack in-between two crates and somehow being crushed; by impaling into the spikes that were on the underside of the moving platform I just climbed on; by peculiarly not grabbing the ledge I thought I landed on and instead falling to my death. Only after the first playthrough did I learn to avoid these fallouts.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">How do you even drive this thing?<\/div><br>I played <i>Umbra<\/i> with Xbox 360 controller although keyboard would likely have been just as well. All keys and buttons can be remapped.<br><br>Controls are pretty good and smooth as long as you stay on foot. The big sister runs, jumps, hangs, swings and climbs like a pro. There's a bug (or a feature?) on jumps that whenever one jumps straight up, the character faces right even if you started facing left. It can be annoying if you really want to grab that ledge left, directly over you.<br><br>Swimming is slow as heck, realistic though it is. Big sis can even dive and hold her breath for half a minute. On the edge of water it's a weird as the game differentiates between diving and swimming. I once randomly encountered a bug where I was diving in the air but couldn't move or drown either.<br><br>Later levels stage the truck. Since the controls are entirely on or off, you can only full throttle or not at all. This is unfortunate, as you need to drive slowly to avoid crashing the car, so you have to smash the drive key to reach a reasonable speed but not over-do it. Weirdly, if you drive backwards, you can't brake or speed up forward meaning it's impossible to stop on a lean platform. You guessed it: this leads to certain death.<br><br>Finally, as this is not a twin-stick shooter, the gun is rather clumsy to aim, controlling the slope with right stick while shooting with the action key. When you get a gun, obviously you will be shot back. It's cumbersome to dodge the flashy blaster shots, as while carrying the gun you have to be stationary to crouch.<br><br>Also, there's no key to drop the gun that I could find, instead the gun just falls if you manage a slightly higher fall than a simple jump.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Technical side and style<\/div><br>If you read the above section, you can already tell that there are quite a many bugs and issues. I can only hope they will get fixed or alleviated somehow. That said, I really enjoyed my time with <i>Umbra<\/i>. Perhaps surprisingly I encountered no game-breaking bugs, and if one gets stuck (which unfortunately happened a dozen times) one could always restart from the previous respawn point.<br><br>Visually the graphical style fits <i>Umbra<\/i> marvellously. It's a bit more colourful than <i>Limbo<\/i> with some roughly but nicely coloured backgrounds every now and then, with red-yellow fire and the usual blue electricity.<br><br>Even the <i>Limbo<\/i> guy makes an appearance as a rather obvious easter egg: there are side quest prisoners to save that strike a not-so subtle resemblance. No one explains how they got there though. Did the aliens get them too?<br><br>By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack. It keeps the tone mysterious and dark but in an delightful way.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusions<\/div><br>My very first playthrough was over 5 hours long, and then I did two playthroughs of about 2 hours to finish the rest of the achievements. There seems to be only one ending - I was hoping for a different one if I did a near-perfect run.<br><br><i>Umbra<\/i> is after all a good game. It <i>is<\/i> rough around the edges and needs patience to finish. Plethora of bugs and lack of checkpoints in a few frustrating puzzles keeps it from being a great game. However, for a project done by a single person I can cut some slack. All in all I think it was well worth the price of 4 euros.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25152896', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25152896' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25152896\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25152896' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25152896\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25152896', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25152896_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25152896_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19820565\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010649381\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"50383653\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6ccb596d92afcc7deef74a187582a6e18b2f12bd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6ccb596d92afcc7deef74a187582a6e18b2f12bd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6ccb596d92afcc7deef74a187582a6e18b2f12bd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010649381\/\" data-miniprofile=\"50383653\">Amicable Invader<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010649381\/games\/?tab=all\">130 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010649381\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010649381\/recommended\/421180\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 21, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have never played Limbo like the previous reviewer so I have nothing to compare this game to.  Its a dark puzzle game which has seen me gassed, spiked, sliced open with a swinging axe thing, burnt to dead and fallen into the dark abyss below.  I'l be honest i was surprised by how much I liked this game.<br><br>First thing that caught my eye was it was so cheap.  The controls felt basic at the start but it didnt take me long to get used to them.  Also For anyone who thinks the game is too hard the game creators in their mercy have put in a hint key. Anytime your stuck hit the H key and you get a hint at the area your stuck at.  Tempting to use all the time but it still doesn't ruin the puzzle when you do use it.  <br><br>Also a great bonus is the respawning so close to where you die.  The checkpoints must be every 5 or 10 steps as I never seem to respawn too far away from where i died.  In a puzzle game like this where you die alot this comes in handy. <br><br>The grusome ragdoll deaths keep in with the tone of the game if that makes sence and even the way the characters ponytail bobs when running are wee signs the creators were thinking when putting this together.<br><br>I'm gonna keep playing this as it has my attention.<br><br>Heres a first level play through if you are still making up your mind. <br><br>P.S Any laggyness is the fault of my computer running recording software at the same time.  The game itself is usually smooth when the recording software is off.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T7RNzLhLg9Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T7RNzLhLg9Y<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19820565', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19820565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19820565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19820565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19820565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19820565', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19820565_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19820565_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20554012\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198109496854\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"149231126\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/7301a558870f6ce5bb2ecb7ef55f026c7428d843.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/7301a558870f6ce5bb2ecb7ef55f026c7428d843.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/7301a558870f6ce5bb2ecb7ef55f026c7428d843_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198109496854\/\" data-miniprofile=\"149231126\">ThrashExpress<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198109496854\/games\/?tab=all\">827 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198109496854\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198109496854\/recommended\/421180\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUmbra is a fun cinematic puzzle platformer in the vein of Limbo. You play a girl who's sister is abducted by alien robots, and it's your job to get her back. Along the way, you free other trapped children you come across, drive a monster truck, and even wield a powerful machine gun.<br><br>Overall, I found the levels and puzzles to be reasonably inventive and fun to complete. There is one particular puzzle that requires too much repetition, which momentarily slows the pace of the game. But once you get past it, the game moves along again at a brisk pace. Also, the last couple of levels are fairly large and could definitely use some additional checkpoints. <br><br>Given the length and quality of Umbra, I'd say the game is priced very fairly at $4. It takes 4 to 5 hours to complete. I never got stuck in the game, but there's a helpful hint system should you need it. But seriously, if you finished Limbo, nothing in Umbra should hold you up for very long.<br><br>I definitely recommend Umbra. I played through the game twice, the second time picking up some extra achievements. It's not as polished or original as Limbo, but it's a fun game for those who enjoy the genre.<br><br>Note: Don't let the minimum requirements of an I5 processor deter you. This game plays smoothly on my mid-level Core-2-Duo with a humble Radeon HD 4670 graphics card. Try the demo if you're not sure your system can handle it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20554012', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20554012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20554012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20554012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20554012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20554012', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20554012_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20554012_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/421180\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25152896","19820565","20554012"]}
