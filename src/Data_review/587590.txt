It did have bad things about it, but also good things about it. The game itself wasn't that clear in what was happening, or where you needed to go. It was a very unique game, and had an interesting story mechanic.<br><br>So, I am going to start off with a bad point in the game, but the game itself wasn't bad. The game was not clear in where you needed to go, and what you needed to do, outside of providing onscreen cues. Often when playing this game I had to take a few tries to figure out what it was expecting me to do, and sometimes these actions were a bit unstable, for example the swing. And it was not always clear that you had to do something, like jump on rocks, because they had no distinct outline. The goal was quite, as you could say, unexpected. One more thing about the game that wasn't fantastic was that you cannot save, or take screenshots. But the game is short enough that saving is relevant.<br><br>This was a very unique game. I really enjoy games that don't conform to the norm of video games. This game was unqiue in many aspects, it had minimal controls, which didn't at all feel trapping. It had a very surreal setting, which is always refreashing for video games. The game itself felt like I was watching a movie, not because it didn't let me play, but it was quite theatrical in its scene transitions, often fading out and fading in, as well as automatically controlling certain actions sometimes. This game achieved a feeling of being dreamlike very well in its uniqueness.<br><br>The game used no words as such, instead it told the story through visuals (and if there was voice acting, I could not hear it), the story of what is actually happening can be read in the game's blurb on its Steam Store Page, but it is much nicer to figure it out yourself. The game's blocky graphics did not do anything to hinder this visual storytelling, no object was too blocky to see what object it was. The game itself is quite short, but enjoyable. If however you measure the value of the game by time taken to play, and not enjoyablility, you may think this game too short. The story itself is quite good, very abstract.<br><br>Overall this game is a nice little quirky gem for anyone who wants to quickly experience a unique game and enjoy some unconventional storyline.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29795734', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29795734' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29795734\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29795734' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29795734\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29795734', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29795734_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29795734_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_container multiple_listing store\" id=\"ReviewDevResponsesummary29795734\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_exists_date\">A developer has responded on Feb 9 @ 6:41am<br><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198068465411\/recommended\/587590\/#developer_response\">(view response)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: both;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/587590\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29795734"]}
