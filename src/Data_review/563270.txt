While the game is a bit rough around the edges in some aspects, the art and OST are great and it still does a serviceable job as a RPG that will hold your attention for the duration of the journey.<\/div><br>Edit: This game was made with Smile Game Builder, NOT RPGMaker.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvMzCpCmrZ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvMzCpCmrZ4<\/a><br><br>In Vitra is the developer's first foray into the RPG world and, while it may not knock any socks off, it's still a solid title. You play as Noa, a young man who lives in the port town, Porta Nova, and are quickly joined by a trio of other young'uns within the first few hours. <br><br>Fun fact: Noa and his friend, Luke, are based off of the developer's son and his son's friend respectively. The developer's son also helped program a couple of the game's puzzles, which are simple push-the-box-out-of-the-way puzzles. <br><br>You can play with keyboard and mouse or with controller, which is a nice surprise. Both work well, so it's really up to your preference. I personally like playing with a controller, which consists of using the left stick to move, right stick to adjust the camera, holding X while moving to run, B for the menu, and A to navigate menus and dialogue. Nothing unusual there. Y, however, can be used to change your point of view from third person to first person (but only in specific locations)--which is a pretty cool feature and immerses you in the gameplay a bit more; at least while exploring as this does nothing to change combat. <br><br>Right off the bat, the game's lack of a journal or any way to keep track of quests is made evident as you are given a series of fetch quests to get you acclimated to the game mechanics. While you could argue that this is an old school decision, the inability to check your progress for quests or even what quests you've picked up unless you go back to the quest giver swiftly becomes tedious--especially if you stop playing the game for a period of time. This is my biggest gripe with the game and hopefully one that can and will be amended.<br><br>The majority of the game is presented in 3D models and you are able to enter buildings, interact with specific objects, and talk to NPCs.\u00a0 Another minor issue I had was the appearance of the NPCs themselves: while the art style is nice, 3\/4th of the male NPCs look *exactly* the same without even a re-colouring as I've seen some games resort to. As a result, the game world felt a bit hollow and the immersion was lessened. Battle is presented as 1D images that are much more detailed and colourful than the on-screen sprites. <br><br>Battles are turn-based affairs during which the fastest person attacks first and will happen at random while you explore outside of towns. If you've ever played an RPG, you'll be right at home here. You can use skills, items, defend, or run away during your turn. The enemies are much more varied than the NPCs and fit well with the fantasy theme.\u00a0 The attack animations are nice to look at; the characters change expressions much like characters in a visual novel and the slashes and spells are projected onto the enemy. Your foes don't have HP bars, which means you'll have no idea how close to death one is unless you've faced the creature before and have a general idea of how tough it is. This feature (or lack thereof) means you'll need to be cautious when engaging in combat with stronger foes.<br><br>Battles in In Vitra are pretty challenging as a whole and being properly outfitted will make all the difference between life and death. A challenge is fine, but the game doesn't do a very good job of scaling enemy level and that adds a measure of unnecessary difficulty because you can easily walk into the next area that you're supposed to visit in your linear journey only to be flattened by monsters that you should have been able to handle. I found that I had to go back to the previous area and grind up a level and\/or gather up some cash to buy new gear in order to progress on more than one occasion. Quests have the same issue: you pick them up from random NPCs along the way and, since you'll likely lose track of it if you leave the area, you'll try to do them as soon as possible... only to find that the monster you're asked to kill can one-shot you. <br><br>Your characters gain experience, money (DUC), and items after you've defeated enemies and as they level up, they'll automatically learn new abilities. You have no control over what stat points go where, but you do have the ability to outfit your characters with equipment. Each hero and heroine fits into the standard RPG job classes--attacker, support, mage, tank-- that will limit what they can and can't utilize.<br><br><br><b>**Edit: This no longer seems to be an issue. <\/b> I did find some small technical issues: my character jumped backwards when passing from one area to another. <br><br>There's a brief loading message between areas which aren't marked so you get a seemingly random &quot;now loading&quot; message. Otherwise, the game runs as it should; no crashes or freezing.<br><br>.Pros. <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>The art style is nice to look at.<br><\/li><li> The soundtrack is great.<br><\/li><li> The game is challenging. You'll be required to think strategically and use your abilities to your advantage or enemies will crush you.<br><\/li><li> Enemies are varied enough in appearance and behaviour to keep battle fresh.<br><\/li><li> The ability to change POV is pretty cool, though ultimately has no game-changing application. It gives the game an old-school dungeon crawler feel.<\/li><\/ul><br>.Cons.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> A little too old school for my tastes in some aspects. There's no HP bar for enemies and no way of keeping track of quests, for instance. <br><\/li><li> Minor technical issues, as listed above.<br><\/li><li> The translation is a little awkward in some places.<br><\/li><li> Can get a little grindy. New allies are several levels below your older party members, which doesn't help.<br><\/li><li> Half of the NPCs look like the same person. This won't bother everyone, but I definitely noticed it. <\/li><\/ul><br>.Bottom Line.<br>These issues aside, In Vitra offers you a pretty standard RPG experience. <br><br>The 7.99 USD price tag is fair* and, as long as you don't mind the lack of a quest counter and the subsequent wandering around it causes and you're not easily deterred by a game over that probably would not have happened had the game been more balanced, you'll enjoy the game for what it is: a solid JRPG.<br><br>There's a demo available and it'll give you a good idea of what to expect, so give it a shot if you're still on the fence after reading this.<br><br>*I'm about 3 hours in at the time of writing this and I've only just seen the second major town where there are hints of the plot twist the Store Page hints at. I'll update my review if anything surprising comes up.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_code\">If this review helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.
