FFV did not exist. I discovered emulation, and FFV suddenly existed. Needless to say it was one of the most exciting experiences to play a 'new' FF game that previously did not exist. There's a website called The Spirit of Final Fantasy V, and honestly, it's like the strategy guide we never had. Overall, THAT experience was amazing.<br><br>So SE had the FF series half off, and I decided to buy FFV to revisit it again with the all new and improved graphics. I have to say, I like it a lot. I cannot remember if the script is different, but it seems different. But overall, I never felt FFV was very strong script-wise. I think the main appeal is the gameplay and that's all in tact and still fun to this day.<br><br>I highly recommend the portrait mod that makes the hair colors and costume colors of the portrats match the sprites. (Why they didn't do this in the first place is beyond me.) I also recommend buying a controller though it caused problems for me. EDIT: Originally, I was using Joy2Key, but using my PS4 controller with an xwrapper works flawlessly.<br><br>Overall, I really liked it, and I feel it's an improvement on the original.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30344366', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30344366' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30344366\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30344366' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30344366\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30344366', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30344366_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30344366_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t234 of 348 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18195362\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"32398801\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/7241d6ce08a9652abe3255a97259b08ae3af2c55.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/7241d6ce08a9652abe3255a97259b08ae3af2c55.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/7241d6ce08a9652abe3255a97259b08ae3af2c55_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/\" data-miniprofile=\"32398801\">Sly<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/games\/?tab=all\">155 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Scauthra\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">39.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt really bugs me that so many of the reviews that tell you to not play this game have placed less than an hour into it. I was a big critic of the art style when I saw FFV hit the Steam Store, but since it's my second favorite in the series I wanted a go at it again. I've played the GBA version and an emulated version. Now for some points.<br><br>I can say with certainty if you liked FFV, you'll enjoy this adaptation. The artwork is not so bad after all. I have quite enjoyed the animations used. Watching Faris as a Monk using a spell. it just works. It does not feel odd or out of place. It does not feel rushed. Story animations are as funny or sorrowful as they were in the SNES version. The music is not remastered, but that does not take away any points. It's exactly the soundtrack you fell in love with before. And if you're new to FFV, you wont be dissapointed. People in the reviews encourage you to go emulate the game because it's better. At this point, it does not matter what version of the game you play, it's still FFV at it's core.<br><br>If you never played FFV, let me just say the job system will sell you on this game. It's fun, addicting and it will push you to mix things up. You unlock a lot of jobs really fast, so you're not stuck being just a simple mage, or just a fighter. Most fights can't just be spammed auto attacks and win, you have to go into them with some thought.<br><br>By the end of the day, if you like RPGs, depths, or Final Fantasy games. Get it. Enjoy it, and don't worry about the sub 1 hour reviews throwing a hissy fit.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18195362', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18195362' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18195362\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18195362' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18195362\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18195362', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18195362_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18195362_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20434822\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"109005975\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/\" data-miniprofile=\"109005975\">Nerd House<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/games\/?tab=all\">2,965 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/\">172 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Fantasy V<\/div><b>Developer<\/b>: Square-Enix<br><b>Publisher<\/b>: Square-Enix<br><br><b>Introduction<\/b><br>==========<br>Final Fantasy V is the fifth and in my opinion a very underrated entry in the esteemed Final Fantasy franchise. It took the Job System introduced in Final Fantasy III and refined it, delivering a highly customizable and adaptive experience for the player. It also features a small handful of memorable characters, and doesn't fall prey to &quot;the REAL villian comes out of nowhere at the end&quot; trope that a handful of RPGs typically use.<br><br>The Steam version is based on the iOS port, and as such comes with the bugs, flaws, and complaints that version had. The most notable of which are the character portraits and character sprites. Put those minor complaints aside, and you have yourself a great RPG. Please do not let the graphics put you off of this grand adventure!<br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>==========<br>As said above, Final Fantasy V takes the Job System of Final Fantasy III and improved it. Instead of the formulaic, behind-the-scenes way FF3 handled how Jobs leveled up, FFV favors a simpler approach. After every battle you earn Experience Points, Gil, and Job Points. Every Job levels up a few times, and each level requires more and more Job Points. The first level can be anywhere between 10 and 30 Job Points, depending on the Job, and as they level higher, you may see numbers like 150, 200, or even 999 for a select few Jobs! As you gain levels in each Job, you learn an ability from that Job that you can then assign to your characters <i>even when they are not using that job.<\/i> This opens up a plethora of customization opportunites and different playstyles.<br><br>As for the game itself, the game utilizes the tried and true turn-based ATB system. When the ATB gauge fills up you are able to give commands to your party, then wait for the gauge to fill up again to take another action. Basic stuff, but it works very well. There are a lot of abilities and spells to learn, including White Magic, Black Magic, Blue Magic, Songs, Summons, and Time Magic. All of these can be mixed and matched in the Job System to create some truly flexible battle setups. While the game doesn't really present any truly challenging battles (apart from the super bosses), much of the game can be completed with a simple setup like 2 Knights, a White Mage, and a Black Mage.<br><br><b>Graphics<\/b><br>==========<br>This version comes with updated sprites and character portraits. This is a point of contention with some of the playerbase, as many do not like the &quot;new look&quot;. For those where this is a major concern, a mod was created that you can find online that replaced the character portraits with art that matches the sprites. Barring that complaint, the rest of the game looks okay. In some areas you can clearly see the borders of each tile, and in some places it sticks out like a sore thumb. This was another complaint. While not major, it's VERY noticeable, and depending on how you are or how you like your games to look, this may or may not be a problem. Check out the game's screenshots before making a buying decision.<br><br><b>Sound and Music<\/b><br>==========<br>Another game soundtrack composed by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu! Final Fantasy V has some iconic themes of it's own, such as Battle on the Big Bridge. Each track contributes to the situation at hand and enhances the player's attachment to the characters and story. This is music done right. Here's Battle on the Big Bridge:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l0JnXdfoYpY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l0JnXdfoYpY<\/a><br><br>Sound effects are pretty basic, but do their job. Nothing really groundbreaking, but the soundtrack more than makes up for the shortcomings in the sound effects department.<br><br><b>Performance<\/b><br>==========<br>PC specs are on my profile. The game ran very well, no major problems occured. It's an older RPG, so FPS isn't really a concern in this case. I used a Logitech F310 controller for the entirety of my playthough, and it worked just fine by default. Didn't have to change anything for it to work properly.<br><br><b>Final Thoughts<\/b><br>==========<br>If you never got the chance to play Final Fantasy V back in the day, this would be a great opportunity to do so. Great characters, great story, and a superb character customization system makes Final Fantasy V a fantastic entry in the series...although it is frequently overlooked. Don't make that mistake, give it a shot!<br><br><b>Gameplay Demo<\/b><br>==========<br>This video is intended to show off the job system and how customizable it is.

It has all the content and the hilarious translation of the GBA version, the sprites are actually, in my opinion, MUCH better and more expressive then the GBA version (Galuf's beard is the right color instead of an out of place orange, for example), the iconic job system is as amazing as ever, the music is as good as ever, and the game itself runs smooth as butter.<br><br>And, of course, all the pluses of FF5 in general are here.  The good plot, the hilarious, well developed characters, the challenging, satisfying boss fights, and the satisfaction you get when you finally beat a boss that took you forever or found a secret you never did before.<br><br>Don't let the haters deter you.

I'm seeing in the reviews that lots of people are having issues without slowdowns and bugs, but I didn't experience any in the almsot 40 hours I logged onto it. The game ran very well and overall was a very enjoyable game. My FPS never dipped down and the game ran smoothly the entire time.  While it wasn't my first time playing FF5, it's without a doubt one of the more underrated FF games out there. The battle system is enjoyable and overall I liked how the game looked compared to the other verisons I have played with it. I wouldn't take those negative reviews you see on the front page too seriously, it's a great game and for the price without a doubt worth picking up.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18265661', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18265661' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18265661\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18265661' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18265661\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18265661', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18265661_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18265661_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18579751\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skripion\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"71331859\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bc\/bcd0e3c7c3b4a2036ed92203c0b8d6c11e5a40f7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bc\/bcd0e3c7c3b4a2036ed92203c0b8d6c11e5a40f7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bc\/bcd0e3c7c3b4a2036ed92203c0b8d6c11e5a40f7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skripion\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71331859\">Skripion<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skripion\/games\/?tab=all\">509 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skripion\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skripion\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">48.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have played all main Final Fantasy games and for some reason Final Fantasy V is my favourite. Before playing steam version, I have played the game on psone.<br><br>The story is very simple. First you need to save four crystals. After that you need to save the world by stopping main antagonist, who is simply just evil. Story is sometimes very serious, but it has a lot of funny moments so it's never too serious.<br><br>Job system is awesome. You can choose one job class at a time for each of the four characters. Then you can train the job until you get skill that you like or until you master the job. I only wish that you could choose more skills on default class. You can choose two skills on default class or thee on one other class. Still mastering different jobs do pay off by giving better stats. It's just fun to master many different classes.<br><br>I've noticed that some people have complained that game doesn't run smoothly. For me the counter said 60 fps all the time and I didn't notice any problems. Some people have complained that music is just the original music. I didn't mind that since I loved the music and it didn't need any fixing in my opinion. New sprites do look nice. I'm just happy that they didn't change animation much, since I loved the old animations. Only real issue for me in this game was when someone talked, there was a portray of the person talking. Most of these portrays didn't look anything like the character in the game. <br><br>This game had new classes and new dungeon compared to the psone version. New classes were nice and the dungeon seems cool. Unfortunately I haven't gone far in the dungeon yet, since you can enter there only after finishing the game. <br><br>Still if you own any other version of the game and you are not hardcore fan of Final Fantasy V, I'm not sure if you should buy this version unless it's on sale. Steam version has only few new things added compared to psone version and I believe that compared to GBA or iOS version, this has even less new features.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18579751', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18579751' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18579751\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18579751' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18579751\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18579751', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18579751_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18579751_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21342918\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">pepsimanvsjoe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,486 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/\">244 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo me, V is one of the gold standards of the Final Fantasy franchise. Now before I go any further, I should establish that I have enjoyed almost every main-line FF game. The sole exceptions are II, XI, and XIV, and that's mainly because I don't play MMOs. FFV is something special because everything clicks. This is one of those rare games where every aspect is perfect. &quot;Every aspect is perfect&quot;. Wait... what? Why not just say &quot;FFV is a perfect game&quot;? Uhhh...huh. To this I say that if FFV is a perfect game, then what would be the point of playing other games unless they too were perfect? Would I be able to devote an equal amount of time to all these perfect games? Would one game be more perfect than the other? Besides, today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. We should all strive to-ENOUGH!<br><br>How about we focus on actually discussing FFV? God frikkin' dammit!<br><br>This entry in the series is notable for its Job system. Early on, the four warriors of light are introduced to the crystal shards. These allow the heroes to change their job(class) at any moment outside of combat. While FFIII did it first, FFV expands upon the system, by allowing players to mix and match abilities. So your White Mage, who usually twiddles their thumbs during a random encounter, can use their bare hands almost as well as any Monk. The trade-off is that White Mages don't get the Monk's large HP pool. In any case, this system allows players innumerable options for dealing with monsters. Grinding, as always, is a last resort. If your party is failing to beat a boss, maybe their jobs need to be changed, or their abilities aren't adaptable. <br><br>While I applaud Square-Enix for adding additional content to FFV: Advance (which this port is loosely based-on), I'm not too fond of the end\/post-game. As any FFV fan will tell you, a party of Freelancers with every job mastered is absurdly over-powered. The original version of FFV takes note of this, hence the super-bosses Omega Weapon and Shinryu. FFV:A goes a few steps further with an additional dungeon, enhanced versions of those bosses, and a Super de-duper ultimate final boss to boot. Oh and everything loves to counter your !rapidfire attacks. After a certain point, it all becomes just a little absurd. <br><br>So let's take a step back and look at the main game, the &quot;story mode&quot; if you will. The real brilliance of the job system is not in combining all of the abilities to make super-boss smashing Gods, but in making for hundreds of ways to play through the game. The challenge-run is a long-standing Final Fantasy tradition. Ever played a party of all White Mages in FFI? A no-esper run in FFVI? FFV is hardly any different. This is an RPG that can be beaten with literally any combination of jobs. Yes, even a single berserker can defeat the final boss. They have to be level 99, have specialized equipment, and it's still a 1 in 249484140 chance, but it can be done. The point is, there is no wrong way to play through FFV. Your heroes can be whatever you want, and by using all of the tools available to you, you can see the game to the end. <br><br>FFV also wisely chooses to avoid large cinematic set-pieces or overly-extensive conversations. This is a game made up almost entirely of overworld and dungeons. Later FF games have a lot of memorable sequences, but for me they don't hold up when being replayed. Take FFVI for example. I'm one of those rare players that prefers the second half of the game. I like the freedom that comes with exploring a world, choosing party-members, and building their abilities. The focus of FFV is exactly just that. Also, like with the other early FFs, this game is appropriately-paced. You can see and do everything in a reasonable amount of time. This, in my opinion, makes FF5 the kind of game that you could afford to devote one play-through a year to. <br><br>As for this port of the game...well...eh...I don't like it. At first I was stunned to silence by the awful interlacing, the frame-rate*, and the fact that mashing the fight command can sometimes lead to characters choosing to defend, switch rows, or ???? As I recall, the last time something like that happened was in FFIV: Advance, and I was not happy with that port either. After enough time, I got past these issues and beat this edition of the game, but it's still disappointing. <br><br>I'm of mixed opinions on the sprites. As always, the enemies look great, but the characters look weird. Aside from the jarring inconsistencies (Why did they use Amano's artwork for the portraits?), the actual character sprites are just strange at times. To give an example: Bartz always has this &quot;RAWR!&quot; face whenever he raises his hands in the air. This happens at several points in the story, like when he's breaking free from something, celebrating, or is getting pumped up. This is getting really nitpicky, but it showcases what I prefer about FFV's original sprites. The characters in FFV are expected to show a wide range of emotions, but they're tiny sprites with a dozen animation frames between them. However, this simplicity works to the story's advantage, because you can always tell the current mood of the situation. With this version all I can think about is &quot;Why does Bartz get angry so often?&quot; as he gesticulates wildly like Stan S. Stanman.<br><br>Overall, this port of FFV is serviceable, but it deserves better. This is a fantastic JRPG, one of the best of its kind, but it's the victim of yet another lazy port. Maybe one day Square-enix will get the bright idea to hire M2 or a similar team to do their previous games justice. Still, it could be worse...it could always be worse.<br><br>*Yep. I will complain about the frame-rate in an RPG, especially if it's worse than the previous edition's.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21342918', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21342918' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21342918\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21342918' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21342918\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21342918', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21342918_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21342918_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18234402\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"114186327\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccd6c2a023ebc9f2e1acd30705ead6fdb532de12.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccd6c2a023ebc9f2e1acd30705ead6fdb532de12.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccd6c2a023ebc9f2e1acd30705ead6fdb532de12_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/\" data-miniprofile=\"114186327\">NekoGala<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/games\/?tab=all\">283 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/urbangala\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHave never played any of the Final Fantasys before 7 till they came out on steam (besides the gba port of 1 and 2).

The pace is fine bit of a slow start but actually one of the quicker ones in final fantasy games.<br>Difficulty isnt really a thing, you will walk through the game and have a few difficult battles but unfortunately not many. The good news is that this has more to do with the sheer amount of different strategies you can use once you get into the game. This is owing to the job system which is my favourite in the main series though some of the off-shoots such as tactics are much more fun imo.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18230145', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18230145' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18230145\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18230145' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18230145\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18230145', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18230145_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18230145_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22616639\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BeyondHeretic\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"26246225\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b417da2e14ee30f8a204d7e47491c72408aaa6b1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b417da2e14ee30f8a204d7e47491c72408aaa6b1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b417da2e14ee30f8a204d7e47491c72408aaa6b1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BeyondHeretic\/\" data-miniprofile=\"26246225\">\u2728Beyond Heretic\u2728<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BeyondHeretic\/games\/?tab=all\">514 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BeyondHeretic\/recommended\/\">269 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BeyondHeretic\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFinal Fantasy 5 is often considered one of the &quot;Forgotten&quot; Final Fantasies. It wasn't properly released stateside for many years and as a result very few played it compared to the vastly more popular 6 and 7.<br><br>5 was a very natural progression of mechanics from 3 and 4. It took the job system from previous games and gave it a new spin. Now in 5 you could switch out your class at will. And you would gain XP in a particular class which would level it up and gain it abilities. Which you could swap in and out with other classes. It's a very modular game that lets you play it in whatever way you could concievably want. Like you can play the game with 4 warriors while still having 4 white mage skills attatched to them. You unlock jobs gradually throughout the game and there are even hidden ones.<br><br>The story to 5 feels like a spiritual predecessor to 6. It features things like multiple overworlds and a floating island at one point. But it's in general a more simple and straight forward story. It's a better paced and shorter game overall, and one that can appeal to newcomers of the franchise a lot more than some of the more intimidating later entries. The characters in 5 are all likeable and memorable enough. The only real thing I'd say that holds 5 back is the game feels a little samey overtime and I feel like if it lacked it's job system it would've really gotten dull. If you're exclusively playing FF5 for it's story it won't hold your attention as well as 6 and 7 do.<br><br>The port for FF5 on PC is based on the iOS remake that released some time ago. The sprites were completely redrawn alongside the user interface and character portraits. It also includes the additional content that came with the GBA port of FF5. I'd recommend finding a mod that disables the character portraits since they don't match the sprites and were based on the concept art for the game, so they look very out of place compared to the more modern sprites the game has. It also doesn't feature mouse control so if that's a turn off for you I'd suggest not purchasing this port.<br><br>It's a fine JRPG and if you can find it for a good price I recommend it a great deal.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22616639', 'summary' );

This review is primarily intended to adress the concerns I had myself from reading other reviews before I purchased the game - hopefully someone in a similar position will find it useful! Now onwards!<br><br>Story<br><br>One thing that held me off from playing FF5 for many years was the thought that the older FF games had very little in terms of story, and the story is in my opinion the number 1 reason to play the franchise. This was further reinforced by constantly hearing how FF5 had the worst story of the bunch (perhaps excluding 1-3), I can tell you that I was WRONG. Whether the story is as good as the others remains to be seen, but it is definitely there, it's engaging and I can't wait to see what happens next. The main difference between FF5's story and FF6's is in the content, you will still get the same amount of story. Cutscenes happen regularly and within the first few hours I have already laughed many times and cried twice. It is definitely a Final Fantasy story.<br><br>Graphics<br><br>I think most of us (or at least me) who go back to experience the classics want it to be as close to the original as possible, we want to be able to say &quot;FF5? Oh yes, I played that.&quot; and that's why im a bit on the fence on the 3D remakes that 3 and 4 has, how different can you make a game before it's a different game entirely? Yet on the flipside the originals are so out dated at this point even for retro fans who don't emphatise the graphics it can become a distraction.<br>Well, no such problems here! You get the same old 2D designs just sharpened and updated without to many creative liberties and &quot;improvements&quot;, which is perfect to me. And let me tell you, the game looks gorgeous, with the HD sprites and beautiful spell effects the game ages so much better than the later 3D installments.<br>The number 1 complaint you will see about the graphics are the tile seams and yes, they are really bad at certain parts - but unless you are intentionally trying to be a critic, you'll quickly get used to it and not even notice it. The only time I actively thought about it was when I saw a big rock with terrible seams, travelling around flat surfaces like sand, floors, grass there's no problem. <br>Is this enough not to want to support this release and pick up another? I'll leave that up to you, I am only here to tell you that from a gamers point of view it does not take away any enjoyment.<br><br>The thing that bothered me personally the most.. The character portraits look nothing like their ingame sprites! Now the thing that bothers me the most about this is that I want to imagine a character like they are actually supposed to look, when someone mentiones Faris I want to have an image of Faris pop into my head and not some random art that the developers felt like using..<br>However, from what I understand the portraits are actually made from original concept art for the game - so even though they look different from the sprites, perhaps they actually do look like the character was intended to look? From what I hear many of the ingame sprites will typically look exaggerated because otherwise it would be hard to tell sprites apart in it's original low resolution. Spinning it this way, the idea became acceptable to me and the portrait art isn't bad by any means, personally I think it's beautiful.<br>In the end there is no real HD content out there to show us what FF5 characters really are supposed to look like in full glory, and there probably never will be.<br><br>Post-review addition: I almost forgot, but one issue I had was that the game had a white line across the left and top side of the screen when running full-screen, it was very distracting. I easily solved it by grabbing a program which lets you run borderless windowed mode in full size, basically simulated full-screen and it works like a charm and is very easy to set up. However it does mean running a third party program with your game. Something i personally hate to have to do.<br>I'd personally not want to play the game with that line, so I highly suggest fixing it the way I did if you do not plan on playing windowed or have an easy time ignoring annoyances like that.<br><br>Gameplay<br><br>Let me start out with saying this game is BRUTAL in terms of difficulty compared to all the later games in the franchise. Now there are two reasons for this, the first one being that the game is simply designed to be more challenging than the later games - most games from this era was.<br>Secondly, the way the job system works lets you easily change classes on the fly and as such I think they kind of expect you to change jobs to suit the area you are going to or the boss you are going to take on. But I am the kind of person who likes to make my perfect and well balanced setup that I enjoy and keep it that way, as such I am obviously intentionally making things harder for myself.<br>Using one example I faced I fire boss who was weak to ice and resistant to physical attacks, obviously this boss would have been a lot easier if I simply made my warriors into spellcasters who could cast ice spells, in not doing so the battle was a lot harder. This is not really a bad thing though, it is just a point for consideration. Personally I really enjoy the added challenge and will keep playing my way - but know that if you do the same and a boss is too hard, there are options availiable to you.<br>There are many more examples I could give but it all boils down too: The game wants you to switch jobs on the fly, but you don't have to if you like a challenge.<br><br>UI\/Controls<br><br>Not much to say here really, some people don't like the combat menus but I think they look better than the originals. However I will say that the fonts during conversations is way to big, I wish I could change that. It is quite clear that it was designed for handheld devices, it really should be scaleable in the options.<br>The keyboard controls works great and are entirely customizeable, however they suffer the same issue as most FF ports seem to, that is if you bind your confirm key to a letter, when you type in someones name and press confirm it adds a later, so if for an example like me you have confirm on E, when you confirm Bartz name you will get Bartze. It's annoying but fortunately in this game you only get to name 1 character anyway so you can change the controls and change them back after. <br><br>Conclusion<br><br>It's a Final Fantasy game, if you enjoyed other classics in the franchise you will certainly enjoy this one. As a game it gets full points and you'll get way more hours of entertainment for your money than most modern games will give you.<br>Whether or not you should buy it comes down to your feelings on half arsed ports, it has some flaws, however for 15\u20ac (7\u20ac on sale right now) what you get is more than worth the price in my opinion. There is no question the game itself is worth the price, the only thing to consider is whether you want to support this particular port, i'd personally have no problem paying 7\u20ac for HD textures alone so I'd say don't nitpick and go for it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29938883', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29938883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29938883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29938883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29938883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29938883', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29938883_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29938883_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29396770\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198156253850\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"195988122\">Severa<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 44.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor Gilgamesh it's morphing time!

Let's start with the good game. Final Fantasy V may be one of the least favourites and more obscure titles, but i truly love this game. The story, contrary to many reviewers, is fun and engaging. Sure, it isn't deep or anything, but it's there and gets the job more than done. The same applies to the characters, both main and NPCs. But of course, what truly shines in this game is the job system, designed in a way that you can equip certain job exclusive abilities into other unrelated jobs, creating a huge amount of experimentation, and some combos are simply amazing. What i also enjoy here is the music, which is another masterpiece from Nobuo Uematsu. Final Fantasy V is a great and complete RPG which shoudn't be dismissed by fans of the genre.<br>But should it be the Steam version? I'll be honest right away: i didn't found this version to be terrible. I played in a windowed mode with a controller, and enjoyed playing this to 100% in this version, getting all items and achievements (which is a nice addition). But... to me the game didn't launch at first. There's an issue with the game only recognizing standard English characters for the Windows account name, and in order to play the game i had to create another account just to play this, which is absurd. That left a bad taste in my mouth, but besides that my experience was good the entire time. The auto-save makes the game very easy though (saving after each battle) and it doesn't delete itself when loaded as advertised. And speaking of saves, make sure to back-up your save manually, because the Steam Could only saves the main settings, which is also absurd. The price is also expensive considering it's age and that it's a mobile port (the main complain that everyone has). The port it's obvious, but it didn't distracted me. I even enjoyed the updated sprites (but not the character portraits). So, on sale, if you really want Final Fantasy V on your Steam library you can get it. It's a bad port, but the game is completely playable, or at least it was for me after the launch issue that i described earlier. If you really want it, go for it.

Awesome Final Fantasy end of the world style storytelling, dungeon crawling, grinding, hour sucking, addictive gameplay.... I stopped playing halfway through because I realized I hadn't slept or had a life in about a week.... But then I realized I had to level everyone to 99 to feel good about myself and jumped back in; over 90 hours later I finally finished leveling jobs and characters and finally got the last secret boss..... BUT THAN I REALIZED I ONLY HAD 99% OF THE FREAKING TREASURE!!!!!!!! i doubt I'll play this game again in this decade just because of that, or not.... nah I'll probably play it again, the only annoyance would be that stupid super dragon at the end.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28232361', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28232361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28232361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28232361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28232361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28232361', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28232361_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28232361_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28225969\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198161191135\/recommended\/382890\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"200925407\">Ryu Fireheart<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 110.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNot many people talk about Final Fantasy V, but it has one of the best stories of the series.
