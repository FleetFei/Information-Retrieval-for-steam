Will you survive long enough to make use of any of it?<br><br>Helpful, responsive developer.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>Tedious, at times infuriating looting system that trolls you and can cause campaign restarts.  Your commandos only have 9 slots, most of which will be filled with essential items, which means you'll spend a lot of time micromanaging inventory space to pick up loot after battle.  Missions will abruptly end before you can reclaim deployed equipment\/pick up loot.  I'd kill for an option just to have all discovered\/deployed items on the floor automatically looted after a successful mission.. it's all just unnecessary downtime that gets in the way of the tense combat .<br><br>Weird, arbitrary firing angle rules on the majority of weapons\/firing modes, limiting your shots  to UDLR and diagonals. Granted a token few are simply LOS, but the vast majority use the &quot;star&quot; aiming system.  Overwatch\/defend mode and monsters completely ignore these limitations.<br><br><br>The visuals are what you'd expect from a one-person project, but combat\/gameplay trumps everything.. and USC has damn good combat.

It's not entirely perfect, but even then what few mistakes it makes are primarily in the UI, the writing and the walls of text in the tutorial, they all manage to feed that nostalgic, retro feel. Everything else fits in perfectly. Creatio 39 has managed to create an old fashioned turn based tactical game, keeping all the things we used to love while not being a slave to it. The game has learned from the mistakes of previous generations, built upon them, and it tells.<br><br>The balance of the game feels solid. It can be a little jarring to newcomers to see that even the easiest enemies can take several rounds and plenty of ammo to kill, but it serves to create a surprisingly frantic and intense experience -- even when you can take all the time in the world. The enemies are always crashing down on you, your ammo is always in limited supply, and the battlefield is in constant motion.<br><br>The battlefield, on that note, is a fantastic part of the game. It's incredibly dynamic. When the enemies can't reach you, they'll chew through crates, barrels doors and walls to get to you. Holding them off requires not only plenty of situational awareness. You'll need to watch the walls, look for cracks, identify which ones are the closest to collapsing. But more than that, both you and the enemy can partake in a bit of area denial tactics.<br><br>Some of the monsters when killed will leave behind patches of radiation. Stepping into those will give you a long lasting damage-over-time effect that'll tick your health down every turn. On the flip side, you've got kerosene on your side. Not only can you push and pull barrels around, you can actually drain them into your inventory, then splash them onto the ground. You can coat hallways and rooms in this flammable liquid - and it'll do exactly what you think. However, keeping them in the barrels lets you shoot and set off a single point, dealing extra damage. That, however, means pushing and pulling it into position.<br><br>Crates of ammo can be another terrific tool. You can use them to get a full clip of ammo into your currently held weapon, or as improvised explosives. These can be extremely powerful against groups of enemies, it's just the question of how badly you want the ammo it holds.  With all these different elements going on, it's no surprise that when fire gets mixed in, things get frantic. Suddenly your soldiers have to dance between walls of flame, puddles of radiation and the enemies themselves, all the while having to worry about setting off any remaining explosives and crumbling walls.<br><br>The game is hard, but it never feels like you've been cheated when something goes wrong. The balance is fair. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do it gives you a very rewarding experience. This is a game that rewards you for being able to adapt to different situations, for being able to recover control when things go wrong and for knowing when to give up and fall back.<br><br>For any fan of turn based tactics, I recommend this game heartily.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15859565', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15859565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15859565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15859565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15859565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15859565', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15859565_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15859565_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15875465\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970434679\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10168951\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8a5ba66799a26337ef946ac54a20bc853519c406.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8a5ba66799a26337ef946ac54a20bc853519c406.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8a5ba66799a26337ef946ac54a20bc853519c406_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970434679\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10168951\">Kittenbait<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970434679\/games\/?tab=all\">110 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970434679\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970434679\/recommended\/341910\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">95.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a tactical squad game in the mould of classics like Rebelstar (if you're old enough to remember that), Laser Squad and XCOM or, more recently, Halfway. It doesn't perhaps expand on them a great deal. You do the usual of equipping your squad with a range of weaponry and other equipment, finding upgrades, crafting materials and protoypes to get better weaponry, whilst gunning down aliens en masse on te tactical map. A game doesn't really need to expand on something like Laser Squad to be good fun. And this is mostly true of USC.<br><br>Killing aliens seems to be a case of expending huge amounts of ammo; clicking lots of times for low-cost shots that knock of relatively small amounts of health. This gives the game a certain attractive aesthetic I quite like of marines pouring vast quantities of lead at hordes of aliens. On the other hand, it also takes quite a lot of time and makes it seem like a bit of a grind. Aliens explode into blood splats (often toxic radioactive blood that is dangerous to step into), and the playing area rapidly fills up. Preparation is a big part of USC: you have to make sure you go into a level with the right weapons, equipment and enough ammo, otherwise you'll be in trouble.<br><br>However, USC is rather a mess. The UI is undoubtedly clumsy. Sure, you'll learn to navigate it at least reasonably smoothly, but it should be better. Everything is graphically cluttered: the interface, the levels which are totally full of stuff and frequent narrow corridors (reminiscent of Space Hulk). I find the procedurally drawn levels have annoying bugs: corridors without access except by destroying walls; once my marines arrived into a level and the start room opened straight into half a dozen crates blocking the passageway that I had to destroy before I could go anywhere. I'm not sure how well worked many levels are: some listed the resistance as &quot;low&quot; and yet my squad of four ended up permanently swarmed by aliens (aliens can spawn: no matter how many I killed, there seemed to still be another 40 left) until I ran out of ammo and\/or medkits. Unless the mission is some sort of hold out as long as possible (and it wasn't), this is more tedious than it is fun.<br><br>In the end, I think USC is a significantly flawed and slightly frustrating game that falls well short of what it could have been, and in some ways less fun than its stylistic ancestors. Nevertheless, if you like this sort of Laser Squad type of game, you'll find something to enjoy, and it has some promise that I hope the developers build on.<br><br>It is with these caveats and the modest price tag I just about recommend it; I would be far less forgiving were it more expensive.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15875465', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15875465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15875465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15875465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15875465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15875465', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15875465_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15875465_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15828045\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198071927590\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"111661862\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198071927590\/\" data-miniprofile=\"111661862\">Yograin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198071927590\/games\/?tab=all\">274 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198071927590\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198071927590\/recommended\/341910\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">48.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 14, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn interesting game with some intense combat and roguelike dead system.

The combat similarly seemed very chaotic at first (especially when I jumped right into a one-off single mission with hordes of weird aliens - I tried to hide in my elevator but they started eating through the walls and electrocuting me and who knows what. But then I started the campaign and tutorial scenario and it was nice and slow and full of skippable explanations and things made sense from there out. Now there is still often all sorts of chaos, but it makes sense and I get what's going on even when monsters are eating through nearby walls and chain reactions of fuel and ammunition are ripping through a base and setting monsters on fire who go running away while other types come creeping in, etc...<br><br>It has most of the things I want in such a game, including many that are fairly hard to find all in one game:<br><br>* A campaign where you can manage your squad, trying to keep them alive through many battles, see them improve through experience and adjust their equipment and so on.<br>* Enough challenge and risk and permadeath, and no expectation to savescum\/replay when things go wrong.<br>* More or less fully destructable environment, where missed shots and violence damage everything - walls and doors and objects, accidental &quot;friendly&quot; fire, etc.<br>* Tactics that mostly make sense and arise naturally from simulating the situation in ways that mostly make sense, with overwatch, use of cover and doors, a variety of weapon effects and skills, etc.<br>* Interesting, meaningful, and logical choices both at the tactical level and between missions.<br>* Freedom to try various approaches, as far as weapons and tactics, but also taking time to rest and repair at the risk the aliens will come after your base, etc.<br>* In the campaign, you manage 16 men but only use one or two squads per mission, so you can choose who to send on attacks, who to leave behind resting or doing repairs, and whether to try to get experience for the greener people or not.<br>* Nice relative absence of contrived scenarios and hoops to jump through, compared to some games. More of a chaotic simulation feel, which I like, though also with a fun\/gamey\/dark-humorous flavor.<br>* Details of ammo\/equipment management, but not too much.<br><br>One great thing I didn't expect is the Defend The Base mode, which lets you set up a base and try to defend it against increasingly stronger waves of aliens, with damage details (including spilled fuel and acid and so on) being carried over, and limited resources to repair or re-arrange things, and an option to retreat rather than hold once the position seems untennable. Nice!<br><br>Also, the game is still in development and the developer is listening and adding some things that players have asked for, which is awesome, and in my very long experience with games, is what makes for the best games. For example, one thing that was jarring to me was the firing arcs of some weapons, which were limited during one's own turn to firing along straight or diagonal grid lines, which the developer had an interesting intention for doing, but which seemed unnatural to me (in contrast to the way most of the rest of the game works in ways I would expect, in nice detail, in fact). Turns out in response to player comments, they are working for an option to not do that, for players who don't want it, which may be in the next patch. Sweet!<br><br>I have a few gripes but nothing major. The odd firing arcs of some weapons was probably my biggest nitpick. The looting and inventory manipulation can be a bit fiddly but it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and I quite appreciate all the detail and choices. I could even wish it were more fiddly, as I find the recycler and manufacturing of new items during the campaign is very generous and I'd be interested to have to make do more with what I find. (Though without the recycler\/manufacturer the lack of storage slots would become an issue.) Mainly I'd just like more of the same. I expect I will eventually have had enough for a while and wish for another campaign, but for now I'm happily hooked.<br><br>Anyway, I quite recommend Ultimate Space Commando!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19465100', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19465100' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19465100\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19465100' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19465100\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19465100', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19465100_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19465100_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15876365\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197963664525\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"3398797\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8ca9c1a6a43858bc33e358f8ae11a39708ca44bc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8ca9c1a6a43858bc33e358f8ae11a39708ca44bc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8ca9c1a6a43858bc33e358f8ae11a39708ca44bc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197963664525\/\" data-miniprofile=\"3398797\">Terkala<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197963664525\/games\/?tab=all\">655 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197963664525\/recommended\/\">68 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197963664525\/recommended\/341910\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA surprisingly well made game. It doesn't have high production values, as you can see from the screenshots. But it's enough to get you into the setting and convey the information you need.<br><br>The gameplay seems well balanced so far. Though the tutorial does start you with far less ammunition than you would want. It allows a lot of customization in terms of what kinds of weapons you want on your squad, and what other support equipment. And specialization of your characters into different roles.<br><br>Destructable terrain and explosives play heavily into the tactics. It becomes very important to set up your fights so they take place in the right area. But even so, it doesn't feel like a game where &quot;one mistake costs you the game&quot;, which is one of my least favorite of the xcom alike mechanics.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15876365', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15876365' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15876365\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15876365' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15876365\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15876365', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15876365_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15876365_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16382221\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198197832859\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"237567131\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198197832859\/\" data-miniprofile=\"237567131\">sharani<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198197832859\/games\/?tab=all\">5 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198197832859\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198197832859\/recommended\/341910\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 14, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've been playing USC since Beta and I find it a very complex, elaborated and pleasantly old-school game. My favourite modes are &quot;Single Mission&quot; and &quot;Defend the Base!&quot;, because my team can do very well and I can play with it in both modes.  I'm very excited for my team to survive especially when a Wunderwurm attacks us.<br><br>And you can distribute skill points to set up your units for different roles (medic, heavy, technician, etc.). You have certain amount of credits, which sometimes makes it a challenge to buy everything you need, but this also makes the game very exciting.<br><br>In &quot;Defend the Base!&quot; mode you have to make sure that you use everything you can, because each wave is stronger and stronger (e.g. having turrets is very useful). It is also very good that you can repair your base and build new rooms or walls - between the waves.<br><br>I recommend this game for everyone who likes complex tactics with a lot of possibilities and high stakes (and being bullied by a worm, after you survived dozens of reapers).<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16382221', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16382221' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16382221\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16382221' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16382221\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16382221', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16382221_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16382221_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22759462\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">Warwick J.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/games\/?tab=all\">4,672 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/\">269 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/341910\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">29.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSteamified \u00bb Indie Spotlight \u00bb Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>  BY STEAMIFIED APRIL 12, 2016 INDIE SPOTLIGHT<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br><br><br>Developer\tCreatio 49\tPublisher\tAngry Cat Ltd.<br>Release Date\t13 May, 2015\tGenre\tIndie, RPG, Strategy, Turn-based Tactics<br>Official Website\tTwitter\tFacebook\tSteam<br>STEAMIFIED IN A NUTSHELL<br>Ultimate Space Commando marks the Steam debut of Creatio 49. It\u2019s a turn-based tactics game that has been set in the era of early interstellar colonization. You\u2019re looking at a small indie team\u2019s attempt to enter the same genre as the XCOM franchise among others. Somewhat surprisingly their take on the genre is more polished and enjoyable than I thought that it was going to be. Similar to other games within the genre, players have the opportunity to customize four-troop squads with weapons, ammunition and tools. While the core of the gameplay is turn-based there is a well implemented RPG-style management system.<br><br>There is a lengthy campaign mode which I have yet to complete but I can tell you that it is immersive and is soundly designed. The basis of the campaign is controlling the fate of the crew of the U.S.C. ship Wraith which is a recon vessel stranded on an isolated mining planet. It\u2019s your a typical first contact scenario that, of course, poses the greatest risk to the survival of humanity. There are over thirty missions \u2013 of varying length \u2013 within the campaign \u2013 so to suggest that there are many hours worth of content within the campaign alone would be considered an understatement.<br><br>A fantastic touch by the developers was making the combat environment fully interactive. What this feature actually does is enable a superior level of strategy than would otherwise be possible. The interactive environments work hand in hand with the deep combat mechanics and squad management tools. Incorporated into the combat system are four statistics that are all of significant importance \u2013 health, morale, action points and armor as well as nine attributes that have essentially been stripped from an RPG game. The amount of weapon types (18) and gadgets (30+) help make the game one of the deepest strategy games that I\u2019ve ever played. It all works exceedingly well and although it may lack the polish of an XCOM it is well and truly worth your time if you are in any way enamored with the genre. If you\u2019re not then the earlier levels will serve as a great learning tool for the game.<br><br>Of course, there are further game modes beyond the campaign including defend the base and an almost limitless single mission structure where the size of the map, difficulty, player handicaps, the objectives and more are all able to be customized. My personal favorite game mode, even ranking it ahead of the great campaign, is the defend the base mode. In this mode you have to build your base while incorporating resource management and survive wave after wave of alien attacks.<br><br>There are trading cards to be harvested and multiplayer availability. Unfortunately the developers are yet to incorporate Steam achievements into their game but their definitely is the potential of them being added. In regards to the multiplayer game there was a season one competitive mode. Season two is being planned but the developers are hoping to get a larger player base so that they can make that even more challenging and engaging than the exciting first season. I\u2019m certain that Lt. Commander Bozdo will be back to defend his crown.<br><br>Ultimate Space Commander is one of the deepest games that we\u2019ve covered to date.

Quite a bit of micro, and lots of freedom to do what you want. It's a yes.<br><br>Review Proper:<br><br>Ultimate Space Commando is a bit deceiving. The name sounds like a weird Japanime crossover thing that's gotta be horribly translated, and the graphics are kinda ugly, even for a retro-esque game like this. That said, the gameplay itself is great, the freedom the mechanics offer is pretty hard to match, and it's certainly addictive.<br><br>The concept is pretty simple - you've crashlanded on a far away planet, and need to escape. To do this, you need to fight through enemies, collect materials, and maybe uncover some answers as to what's been happening. You'll upgrade your gear on the way, meet increasingly scary [s]sprites[\/s] monsters matched only in their deadly-ness by their ugliness, and uncover little bits of a surprisingly well translated story on the way.<br><br>As many have mentioned, it plays a lot like older X-Com, Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm, etc. etc. As of such, there's some great stuff, some stuff you might love or might hate, and some meh stuff.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>First off, this is currently about the same price of a pack of smokes. That's never bad, particularly when the game is actually good, like this one is.<br><br>The combat is interesting, and the &quot;18 distinct weapons&quot; are actually pretty distinct. Even the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 starting guns can be upgraded to respectable death machines with their own advantages. That's kinda cool.<br><br>The story is good for this kind of game - for one, it actually exists, and for two, it's reasonably coherent.<br><br>Dev support is great. Think I waited something like 3 hours to have my question answered. Given that you'll often only hear the words &quot;there's only one dev&quot; followed by some excuse as to why it shouldn't matter that a game sucks, is broken, or what have you, it's actually pretty mindblowing when you consider that this lady has managed to make a game that suffers from none of the above, is more indepth and packed with features than most multi-dev projects in the same genre, and is just genuinely good, while still having time to reply directly to the fanbase in a prompt manner.<br><br>It's <b>HOTSEAT MULTIPLAYER<\/b>. Seriously, why the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 are all games like this, not to mention turn based 4x games, not hotseat multiplayer anymore?<br><br>The mechanics run deep.<br><br>You generally don't die because something utterly unfair has happened. Sometimes you get unlucky, but usually, you just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up.<br><br>There's really alot of good to say about this game, but the store page itself lays most of it out very well, so there's no need for me to do it again.<br><br>The Mixed:<br><br>You need to buy and manually equip every bullet you fire, every healthpack you use, and literally anything else you might expend in a mission. I don't mind this, because I grew up when games were like this, but some people might.<br><br>You have a very limited inventory. Your guys can only carry what they can carry in nine inventory slots, and you can only store nine things at your base. There are some good mechanics to help you not lose out on potential loot during a mission - namely that materials are automatically picked up at the end of most missions, and you can &quot;field salvage&quot; weapons and stuff for a percentage of their value if you don't have room to pack them back - but if you like to hoard stuff, you might find this irritating.<br><br>It's a little punishing. The mechanics run deep, but aren't usually very evident. Part of the fun of these kinds of games can come from figuring stuff out, but there's just some things you can't know until something goes wrong, or unless you ask the devs directly. Or read the manual, but who does that?<br><br>Similarly, the UI is oldschool. It's not as incomprehensible as some of the games it imitates, but it's not incredibly intuitive either. On the flip side of this, it's actually pretty simple once you get the basics down, and thus the learning curve isn't so bad.<br><br>The translation is surprisingly good, but it still seems fairly evident that the writing is either done by a complete amateur, or a non-native english speaker. That really doesn't matter at all to me, since it's still effective in getting the story across, and you're supposed to build your own attachments to your troops in these kinds of games, not have them thrust on you. But it might matter to someone. The only real complaint this causes is that sometimes, instructions are a little unclear.<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>There's not a lot to say here, but a two things do come to mind.<br><br>The fields of fire are messed up. You can only shoot straight, like a rook in chess, unless you're in defensive mode. Then you get a much larger field of fire. I'm guessing there is some reason behind this, but I haven't encountered it yet.<br><br>It's ugly. I couldn't design something prettier, but it's basically animation free, overly sterile, and just not pretty. This usually doesn't matter to me in games, and likely wouldn't here if the graphics style was something else, but I just don't like it much.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>All in all, this is really a hidden gem. It's cheap, has hotseat and online multiplayer, great gameplay, and tons of replayability. It's a really good game that catches the feel and style of 1990s turn based games very well, without descending into mediocre mechanics and design flaws.<br><br>I should also mention that there's a ton of other features such as an annual tournament, a series of challenge and other game modes, and a bunch of other neat crap I didn't touch on in the review because I haven't played around with them yet. There's a good bit of content I don't even know about, personally.<br><br>If this is your type of game, then you may find this is the best ten bucks or so you'll ever spend on Steam.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26238955', 'recent_short' );

It is a game designed for pure strategy fans like myself taking ideas from games like XCOM. <br>Ultimate Space Commando gives you a squad to play around with just like XCOM. Your squad members have landed in a hostile territory which seems to be crawling around with aliens of all sorts. The story in USC is pretty generic considering the theme and there are few meaningful choices in the midst of the campaign. The campaign itself is pretty lengthy and is a blast to play through. It is told through written dialogues instead of cutscenes which is understandable. Various ways to handle a situation come as a shining star in the gameplay. There are various choices and tactics based on your squad, weapons etc. <br>It also has a permadeath system for your squad members if you notch the difficulty up a bit. You manage 16 members throughout the campaign from which you can select whom to take on the mission and who will stay back and look after your base. There is even a surprisingly fun Defend your base where you set up a base and try to defend it from the increasingly difficult hoard of aliens. <br>                                               Another thing USC gets right is the environmental backdrop set up for your battles. It sets the mood right for the one more turn fights and also gives a sense of dread for your squad. Deep customization and depth in characters are all present in USC<br>The gameplay of USC is very fun but what lets it down is the amount of bugs present throughout the game. Frequent crashes and screen freezes also are very common. The amount of bugs present makes it feel like a  beta test or an unchecked game of some kind. That\u2019s a real same though as the original game present beneath all those bugs is really great.<br>I am surprised at how a game as good as USC is still not known to the majority of the people even an year after its release.

The goal, or at least the intention, is to get back to civilization safe and sound. Dialogue mostly happens at the beginning of missions, and is of little importance. 5\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Game Modalities<\/div><br>There are also alternative game modes (defend the base\/play random map) the can be played on co-op. The campaign itself is around 30h or more, the replay value is also quite good. 7\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Character Development, Stats &amp; Equipment<\/div><br>There aren't different classes, but different ranks based on the experience level. You gain more experience on the field, depending on inflicted damage, and special actions, such as hacking secure doors, closing hatches, etc. When soldiers gain a level of experience, they get skill points to distribute on a number of skills (melee\/small arms\/heavy weapons, reaction, engineering, biochemistry and all sorts of skills you can expect in a turn based game). Different soldiers have also a specialization, that makes them better in a certain role. New equipment is salvaged from the field, including blueprints for new kinds of ammo, new weapons, new gear or special weapon prototypes. Moreover, on the field you'll be able to salvage special components used to craft prototypes or other gear. This feature is slightly annoying because you have to manually pick everything up, it get tedious especially for screws and other crafting material. Another aspect to ponder is that the gear found on the field can be extremely random. In my first playthrough, I found the automated turret (a very powerful piece of equipment) near the end of the campaign, while in my second run I found it in the second mission. There's a good variety of weapons and ammo types. 7\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Combat and Gameplay<\/div><br>The combat system is indeed the core of the game. The most peculiar aspect is that all weapons have distinct fire modes, that in turn may have different firing patterns (for example 'star' means cardinal direction plus diagonals, 'free' can reach any square that isn't blocked etc.) and different area of effect (single square, 3x3, 5x5, along a line etc.). I was sceptical at first because I wanted to be able to shoot everywhere my line of sight allowed me to, but after a while I can say it's a very good system, it makes all weapons uique and soldiers with different weapons will have to cover different roles. There's also a wide range of ammunition calibres and types (incendiary, armor piercing, marker tranquilizing, etc). You'll often find ammo crates or kerosene barrels, that can catch fire and explode. Morale plays also a big role, there's a morale requirement for anything that isn't shooting (moving, using items, entering defend mode, etc.)<br>Many lesser aliens leave on death a radioactive substance that will poison you if you enter a square covered with it (you can clear it with fire or moving a crate over the said square). And fire, that can damage you and the aliens. Pathfinding is quite good, dangerous square (with fire or radiation) will be avoided by default, and the UI will warn you if you will take damage in your chosen path.<br>Another big plus is that there is a real lighting system: aliens in the dark, when they can be seen, are more difficult to hit. Later in the game, a kind of alien appears that projects darkness all around itself, making it and the nearby aliens much more difficult to hit (there's a pistol that can shoot flare ammunition).<br>Most missions are of the 'seek and destroy' type, only a few have some more interesting goal. 9\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics and Sound <\/div><br>Graphics are in pure 2D, the alien sprites and the backgrounds are well drawn, your soldiers not as much. Animations are non-existent, except for explosions. The music of the main menu sets the right atmosphere, but the in-game music does everything it can to ruin it. Sound effects on the other hand are very good, again with the exception of the voices of your soldiers when they're wounded. 5\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">User Interface<\/div><br>Very old-fashioned. There is a total lack of tool-tips, and the tutorial doesn't help you much to understand it. There's no way to know if an alien has been poisoned or suffers damage over time, or its armor. Sometimes you can read its hit points (probably skill-related). There are also some 'undocumented' features, by pure chance I discovered I could split stacks in my inventory right-clicking on an empty square. On the plus side, all keys are customizable. After you get used to it, it's all right, but a less wordy and more to-the-point tutorial would help you understand it better. 5\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Enemies' Variety, AI &amp; Difficulty <\/div><br>The basic enemy types are not plentiful, but each of them can be seen in a lot of varieties. Some of them may have increased armor, health, action points, life stealing attacks, explode after death and other attributes. They are named in a way that remembers Tales of Maj'Eyal. Interestingly, the most powerful aliens will have their turn split in two phases, the second of which is processed after all other aliens have moved. 6\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Interactivity of the Environment <\/div><br>Pretty much everything on the field is destructible, you can also pull or push crates or barrels around to raise a barricade or to clear radiation. You can pick objects from the ground, or pass them from soldier to soldier. I've already mentioned the lighting system. Definitely one of the strong points of the game. 8\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Immersion<\/div><br>Immersion isn't too good, mostly because of the lacking music and the thin background story. Also, it takes some time to get used to the interface, the firing patterns and the various gameplay elements. The developer has a sympathy for ducks, and in the maps you'll find some 'vendor machines' that can boost your health, action points or morale. This can take away a bit of the 'seriousness' and\/or the immersion, depending on your tastes, but I can't say it bothered me. Could be better, but not too important. 6\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Bugs<\/div><br>Unfortunately it hasn't been a bug-free experience for me. There are some CTDs, luckily harmless because the games always saves before crashing. I suggest you don't use the abort\/redo mission feature, because it gave me some nuisances. Only start a mission when you're ready. The developer is present in the forum if you need help, but some bugs still have to be fixed. 5\/10<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> BOTTOM LINE <\/div><br>It takes time to appreciate it. Very challenging at the highest difficulty setting, there are some multiplayer options (that I didn't test) for those who look for some online co-op fun. I have the impression that a game\/campaign editor would greatly benefit the game, but at this time there is none. Rather uneven in its delivery, but tactical combat is definitely brilliant. The price is probably excessive at 20$, maybe reflecting the fact that it's a one-man (woman) project that has been in development for some years. Because of there rare but annoying bugs, you'll also need to be more patient than usual.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> 7\/10 <\/div><br>(if you are a very old-school gamer you can add a point)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22001205', 'recent_short' );
