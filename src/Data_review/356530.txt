Rough around the edges at some points with ulitmately a rewarding set of endings.<\/i><\/div><br><b>My Overall Rating:<\/b> 7\/10<br><br><b>Worth Full Price?<\/b> Well, I personally find the replayability to be adequate for those who are realistic about visual novels. I would say that if the genre is a favourite for you and you typically have the cash to throw at games, you could do a lot worse. When at -50% discount or more, it's a refreshing purchase for a fan of otome.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>General Impressions<\/b><\/div><br>I found the <i>The Royal Trap<\/i> to be a pleasant and amusing way to pass the time. While I've completed all the routes now, I haven't necessarily read every dialogue choice. I also would not mind playing through again in order to read out to my partner. I would be lying if I said the courtly intrigue attempted comes across as a bit daft. Still, it's quite an intriguing experience if you don't mind a bit of fluffiness. Is there room for improvement? Certainly. But I do think this title has encouraged me in my positive views of Hanako Games.<br><br>Contrary to what somebody else stated in a review, I do not find Madeliene to be a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;. Depending on your choices, she can be bested in battle, require assistance, find herself baffled, wind up acting like a complete jerk, wandering into traps, and all sorts. She has merits and flaws. Her strengths turn to weaknesses at important points. Why is she a &quot;dual wielding ninja&quot;? Well, that was how she was trained to be. If she were a man, would we be looking at that aspect with as much scrutiny? Perhaps.<br><br>Still, it's not accurate to suggest she's the idealised version of somebody else, pushed into a stereotypical role. If she were she'd never need the help of her friends. Simply because characters do tend find her charming and clever does not mean that she's &quot;perfect&quot;. And they don't always think of her as such. <br><br>As for the other characters, they range from adequate to amusing\/sassy\/adorable. There is a sinister feel to some of them... up to a point. The <i>really<\/i> treacherous character is only mentioned, never seen. This is one of the failings of the game, I feel. Either way, the rest of the characters have their flaws--though certainly some are less impactful than others--and who do have more than one dimension to them. I personally would have fleshed out areas more yet I can't find it in me to complain too much.<br><br><b>Pros<\/b><br><br>+ Appealing graphics, both for backgrounds and sprites.<br><br>+ Character sprites were not <i>completely<\/i> static.<br><br>+ A fairly coherent plot line with some bizarre twists.<br><br>+ Further playthroughs often add extra information and even when they don't, you still have different conversations and occurrences.<br><br>+ The music is enjoyable (I didn't feel the need to turn it off as I do in many VNs).<br><br>+ Humour\/humourous sitations which generally manage not to overthrow the story's point.<br><br>+ There is at least one Happy, non-romantic ending. You can add your own head-canon to it but that's on you to decide. <br><br><b>Neutral<\/b><br><br>+ If you don't complete all the routes you won't necessarily work out everything that is happening.<br><br>+ I would also have enjoyed further female romance options and for the one which is available to be more &quot;explicit&quot;; there is a rather controversial aspect to the main plot, that sideline could have been added to.<br><br>+ Some of the Happy Endings might be seen as over-the-top?<br><br>+ Some additional sound effects would have been nice although there are enough to get by with.<br><br>+ I feel the rather &quot;out there&quot; plot aspect was handled maturely, however certain dialogue choices could lead to the main character saying things which might upset certain individuals. Those choices lead to a bad ending but they do give the option of seeing the protagonist voicing an opinion in a way that others may not enjoy but is not intentionally cruel.<br><br><b>Cons<\/b> <br><br>+ I would have like to see further expression and movement from the characters.<br><br>+ Reading the fight sequences felt rather tiresome. <br><br>+ People may not enjoy the cliff-hanger aspect of several endings. I was fine with them but I can see why others would not be.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30915314', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30915314' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30915314\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30915314' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30915314\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30915314', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30915314_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30915314_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t160 of 171 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>10 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15286472\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"39466933\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b94de325de1b687e3337fd3dddc4cced47dfca4b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b94de325de1b687e3337fd3dddc4cced47dfca4b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b94de325de1b687e3337fd3dddc4cced47dfca4b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/\" data-miniprofile=\"39466933\">Chudah (DND)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/games\/?tab=all\">2,113 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/recommended\/\">54 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/chudah\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 9, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Royal Trap is Hanako Games' most recent visual novel to make it to Steam, and in my opinion, one of the best games in their catalog.  With gorgeous high quality artwork, great writing and enjoyable soundtrack, there's very little I can complain about when it comes to this gem among OELVNs.  <br><br>In this fictional world of royalty, nobles and commoners, it's the firstborn daughter who inherits the family title, wealth and privilege while the sons must court a wife of similar rank in which to take over, so to speak, power of her household or kingdom.  Queens are referred to as Wisdoms and serve as official advisors to their Kings, an interesting play on the &quot;behind every great man is an even greater woman&quot; saying.  Princesses are groomed for this role so that one day they may provide their own wisdom to the King, assisting him in ruling the kingdom effectively and benevolently.<br><br>With this setting in mind, our story begins with Prince Oscar of Oceandawyr preparing for the <i>Aniversari<\/i> celebrations of Princess Cassidy of Gwellinor.  Among rival princes, he will meet and prospectively court the young princess in the hopes of perhaps winning her hand and Gwellinor's throne.  Madeleine Valois, the second-born daughter of a minor noble house, who through chance of circumstance was awarded the position of Oscar's handler many years prior, has groomed and prepared him for this moment.  Protecting his interests in all things, even to the point of dying for her young master, if needed, her loyalty, devotion and friendship is rivaled by none.  But all of that is put to the test as they both find themselves embroiled in a deadly game of politics with Madeleine's future hanging in the balance.<br><br>Valois' personality and character development is one of the things that makes the story work so well.  Here we have a strong, smart, and for lack of a better word, kick \u2665\u2665\u2665 woman who underneath it all is still caring and gentle when she needs to be.  And although she tries to place logic and reason before all, behind a facade of composure and control there's a woman who has wants and desires, fears for the future, and the dream to one day have her own family, something that seems entirely unattainable in her current situation.  Female protagonist or not, anyone reading this novel should have no problem understanding and relating to her in some way.  <br><br>Each supporting character is just as interesting as Madeleine.  Despite leaning towards standard tropes, they are written uniquely enough to break out of the generic moulds from which they come.  This is refreshing in a genre that relies far too heavily on stereotypes.  It helps that our prospective beaus (and belle, in the case of the maid) are not met with yet another timid and malleable heroine, their actions and reactions reflecting as much.<br><br>The story itself is intrigue-filled with a healthy dose of action sprinkled in.  Piecing together details, formulating theories and guessing at the ultimate outcome only to be shocked as events take a turn for the unexpected, you'll be hooked before you realize it.  The four character routes tell a separate piece of the story, and it's not until you've made it through them all that the how, the what and the why are revealed.  I loved this aspect of the storytelling, although it almost requires a specific route order to get the full effect of the revelations; but I assure you the payoff is well worth it. <br><br>For the guys trying to decide if this &quot;girl's romance&quot; is worth a shot - yes, it most certainly is!  Granted, there is a good bit of romance tossed in, including some pretty steamy situations (this is an otoge after all), but don't let that dissuade you from experiencing an engrossing tale of political intrigue and betrayal.<br><br>The presentation here is excellent with gorgeously detailed artwork and appealing UI.  Of note are the completely redone background images that are far and away better than the originals.  Detail and color come together to complement the character sprites which initially clashed against the sketchiness of the originals.  Event CGs are also extremely well drawn with some beautiful and emotive imagery that truly enhances the story.  These images are accompanied by a very ethnic-sounding acoustic soundtrack with Spanish guitar at its base lending an air of gentility to the game setting.  A minor aside, I really enjoyed the French word usage for some of the terminology; such a small effect goes a long way in establishing a convincing courtly atmosphere.  <br><br>I really cannot champion The Royal Trap enough.  If you enjoy well-crafted visual novels, you need this one in your library.  The price is very reasonable for the quality and length (13 hours to complete all 15 endings is not bad at all).  This is the second time I have played through the entire game, the first over a year ago, and I certainly see myself coming back to re-experience it again in the future.  Do yourself a favor and grab this gem when you can, don't wait for a sale or bundle, The Royal Trap is one visual novel that's definitely worth the full price.<br><br>Bottom Line: Recommended for all visual novel fans who appreciate well written stories with quality presentation behind it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15286472', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15286472' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15286472\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15286472' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15286472\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15286472', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15286472_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15286472_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23053181\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">Faudraline<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/games\/?tab=all\">1,610 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>&quot;We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<\/b><br><br>Hanako Games has been a remarkable name in the otome genre for quite some time now. As being one of Hanako's later games, <i>The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown<\/i> is a marvelously elaborate adventure of royalty, politics, romance, intrigue and alliances in a late medieval fantasy realm - and probably Hanako's best game yet in my personal opinion.<br><br>Our story revolves around Madeleine Valois, a noble born young woman coming from an insignificant family, raised to attend Prince Oscar of Ocendawyr as his valette - a companion, an advisor, an agent and a maidservant. For the occasion of Princess Cassidy's <i>aniversari<\/i> - a celebration for the coming of age and a hosting various suitors to secure her future - Madeleine accompanies Oscar to the neighboring kingdom of Gwellinor. Considering the validity of a female heir is the central power for royalty in this setting, an already fierce race for the hand of Princess Cassidy is on. Yet, Madeleine will also find herself in a web of intrigues threatening not only the integrity of the crown, but the security of her own and her companions. As dangerous gossip concerning many secrets runs within the halls of royal palace, Madeleine tries to choose her allies carefully for her own means. Will she manage to dissolve the web of intrigue, or simply become a part of it to survive?<br><br>Overall, <i>The Royal Trap<\/i> is one of the best otome games both in means of an original setting and story elaboration that I've ever seen. The world and its various ways are depicted befitting 16th century power politics through heirs, names, titles and land with many anecdotes appropriately arranged into a unique setting. All characters are portrayed well beyond skin deep with profound personalities and background. They all are depicted with certain demeanors to establish certain means with unique abilities; possessing dreams, aims, insecurities and hopes which makes every one of them interesting and credible as a personality, breaking out of common stereotypes. Even the most ordinary of them possess their own depths with well written story elaboration.<br><br>Our protagonist, Madeleine is most certainly not our everyday shy and helpless heroine. She is a relatable and able personality with her stature, her training and her character. She is a smart and strong young woman who keeps both her wits and her charms about her. An incredible social player with an ability to observe, analyze and assess situations in the blink of an eye. She is calculating with a novel sense of duty and responsibility, yet she still carries her own worries and desires for the future silently. Her chosen interactions are various and always consistent with her traits. Our job here is to reveal what part of Madeleine's substantial personality will become victorious by the end through our choices. Each and every ending you may acquire feels probable and satisfying with the given personality, which is a masterful feat to accomplish in this genre.<br><br>For display purposes, artworks are genuinely beautiful anime style and CGs themselves are various with suitable expressions. There is no voice acting for any part, yet the soundtrack already establishes a rich and driving atmosphere through a gripping narrative - both describing actual events and commentating on Madeleine's train of thought. It's like reading a really good story with beautiful pictures presented on the side.<br><br>The game has 15 different endings - and a truckload of choice options - presenting alternatives for Madeleine's future and each one sheds some more light to the secrets within palace chambers. I'd highly recommend playing <i>The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown<\/i> for every otome gamer and for whom would appreciate a good visual novel about court politics.

I originally played Royal Trap last year so I knew what to expect from the game, generally, but was excited to see the additions that were made in this version.  I've only finished one route so far but I'mreally pleased in the way the expanded dialogue and text fleshes out the world and the characters in a more comprehensive manner. <br><br>So, with Royal Trap, there's actually 15 different endings: 3 endings per &quot;normal&quot; route, 2 endings on the &quot;hidden&quot; route, and an &quot;alone&quot; route where you don't pursue a relationship. I really enjoyed all four of the &quot;normal&quot; routes, particularly Oscar's which seems to have the most information and action, in terms of world-building (though I assume that's changed some in this version!). <br><br>One thing that makes the setting of the game really unique is that Royal Trap sets up the universe such that there's an interesting hint of matriarchy, in that the power is held by women within the story. I also appreciated that there's actually LGBTQ representation in the game, with two routes that let you choose women and three that let you choose men. There's also more representation specifically with the character of Cassidy, though I don't want to go too in depth as it'll spoil a large portion of the story.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15218343', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15218343' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15218343\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15218343' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15218343\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15218343', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15218343_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15218343_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19029907\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127874396\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"167608668\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/877ac7ca14231ac58c07d30d2a8b5030a3efa8ff.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/877ac7ca14231ac58c07d30d2a8b5030a3efa8ff.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/877ac7ca14231ac58c07d30d2a8b5030a3efa8ff_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127874396\/\" data-miniprofile=\"167608668\">mariskaas<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127874396\/games\/?tab=all\">143 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127874396\/recommended\/\">19 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127874396\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 12, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just recently got into visual novels and this is one of the first I tried. And I really liked it! I just failed to get one ending without internets help, it required very specific choices.<br><br>Pro's<br><br>- Very good intriguing story. To get the whole picture you must play all of the storylines, which are 16 if I remember correctly, but it is worth it!<br>- Some of the endings are really unexpected which I liked a lot!<br>- Your choices actually change the story quite a lot. They are no minor choices, at least most of them and will change the ending most definetely.<br>- The skip system is great, it allows you to skip everything that you have already seen and stops automatically when you encounter something new. Very good especially if you play all storylines in about 3 days and you do not want to see the same things constantly.<br>- Art is really nice, especially the ones you can unlock in every storyline and can find back in the gallery<br>- Most characters are interesting and they all get some time in the spotlight and you learn interesting background stories for most of them<br>- The music is good, especially the battle music. I did not like all of it at first but it grows on you. <br><br>Cons<br><br>Not many cons, and most of them are probably personal but here goes.<br>- I did not like the fact that after all endings there were still questions unanswered, however possibly some people do not mind this.<br>- Bonus or true ending would have been nice, of course not game breaking or a real criticism, just would have been cool<br>- I cannot think of any real criticism I just really liked it<br><br>Just note that the game has no gameplay besides the choices, so if you do not like that than this is not the game for you.<br>If you love visual novels, you will love this!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19029907', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19029907' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19029907\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19029907' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19029907\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19029907', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19029907_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19029907_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18117861\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198242337366\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"282071638\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/34\/349b4de39208d89c68748b7949091e75d029d690.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/34\/349b4de39208d89c68748b7949091e75d029d690.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/34\/349b4de39208d89c68748b7949091e75d029d690_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198242337366\/\" data-miniprofile=\"282071638\">SamO<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198242337366\/games\/?tab=all\">56 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198242337366\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198242337366\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMadeleine Valois acts as a protector and companion of a young prince.

Many times, this leads players to feel disappointed and betrayed. However, there are also occasions in which we are lucky enough to stumble upon a fortunate surprise, in which the game's marketing just doesn't live up to the actual thing. <br><br>This is the case with The Royal Trap. Although the preview emphasises the otome side of the game, that is but a mere aspect of it. The main point in this game is not wooing hot guys, but guiding the protag, Madeleine, through a series of unexpected events and unveiling the mystery behind shady monarchs with ulterior motives. Although all 5 routes end up in some sort of relationship, they are so diverse that only 2 can be seen as your standard otome stuff, and even those lack the cringeworthy\/fanservicey moments most dating sims offer--probably because, instead of seeing the game as a cash cow, the devs actually care about their story and characters. The enticing plot and interesting structure becomes even more entertaining when added to a captivating cast and a protagonist who is strong and well-rounded, not just some empty ghost for players to project themselves onto (she reminds me of Quinrose protags). <br><br>The cast is also diverse for LGBT folks out there looking for representation: <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>you get 2 endings with female characters, out of which one is expressly romantic, and Cassidy is canonically an intersex trans girl. Also, one may be seen as an aro ending.<\/span><\/span><br><br>On the playability side, the game offers plenty of choices and most are quite intuitive, making it easy for the player to figure out what to do and how to reach most endings on their own. On the downside, there is no history button and the art tends to be inconsistent. It is obvious that the sprites and CGs were not drawn by the same person, but while the CGs are coherent (and beautiful!), the sprites are a mess. Some look good and detailed, some look like rushed, colored sketches. This may get in the way if you pay as much attention to the visuals as to any other aspect in the novel.<br><br>In the end, despite having its shortfalls, The Royal Trap is a very good game overall, and while it is a VN, I would not call it an otome game. It goes much beyond that and offers a diverse range of characters, relationships and endings (that don't always involve romance!). Definitely recommend it for those who enjoy a good story with well-rounded characters.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29852518', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29852518' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29852518\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29852518' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29852518\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29852518', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29852518_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29852518_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15890510\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Errapel\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"92860383\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/303b7a5e85067f29dfbb5804183e136f684e688f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/303b7a5e85067f29dfbb5804183e136f684e688f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/303b7a5e85067f29dfbb5804183e136f684e688f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Errapel\/\" data-miniprofile=\"92860383\">Errapel<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Errapel\/games\/?tab=all\">627 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Errapel\/recommended\/\">14 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Errapel\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">45.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love this game. The story is compelling, and the characters interesting. One issue that is often present with these types of games is that the female protagonist comes across as clueless or hopelessly naive, even outright daft. They often come across as a hollow shell, with now real life or motivation beyond that which the player ascribes to them. Happily this is not the case with 'Royal Trap'. Maddie is interesting and compelling, she is also competent and engaging. While there are occasions where she requires assistance or co-operation from others, this still remains on her terms, and she never falls into the 'damsel in distress' trope. <br><br>The game has great replayability since you only get the WHOLE story by playing the different routes. Each route (after the initial set up) is quite different, rather than a slight change in dialogue choices. <br><br>My only complaint is that my favourite route is not unlocked until your second playthrough. I didn't realise this and wound up with the bad ending, because the options I needed to take to avoid it, weren't available. So lesson learned: Save pursuing Callum till a later play through. <br><br>All in all I loved the game and heartily recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15890510', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15890510' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15890510\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15890510' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15890510\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15890510', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15890510_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15890510_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17341564\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shewolfoffrance\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"178057107\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/3630cad8ded87fb2b4c7c8a3719611311b338f5a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/3630cad8ded87fb2b4c7c8a3719611311b338f5a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/3630cad8ded87fb2b4c7c8a3719611311b338f5a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shewolfoffrance\/\" data-miniprofile=\"178057107\">SheWolfOfFrance<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shewolfoffrance\/games\/?tab=all\">17 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shewolfoffrance\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shewolfoffrance\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 1, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI liked this game A LOT. Intuitive, intriguing, humorous, realitively well written... You should note that even though this is a &quot;choose your oen adventure&quot; its still a visual novel...with a heavy emphasis on the novel aspect. Its a lot of reading, and not a ton of choice making (especially in the first half). All the same, its quite enjoyable. Although there are (I think?) 15 different endings\/tracks, there are only four that are REALLY different-- the others are variations of the four; however, with every track you take you get a bit more of the story, so you do have to complete pretty much all the ending for the the full circle of the plot. The characters are charming and unique to themselves, and each route is pleasing in a different way (Gaston's was my favorite-- very odd and humorous.). The main character is well-rounded and intellgent---something that I like to see in a female protagonist. <br><br>The replay-ablity is pretty good. The first and the third chapter (which are story heavy) are pretty much the same no matter the track, so they can be a bit tedious to get through, but the other 8 (or so?) will be different. The soundtrack is lovely; the art is strong in someplaces, and just sorta ok in others. This is also definitely not a dating sim, as many visual novels are. Several of the endings have a romance attached to them, but its harldly the focal point of the game. <br><br>My first playthrough took me about 2.5 hours. I'm sure you could go faster if you are more focused than I was (I was on a train with many distractions.) <br><br>I paid full price for the game, I do not regret that. I would do it again. <br><br>For people wondering if this is like Long Live the Queen: No. Its not strategy based for one thing. The emphasis on this is story, not survival (with a bit of story mixed in). However, the quality I would say is the same. Just know that it doesn't require near as much brain power.<br><br>P.S: Just for furter review validity, I want to mention that I have about 3 more hours of play time on this game that listed above. Dunno why it disappeared (maybe becasue I played it without being connected to the internet? I dunno.)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17341564', 'summary' );

I had some issues with the sprites themselves, there were times when they looked a bit disproportional but nothing major. The CG's in themselves are pretty good though.<br><b> Music: <\/b><br>I really liked the music (actually went to look for it on Spotify xD) but it eventually got a little bit repetitive in the game.<br><br><b> The story: <\/b><br>The story is pretty simple. The writing is decent and I ended up getting curious on how things would turn out and what the truth really was.<br><b> The Characters: <\/b><br>They are pretty good. You can identify each character easily, they each have their own personality and quirks and are enjoyable to interact with. Furthermore, with all the mystery involved you actually feel like you want to know each character's backstories and plans.<br><b> The Endings: <\/b><br>They are overall satisfying and they close up the paths well.<br><br><b> Cons: <\/b><br>The dialog\/story boxes... I have to say that it annoyed me plenty. During the characters' interactions the dialog box is placed in the bottom like by visual novel &quot;rule&quot;, but when we get the protagonist's inner monologue or narration, the box occupies the whole left side and it's just.... so... much.... text.... Don't get me wrong! I love to read, but when I come into a visual novel I'm expecting something a little bit different than a full page of text. It gets tiring after a while.<br><br>All in all, this game is enjoyable and sometimes even funny and intriguing. I've done two full playthroughs and I enjoyed both of them and actually found myself interested in getting all the endings.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30337387', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30337387' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30337387\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30337387' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30337387\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30337387', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30337387_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30337387_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30047115\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/diazflac\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"49720524\">diazflac<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a great branching visual novel, another winner from Hanako Games.<br><br>Presentation overall is quite excellent: writing, music, art, all well done and interesting. The characters are all pretty enjoyable and the theme of mystery and political intrigue, suspense, and all the surprises along the way really make for a great  little tale.<br><br>One of the common problems with many visual novels that try to have a lot of different routes\/endings is that the dialog can often overlap in places where it is used regardless of route, and sometimes it won't fit in well with the recent events of a particular route. The worst instances of this will even be immersion breaking and contradict things that have just transpired in one route but not another. The Royal Trap for as many possible routes and branches as it contains has surprisingly little of this common problem, and for that should be commended.<br><br>There are plenty of possible romance routes, and even a couple of same-gender romance endings tucked away in here for the fans of yuri\/lesbian couples, which is always a welcome addition in my book, and generally just a nice thing to see being represented.<br><br>I think one of the things that this game does particularly well is meaningful choices and consequences. There are a lot of interwoven mysteries as the plot thickens, and it seems frequently throughout the tale you are faced with decisions that can change your favor with the various lords and ladies, allowing you to switch allegiances and change where your loyalties lie.<br><br>With all the variety of options and choices, it feels like in any given playthrough you really only see a small fraction of the game's content, and with each time you try a new approach, you can't help but wonder how much more of the game there is left to uncover in the other routes you haven't aimed for yet.<br><br>There are of course many shared scenes and events across different routes too, but there are also quite a few ones that are unique to the particular route you are taking as well, so it feels like a good balance and mix of both. It keeps you wanting to come back and try new routes to see more of the game, and somehow they managed to keep it all flowing smoothly between scenes and routes too. It's pretty remarkable.<br><br>Definitely recommend this one. There's a lot to like here for anyone who enjoys a bit of suspense and mystery or just a good solid visual novel.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30047115', 'recent_short' );

I replayed through the various paths multiple times, gaining more and more insight and love for these characters. It's really well put together, the characters are interesting and you will fall for them as you play. You learn more about the events of the game as you go through as different characters which fleshes everything out and gives it a lovely depth to the world. The art is pretty, I love the music, I completely love every single character in this game. The character you play as has a flexibility to her as your avatar where you have a say in her character without compromising it. I knew nothing going into this game beyond it being published by the same people as Magical Diary (which I loved) and I was surprised and enchanted by it I think even more than Magical Diary. So if you loved that, I think you probably will love this too!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28906945', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28906945' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28906945\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28906945' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28906945\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28906945', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28906945_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28906945_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28826749\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198105180048\/recommended\/356530\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"144914320\">paintsunlight<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally fun story line with lots of different interesting endings. I liked that there were a lot of different happy endings to choose from. One downside is that some of the endings are not easy to get to--I had to look them up, because some of the choices didn't make all that much sense. But that was only for some of them, others were easy to get to. The romances were fun. The plot line was cool. The main character is a boss and a woman. Highly recommend as a great visual novel.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28826749', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28826749' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28826749\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28826749' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28826749\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28826749', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28826749_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28826749_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/356530\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 120 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30915314","15286472","23053181","15218343","19029907","18117861","18607269","29852518","15890510","17341564"]}
