So since it delivers what it promises - another novel DLC - I will instead use the thumb up.<br><br>The story this time isn't as linear as before. It still values the simple branching, but instead of do or die decisions, it offers two endings. The story also implies that it plays out after the siege, but before the final victory. This could be around chapter 11.<br>It isn't a particular long story and though it seems to be longer than the first DLC with 8 CGs - the first two being fan service again by choice like before - it is not. This stems from the two endings you can achieve. It has once more three decision points and the same length.<br>The story itself has a lot of fighting scenes which aren't described in the best way, so while the last one had a lot of feelings and situations to describe, expect to be bored here. This isn't the expertise of Hellsing. Further the amount of extra stories has shrunk to three, although longer this time, but only one could be seen as canon. One is a loli fan service story, the other is just nonsense with the gods. Only Saki's story plays after the good ending and might therefore be canon. It also isn't overdramatized like the other two.<br>The story itself further suffers from translation errors, double words and some gender confusion when Kotetsu is suddenly &quot;her&quot;. <br><br>Overall I am not disappointed by the DLC, but if I had known beforehand and payed the full price for the main game - I did not so I gladly bought the DLCs - I would have reconsidered buying it. That being said, during a 50% offer and if you like Waka and Kotetsu or this kind of 'service' in general, you can't really go wrong.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17586780', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17586780' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17586780\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17586780' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17586780\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17586780', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17586780_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17586780_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["17586780"]}
