Part 1 consists of two pieces of content: the small Cragholdt area (and associated quest); and the White March region, with a whole host of quests. The release of the first expansion dovetails with the release of the big 2.0 patch, which brings in a lot of new features, most importantly the ability to select AI-behavior settings for each party member.<br><br>Confusing, ain't it? Well... on to the review proper:<br><br>First: Cragholdt. The Cragholdt quest feels a lot like a quest that wasn't ready to include in Pillars of Eternity and Launch, so they lumped it in with the expansion, and even then only half-finished it. The area is small with no secrets to speak of, and the quest exceptionally simple. There are multiple ways to resolve the quest, but none are interesting. It's underwhelming, is what I'm saying.<br><br>But the White March region? It's fantastic. It's like a miniature Icewind Dale campaign, and it manages to overcome a lot of the flaws with Pillars of Eternity's vanilla experience. For example: each area is more densely packed with secrets and ecnounters; the choose-your-own-adventure scenes are encountered much more frequently and have more depth; immersion-breaking backer NPCs are absent entirely, and in there place are many actual NPCs, with lots of dialog and tasks and sidequests. Of particular note are some of the new enemies, which boast much more interesting designs. Of particular note are the Ogres early on, who wield massive upended cannons in battle.<br><br>And, don't worry, the quality of the writing is just as good in The White March (Part 1) as it is in the vanilla game.<br><br>Some people have criticized the story of TWM(1) for being, well, uninspired. Unimaginative. Too expected. You know what I'm getting at. Personally? I don't mind. PoE vanilla pushes the fantasy genre envelope far enough for me, so I welcome the return to a more conventional D&amp;D-style fantasy romp. Like I said: it feels very much like an Icewind Dale game.<br><br>In addition to the new White March region (which contains multiple areas--that is, maps) the expansion also provides two new companions. Whether or not you'll like them depends largely on whether or not you liked the vanilla companions, as they feel very similar--which ultimately means less banter in the dialog and more exposition. The monk Zahua didn't interest me very much, but the other companion (who I won't spoil) rapidly became one of my favorites. And don't worry: the new companions are fully integrated into the vanilla game, so you can take them with you outside of the White March area and they'll still have plenty to say.<br><br>Finally, even though this is &quot;part 1,&quot; the story\/quests all wrap up nicely. I think this is &quot;part 1&quot; because the second expansion will simply add new maps\/areas to the White March region (which is a second &quot;world map&quot;, like how the &quot;world map&quot; in vanilla PoE is just the Dyrwood).<br><br>So, yeah. That's my take on the first expansion to Pillars of Eternity. While the siege of Cragholdt will probably end up being the least memorable part of the entire game, I found the White March areas (which are the bulk of the experience) to be immensely enjoyable. In terms of how much &quot;bang&quot; you'll get for your &quot;buck,&quot; it took me about 90 minutes to clear Cragholdt, and around 12 hours to clear the White March stuff.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17794342', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17794342' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17794342\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17794342' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17794342\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17794342', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17794342_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17794342_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t154 of 199 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17762349\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"109005975\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/29\/29ec70af1386b4a0791e64bed2f34f7d0a1b79b1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/\" data-miniprofile=\"109005975\">Nerd House<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/games\/?tab=all\">2,965 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/\">172 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerdhouse\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Pillars of Eternity - The White March Part I<\/div><b>Developer<\/b>: Obsidian Entertainment<br><b>Publisher<\/b>: Paradox Interactive<br><br><b>Note<\/b>: A key for this was provided by the developer\/publisher for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review. No other compensation was given.<br><br><b>Introduction<\/b><br>==========<br>Heavily inspired by Black Isle Studio's 2000 RPG <i>Icewind Dale<\/i>, Pillars of Eternity - The White March Part I is the first portion of the White March expansion for Pillars of Eternity. The White March is a snowy region in the northern reaches of Eora, which is a nice contrast to the areas explored in the base game. This part of the expansion offers a lot of new content, which I will go over in the section below. The White March Part I was also released alongside a patch that all owners of the game received, adding a nice handful of new features to the game - the largest of which is Party AI.<br><br>To access the new content, talk to your Steward in Caed Nua to receive 2 quests which take you to the new areas: The White March and Cr\u00e4gholdt Keep. The White March contains the main story and quests of this expansion, while Cr\u00e4gholdt Keep is a very high level area intended for end-game parties.<br><br><b>What It Adds<\/b><br>==========<br>The White March adds quite a bit of content, which includes 2 new companions, new skills for each class, an increased level cap (from 12 to 14), lots of new quests, new dungeons to explore, Soulbound Weapons, and more. If Part I adds this much, I can't wait to see what Part II adds.<br><br>Let's get the big part out of the way first. The 2 new companions added are The Devil of Caroc and Zahua. The Devil of Caroc is a Construct, a rogue-ish golem with the soul of a murderer residing within it. While she is a rather interesting character, her 'secret' is revealed to you from the get-go. I felt it would have been better to slowly reveal it as you talk to and journey with her. It certainly would have had more of an impact. The other new companion, Zahua, is a masochistic Monk specializing in dual-handed combat. His body is covered in self-inflicted scars, which he claims eliminates his vanity, which is forbidden by his religion. You find him in a barrel of stinking fish...A strange character to say the least, but nonetheless a competent fighter that is a welcome addition to your party, as he excels at punching people really, really hard.<br><br>The increased level cap of 14 adds a slew of new skills, abilities, and cross-class talents for all classes. Also added are Soulbound Weapons: special weapons for each class that bind to them upon equipping them. These weapons get a bit stronger over time the more you use them. There are at least 5 of these weapons, at least that I've found thus far, with more coming in The White March Part II. Also added is a plethora of new equipment, so you can finally deck out all of your characters head to toe.<br><br><b>Why You Should Buy It<\/b><br>==========<br>This part of the expansion adds so much content, but the majority of it is combat-oriented. With the addition of Party AI, this is a very welcome addition as it lets you test out the new AI options and settings. It definitely makes battles feel more streamlined and less drawn-out. Before battles were filled with constant pauses, as you issued orders individually to each of your party members multiple times per battle. No more of that!<br><br>The new companions are interesting and help to flesh out party composition, and can even be brought out of the White Macrh areas and into the base game locations. The soulbound weapons are powerful, but balanced. They are great pieces of equipment overall. You can access the expansion areas starting at level 10, but the vast majority of it cannot be completed unless you are at least level 12-13. Cr\u00e4gholdt Keep is definitely aimed for parties at levels 13-14, although 14 is definitely preferred.<br><br>All this being said, here are a few downsides:<br><br>-The obvious: the expansion was cut into parts. This is part 1. Part 2 will require a separate purchase in the future, unless you buy the Expansion Pass, which gives access to both parts.<br>-The new content is very difficult unless you are the new cap level or extremely efficent at managing your characters in the heat of battle.<br>-The content is integrated into the base game, but you cannot access it until a certain point in Act 2.<br>-If you save too far into the last dungeon of the base game (with no earlier backups), you cannot leave and access the new content unless you restart the entire game.<br>-The new quests are mostly unremarkable, with a few exceptions.<br><br><b>Final Thoughts<\/b><br>==========<br>An excellent add-on for Pillars of Eternity. I highly recommend it to all owners of the base game, I'd even go so far as to say it's a must-buy. Players who particularly enjoy the combat system and mechanics of Pillars of Eternity will get the most enjoyment out of The White March Part I. I am looking forward to Part 2 for sure!<br><br><b>Nerd House Verdict<\/b>:<br>==========<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Highly Recommended<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17762349', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17762349' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17762349\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17762349' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17762349\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17762349', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17762349_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17762349_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t77 of 100 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17717770\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48326471\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6dc845f41e99ccd8f4316e5c38bb90a79349c79.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6dc845f41e99ccd8f4316e5c38bb90a79349c79.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a6\/a6dc845f41e99ccd8f4316e5c38bb90a79349c79_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48326471\">Kitch<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/games\/?tab=all\">63 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008592199\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo keep it simple, if you liked Pillars of Eternity and are interested in the expansion you won't be disappointed.

So, not a glich, I just didn't know what it was at first.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17717770', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17717770' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17717770\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17717770' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17717770\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17717770', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17717770_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17717770_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17988863\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022369703\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"62103975\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/be\/be903fdaf01bb931701ef05e458318d5543f950f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/be\/be903fdaf01bb931701ef05e458318d5543f950f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/be\/be903fdaf01bb931701ef05e458318d5543f950f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022369703\/\" data-miniprofile=\"62103975\">..<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022369703\/games\/?tab=all\">345 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022369703\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022369703\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPretty good expansion.<br><br>Adds two new stories \/ zones.<br><br><b>First, the White Marches<\/b>, made for a party of around lvl 6-9+, which features 10 or so average-sized areas (and a few minor ones), a whole new storyline centered around opening a dwarven fort that has been sealed for some 200 years, with convenient use of your watcher powers of course. This part of the expansion feels a lot like the first part of the early parts of the base game; a lot of the dialogue is voice acted and pretty well written, it contains the two new companions, the areas you explore are dense in fairly interesting encounters, there's lots of really good loot to be had, and overall it just feels like a high-quality addition to the currently existing game.<br><br>The ending to that section of the game is a little annoying, though. Yeah, it doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se, but the episodic nature of the expansion is made very clear; the story isn't over yet, even if this chapter of it might be, and you're going to have to wait for part 2 to get the final conclusion. Still, it ends in a fairly satisfying way, so it didn't bother me too much... even if I would've liked to see people return to the fort at the end of this part instead of having to wait to the start of part 2 to see it. Felt a bit cheated there.<br><br><b>Second, Cr\u00e4gholdt Bluffs<\/b>, made for a party around lvl 12+. This section is just one average-sized outside area filled with people who want to kill you, and one average-sized inside area filled with more people who want to kill you. This part feels a lot more like Icewind Dale than Pillars of Eternity, though with an much shakier narrative justification for what you're doing. You basically just show up there for no reason other than because it's on your map, then everyone you meet immediately tries to kill you and so you just butcher your way through the place until you reach the guy in charge, at which point you kill him too. Yeah, you sometimes converse with them <i>before<\/i> you fight to the death (very similar to Icewind Dale there), but it always ends in a fight to the death. Well, that not entirely true; I think I encountered one character who didn't force me to kill them... but that was it (and killing them was still clearly an option).<br><br>It's a fun place to have your really powerful party still face some genuine challenges, but don't expect a very gripping narrative, and it'll be over pretty fast.<br><br><b>The two new potential party members<\/b> are of about the same quality as the existing ones, that is - better than BG1 quality, but much, much worse than PS:Torment quality. Their little personal quests are nice enough, but they'll be over very quickly.<br><br><b>The new soulbound weapons<\/b> we're offered are honestly disappointing. With only 5 to be found: 1 estoc (usable by all), 1 great sword (usable by paladin, fighter, barbarian), 1 hunting bow (usable by ranger, chanter, cipher), 1 quarterstaff (usable by druid, monk, wizard), and 1 1-handed mace (usable by rogue, priest), you may find yourself not even using most of them, especially since the triggers necessary to fill to make them actually good items are sometimes so annoying to accomplish that you probably can't realistically achieve them (such as having your wizard melee stuff to death to upgrade his staff; a difficult task unless your wiz was built for that sort of thing).<br><br>I hope they expand it in part 2 though, before the game sorely needs more interesting loot, and this loot <i>was<\/i> more interesting... there just wasn't enough of it.<br><br><b>The party AI<\/b> is a nice addition, making those per-encounter abilities that you might not have bothered to micromanage for every single encounter with every group of enemies still good in those situations, and by the very late game you may also have so many spells and abilities that for the less important battles you just let everyone use per-rest abilities freely while you occasionally micromanage your party. You'll really want to rest before fighting bigger threats anyway.<br><br>Its implementation isn't perfect, though. Their ability choices are usually less than ideal, and some abilities they simply won't use at all (I never saw anyone use spells that did friendly fire, for example, even though it would've been easy to land them safely). Characters will <i>still<\/i> sometimes stand around doing nothing in the middle of battle, even when set to aggressively attack anything in range. They'll also sometimes inexplicably decide to target enemies far away from the battle; I often spotted my paladin and rogue heading away from the battle, intent upon using some ability to take down an enemy elsewhere on the map. Not a big deal, since you easily spot them and turn them back around before they get very far, but worth noting.<br><br><b>The increased level cap<\/b> is cool, but also feels kind of weird. If you, like me, start a new game from scratch to enjoy the expansion, you will end up outleveling a lot of the game's content very fast if you start doing the expansion as soon as you can (lvls 6-9). I hit up the White Marches as soon as I could before going back to the rest of the game, and as a consequence achieved lvl 14 barely after the revolt broke out in Defiance Bay. It goes without saying that after clearing out Cr\u00e4gholdt, nothing else in the game from that point on posed any kind of challenge. Even the master below fell over to my not very min-maxed lvl 14 party in like 30 seconds.<br><br>You may want to get something like the <b>IE Mod<\/b>, and enable a nerfed exp table, if you want to keep the game challenging, otherwise you'll likely outlevel the content too fast.<br><br><b>Overall<\/b>, it's a pretty good expansion. Buy it if you like the base game and want more of the same, of a pretty high quality (much higher quality than the final act of the base game, in my opinion). The welcomed basic gameplay changes are given to everyone with the 2.0 patch anyway, so it's not like you'd need the expansion to enjoy those.<br><br>Don't regret my purchase; looking forward to part 2.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17988863', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17988863' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17988863\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17988863' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17988863\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17988863', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17988863_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17988863_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23404389\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197980429671\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"20163943\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c22b947ac1d9c02ad444c0a113f66b1bc224a425.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c22b947ac1d9c02ad444c0a113f66b1bc224a425.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c2\/c22b947ac1d9c02ad444c0a113f66b1bc224a425_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197980429671\/\" data-miniprofile=\"20163943\">Bubba Jones<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197980429671\/games\/?tab=all\">165 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197980429671\/recommended\/\">67 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197980429671\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first expansion to Pillars of Eternity:  Adds new item types, dungeons, loot, story, abilities, a higher level cap, and three companions to the early-mid game.  If you've been playing and enjoying Pillars of Eternity, you will find much to like about its expansion and have no reason not to grab it.  The expanded area takes place some time in Chapter 2 and is balanced for that point in the game.  You are encouraged to go there as soon as possible to start getting the new loot and have more exploration room in the game.<br><br>The story can be surmised thusly: A fishing village in the White March wants to break into an ancient dwarven hold to uncover the secret of forging their steel to become prosperous.  They search for adventurers to do the job for them and you are one of the adventurers they contact.  In the process of helping them, you learn more of the White March and the disaster that befell it ages ago and find a lot of nice loot.<br><br>The expansion adds a lot of content to the game, new quests, three new overworld areas with caves and smaller dungeons, a village to visit as a hub area for the White March, and a very large and intricately detailed dungeon to finish off the content.  Each area is large for this game and filled with encounters, NPCs and quests to add to the base game.<br><br>Each class gets some new abilities to play with to further the variaty of builds you can make with each class:  there is no reason to worry too much about losing out since respecs cost a little money which you will get plenty of here.  The only set of new abilities I didn't like too much were the cross-class abilities.  I found them a little underwhelming compared to what was already available in each class.<br><br>The respec deserves a new mention, this is useful throughout the entire game and will allow you to play with, change, and adjust your character's stats to suit your needs.  You can even spec your builds to fight a type of enemy.  The only cost is a token amount of gold which you will find a LOT of over the course of the game.<br><br>The new loot comes in two varieties:  New named weapons\/armor\/accessories and Soulbound items.  A lot of the new accessories filled gaps I felt were obvious in the game until now: Gloves improving unarmed damage for monks, etc, etc.  The weapons and armor are less impressive but they sport new abilities you haven't seen or used on enchantable items.  The last category of items you'll see are soulbound items and are the real reason you want to come here as soon as you can.  You first bind them to a character with a class the weapon likes then the items level up as that character finishes tasks with them.  By the time they have their final abilities unlocked, they are some of the most powerful items in the game.<br><br>There are two extra companions, each of them give you more dialogue, story, and more interesting banter and interaction with the environment.  More importantly, they fill two of the slots of the missing three characters you may not have already: a monk, and a rogue.<br><br>In all this is a large package which expands the content in the game, and expands the gameplay in the base game.  It is something you should certainly grab if you have been enjoying Pillars of Eternity.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23404389', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23404389' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23404389\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23404389' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23404389\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23404389', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23404389_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23404389_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t102 of 168 people (61%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17712499\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/teln3t\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"12742947\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/492a10298e307a9e72cff7e544bca4631f642f78.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/492a10298e307a9e72cff7e544bca4631f642f78.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/492a10298e307a9e72cff7e544bca4631f642f78_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/teln3t\/\" data-miniprofile=\"12742947\">Ruka Urushibara<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/teln3t\/games\/?tab=all\">148 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/teln3t\/recommended\/\">14 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/teln3t\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Story.

But after playing a bit into it, I have to say I feel that a lot of the negative comments towards it are misplaced.<br><br>There's a whole new region to explore, a fresh snowy landscape that, to me, is a very exciting and change of pace from the Dyrwood.  The maps are loaded with a lot more secrets, encounters, and loot that was available in the vanilla campaign maps, the characters are mostly all voice acted and the quests seem a lot more fun.<br><br>Maybe it's a bit simple compared to the main campaign, but I really like it.  The simplicity is nice.  Go on a quest to find the White Forge, look for legendary weapons, do it because you're an adventurer and you like killing things.  And there's plenty of things to kill.<br><br>That said, I bought this just in time for my party as I was around level 9 and so I can't complain about the fact that it's not an end-game DLC.  You have to have a save file from before you beat the game to be able to partake in the quest, and from what I've read, if you're higher than the recommended level to do The White March, it will prompt you with a choice to scale up the monsters to your level.<br><br>Is it worth the price?  Well, cheaper is certainly better.  I got a good deal on this and the upcoming Part 2 in a bundle, as I don't think the DLC should be worth half the price of the game.

Together though they make a really, really nice addition to an already wonderful game. More cool, gorgeous, scary places to explore, more good writing and so much more. If you loved PIllars of Eternity and want more, pick both of these two expansion packs up. Part 1 is more of a introduction so to speak, and part 2 really gets things going at a wonderful level.<br><br>Keep up the good work Obsidian, another good expansion pack to add to the resume (Loved Mask of The Betrayer Expansion campaign for NWN2 and loved Fallout New Vegas's Expansion called Old World Blues). I would rate Part 1 a 7.5\/10 and part two I would giv ea 9 or 9.5 as far as dlc or expansions go.<br><br>In the end these two expansion packs could be called &quot;The Icewind Dale Of The Pillars of Eternity&quot; :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21396624', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21396624' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21396624\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21396624' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21396624\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21396624', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21396624_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21396624_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19242504\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"77586870\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0f\/0fc9cddab0981687d97d46573cd6784dd827195c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0f\/0fc9cddab0981687d97d46573cd6784dd827195c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0f\/0fc9cddab0981687d97d46573cd6784dd827195c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/\" data-miniprofile=\"77586870\">Sturmkr\u00e4he<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/games\/?tab=all\">121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sturmkrahe12\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a kickstart backer of the PoE, I would recommend to get the DLC to any fans of the game in a heartbeat without thinking. Not only it adds 2 more very interesting companions, it's a very nice homage to the Icewind Dale. The snowy atmosphere of the White March is just perfect and it draws you in very quickly. The side quests are decent but the real gem is the main quest of the DLC. It is very interesting and it ties very smoothly to the game's original main quest. Lot of moments in the DLC you really feel like a Watcher and I must say it is much better than many Watcher moments in the vanilla game. Also the special interactions are all feel really quality and fun to do in the DLC, they are nicely tailored.<br><br>The story is awesome, the quests are good, new monsters and loot are good, there are a lot of hack and slash like IWD style and it is FUN. If you already love the game and have a special place in your heart for the old Icewind Dale, you will feel at home. Get your choice of hot beverage and dive into the White March!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19242504', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19242504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19242504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19242504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19242504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19242504', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19242504_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19242504_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30914292\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oildr\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"34377877\">im\u00e3 de autista<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe encounters have been stepped up in this DLC and require even more tactical planning to succeed. A real step up and since the 3.0 update this game is a masterpiece of design, depth, and accessibility.<br><br>You'll see a small handful of bad reviews, these are from a few die hards who preferred the cheesable builds of Baldur's Gate, who preferred reloading because the web trap wasn't detected, reload because their fighter got nuked by a spell, pre-buff, pre-buff, pre-buff, and oh, you can rest as much as you like, which means resting all the time. These people are wrong, Baldur's Gate series was great, but Pillars is so much better, there is no contest.<br><br>If you have any inclination towards this kind of CRPG then buy it and the expansion content, you will not regret it. It is 100% worth full price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30914292', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30914292' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30914292\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30914292' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30914292\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30914292', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30914292_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30914292_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30765775\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198125513366\/recommended\/373340\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"165247638\">Armanz<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou like Pillars of Eternity and want to buy the two DLCs but aren't convinced yet? Let me ask you a question: Do you like hammers, freezing your \u2665\u2665\u2665 off and getting high off glowing giant mushrooms? Then The White March is for you! You don't? What kind of person are you? You disgust me!<br><br>Long version (if you love Pillars of Eternity skip this and read my short version):<br><br>For the record, I'm reviewing both DLCs.<br>Liked it very much.<br>Nice tactical encounters, liked the story, the visuals are very nicely done, some of the NPCs you meet really have a nice touch to them and theres numerous small details that are funny and\/or interesting. What I really liked is that it's not post-game but during the main game and offers some Open World experience. Many players complained about the basic game basically steering you into one direction. I found it very refreshing to switch between the main story, the Endless Paths and the DLC. The game features interestingly sounding new companions (which I didn't pick though because I have to have my team up as fast as possible and never take late companions). One of the 3 companions only has a quest through the second DLC though, as far as I understood. The DLCs aso add some nice new gear which is fairly balanced. You also get access to a couple Soulbound items (like the Caed Nua Rod from the main game) and Sort of a Spoiler! an additional type of Enchant system which adds Enchantments on top of your regular enchantments, which is very neat. The DLCs also add a nice difficulty spike. I have to admit at being pretty bad at the game in general, but there's a nice curve in the DLCs and they add a good deal of boss battles and even &quot;regular&quot; battles that feel like bosses.<br><br>Playtime: My first time playing the main game I took 36 hours to finish it and I did basically every quest including all the companions quests. Now I played it for the second time with both DLCs and again did basically every quest there was, playtime was about 82 hours this time. So those are big \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing DLCs, man.<br><br>Now to the cons, there aren't many. I found it a bit less story driven than the maingame, but from my Isometric RPG experience, the Add Ons always are like that (looking at you Throne of Bhaal and Heart of Winter). I bought both DLCs on a sale because I was a bit annoyed by the price of 15 bucks per DLC. Compared to the maingame they do add a great deal of playing time though so looking back I gladly would've spent those 30 bucks since they're well worth their money.<br><br>Short version: Buy it, it's good bro.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30765775', 'recent_short' );

There are some nice additions to the basic systems such as party AI, improved stealth and soulbound items which slowly unlock new abilities.  Due to that everyone should really pick this up.<br><br>I found the main story arch to be pretty good.  There were some nice additions to the enemy list but they could have used some more exciting stuff here.  I don't want to spoil anything so I won't get specific.  I am just quite tired of spirits and we have a large section of the content fighting them again.  And other new enemies fight like the base classes so really don't feel very exciting.  The beginning in Stalwart was quite fun though.<br><br>The main reason this is a mild recommendation is due to the final area and the high level optional content.  It is just hard and not very fun.  Especially the optional stuff.  I should say I am playing on hard \/ expert and had a max leveled party.  When your party is a high level you are asked if you would like to scale the content up to your level.  I am guessing the difficulty may stem more from the scaling than anything but I can't be sure.  Also the enemy AI was changed up some and they now love to chase your squishy mages and rogues.  When these guys have abilities to stun and teleport around the battlefield it made so that I stopped using Aloth altogether.  I was spending most of my time trying to keep him alive.  I love his spells but ended up dumping him which was sad.  This is really only a problem for the really tough battles and may not apply to normal difficulty at all.<br><br>Still worthwhile but wasn't as fun as I had hoped.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28552425', 'recent_short' );

With the release of PoE\u2018s first expansion, The White March Part 1, I was given plenty of incentive to return to the world of Eora.  Developer Obsidian Entertainment said all the right things; new dungeons, gear, weapons, abilities, companions, cross-class talents and an increased level cap. The reason Obsidian chose to release The White March in sections was their desire to get new content into the hands of players sooner rather than later. An admirable and understandable decision. But was it the right one?<br><br>The White March Part 1 expands upon the third act of Pillars of Eternity and requires an experienced, well equipped party to complete. If you are returning to PoE for the expansion you\u2019ll want to choose a save that is as close to the end of the game as possible. The savegame I chose was from before I fought the final boss (just before the point-of-no-return). If the game detects you do indeed have a high level party it will offer you the option of  increasing the difficulty of The White March Part 1 content to provide more of a challenge for you party. The rewards you receive remain the same regardless of whether you choose High Level or Standard difficulty. As the savegame I chose was already on Normal difficulty, I chose the High Level difficulty option.<br><br>The main story of The White March Part 1 revolves around the village of Stalwart and their desire to reopen Durgan\u2019s Battery; an ancient Dwarven stronghold. At one time Durgan\u2019s Battery created the best weapons and armor in the land; right up until they sealed their doors and never opened them again. The villagers want someone to reopen Durgan\u2019s Battery to help save their struggling community. Vanilla PoE was reasonably good about adding twists to old school fantasy cliches. The White March Part 1 unfortunately is not. The story of Durgan\u2019s Battery feels like it could have been pulled in its entirety from any pop culture fantasy novel. Now that may change when The White March Part 2 launches, as the first part of the tale of Durgan\u2019s Battery\/The White March ends with a number of unanswered questions and the promise of an even bigger threat. It\u2019s hard to judge a story when you have only heard half of it.<br><br>This unsatisfying division extends to just about everything. The expansion introduces two new companions you can add to your party; Zahua (Monk), and the Devil of Caroc (Rogue). The pair are a bit of a let down. Zahua is a crazy monk who loves getting high, wallowing in filth and harming himself in the pursuit of \u201cclarity.\u201d The Devil of Caroc is an artificial construct imbued with a human soul. She has a pretty dark backstory and nasty sense of humor. Unfortunately their descriptions are a lot more interesting than the characters themselves are when you have them in your party. Neither of them have very much to say or contribute. A couple quick quests and a couple conversations and that is it. Zahua ends up feeling like a lame stoner version of Durance the Priest (who is also a crazy man).<br><br>The Devil of Caroc \u201ccould\u201d have been something special. Instead she is just a superfluous rogue you\u2019ll quickly want to swap out. In fact I found purposely keeping the pair in the party while I completed The White March Part 1 content to be more of a hindrance than anything else. You\u2019re not missing that much not taking them along. You probably already have a go to rogue for your party so the need for The Devil of Caroc is super low. Even with her increased damage resistance and abilities she\u2019s not a compelling choice for your party. Zahua is even less useful. Despite trying dozens of builds and permutations, for the life of me I can\u2019t find a situation in which I\u2019d rather have a Monk than one of the other classes. So in the end both new companions have little to add to the story or the combat. Which again could change when The White March Part 2 expands upon things, but judging this expansion on its merits alone both are a disappointment.<br><br>As players will quickly discover, combat is king in The White March Part 1. Besides Durgan\u2019s Battery itself there are a number of side quests and dungeons. The Cragholdt Bluffs was specifically designed to give well geared end-game parties a tough challenge. You\u2019ll battle a number of mini bosses before an epic throw down at the end. The expansion also adds a new Dragon to hunt down, as well as number of tough bounties to complete. The side quest involving a group of smarter-than-average-ogres was one of my favorites. Here at least White March Part 1 shines. The combat is challenging and satisfying.<br><br>Alongside new dungeons, the expansion adds new gear, weapons, abilities, cross-class talents and an increased level cap. I really, really liked the addition of cross-class talents. It allows for some really fun, and more importantly, really powerful character builds. The new abilities added to the game are pretty great as well. The value of the new weapons and armor depends on whether or not your chosen party can make use of them. One of the big selling points for The White March was the addition of soulbound weapons, which increase in strength the more you use them. They become really powerful and are worth respec\u2019ing your party to accommodate them. My main gripe with the soulbound weapons is that there are only 5 (?) of them. A weird number for a game with parties of six. Plus the weapon types are not exactly the kind I would choose to equip under normal circumstances. A Mace, Hunting Bow, Quarterstaff, Great Sword and Estoc are hardly my go to weapons. Because only certain classes can equip certain soulbound weapons (with different benefits depending on which class you bind them to) you\u2019ll find yourself with an odd ball party if you want to field a party with all five soulbound weapons equipped.<br><br>I already had a character built around wielding a great sword, and a quality bow is always welcome. I never use quarterstaff\u2019s, maces or estocs (another kind of two handed sword). So if you want to field a party with all five soulbound weapons you now have a pair of two handed sword wielders (less than ideal), probably a caster or a monk with a Quarterstaff (again less than ideal) and a rogue or a priest with a mace (even less ideal). The sheer power of the soulbound weapons eventually counteracts the negatives of having a weirdly built party, but it takes a lot of the freedom of choice away from the player and forces you to play a certain way, which really jars when compared to vanilla PoE. Adding more soulbound weapons would help immensely.<br><br>Ultimately The White March Part 1 feels exactly like what it is; half an expansion. Story, characters, improvements and more feel \u201calmost done.\u201d I constantly had the feeling that if I just had a little more time with things everything would \u201cclick.\u201d Critical as I have been of the expansion I did have fun. I pulled almost 20 hours of entertainment out of a $17 expansion. Even though I have gripes about a lot of stuff, there is enough content and enough entertainment to be found to justify paying its current asking price. Broader improvements like cross-class talents, level cap increase, soulbound weapons etc. make a fresh playthrough of the entire game more appealing. I strongly suspect that once The White March Part 2 drops the entire expansion \u201cpackage\u201d will be a lot more compelling. As much as it was nice to have some more PoE content to play I think I would have preferred Obsidian had released the entire package together rather than cut into segments.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26531147', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26531147' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26531147\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26531147' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26531147\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26531147', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26531147_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26531147_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["17794342","17762349","17717770","17988863","23404389","17712499","18241653","20554068","21396624","19242504"]}
