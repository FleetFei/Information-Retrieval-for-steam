Now let\u2019s begin!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">MULTIPLAYER <\/div><br>This is a totally different experience from the Singleplayer. Where you will be able to do almost anything you like. Just around the corner there\u2019s  huge \u2665\u2665\u2665 armory  with all kinds of weapons and tools, that provide you hell a lot of possibilities to crush your enemies, such as invisibility cloaks, machineguns, deathly  spells, rockets, vehicles, magical bows and turrets. <br><br>Every kind of damage and tactic has a counter, there\u2019s no instant damage and nothing that you cannot evade, from rockets to sniper guns there\u2019s a shield to block them, for the giant beast's claws and speed, there\u2019s a jetpack upgrade that boosts you into the air to evade any threat, which combined with the power of other explosives expansive waves, such as mines and rockets, they can boost you even further at the pure style of quake! AND THERE'S A LOT MORE!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> **THE MECCARYNS** <\/b><\/div><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544142<\/a><br><br>Take the appearance some sort of British space soldier with his martini, some rocket launchers and a basic jetpack to aid him in battle. One of the weakest races that relies on their technology to survive all the challenges. These fellas can fight each other in an MvM death match or battle against the giant monster on MvK mode. <br><br>The most common build for Meccs in mvm it\u2019s a bunch of rocket launchers, a shield and explosives. Sounds like they will only be flying around and pew pew \u2018in everything, but it is far more fun and trickier than that. The gameplay of this guys consists in being on offensive, defensive and being able manage your resources at the same time (as you probably saw on the video I posted before). <br><br>The MvK mode where you fight the beast it\u2019s totally different.<br><br>You will need your aerial vehicles to kill the beast, along with machineguns and mortars. There\u2019s a lot you can do here, many possibilities to die or kill in hilarious ways. The thing that helps the most here its jumping like a flea with the propulsion of a rocket and a mine's expansive wave.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> **THE SEA REAPERS**<\/b><\/div><br>Oh the reapers, THE GOD DAMN REAPERS. You take the appearance of some sort of exotic female creature, like an avatar but this one has lightning fast attacks from sword and bow to extraordinary huge spells. Like the &quot;clock&quot; that slows the time to whatever it gets in (even bullets and Kabuto).<br><br>So, as the Meccs these sea reapers have a lot of weapons, but instead of tools and jetpacks, they have spells and a turbo mode which allows them to fly from hill to hill, bombarding everything in the floor with explosives and spells.<br><br>They feature mostly in 3way battles and RVK.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544141\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544141<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> **KABUTO**<\/b><\/div><br>My favorite character. It\u2019s a lot of fun killing 5 guys at once in a single slam. Well, this 100 feet tall\/unknown gender beast can perform wrestling-like attacks to slam its enemies that either die crushed against its 900 tons or being ripped down to pieces by the expansive wave caused by the collision with the ground. The millenary scrolls tell us that \u201cWhen big Kabuto \u2665\u2665\u2665 drop from sky, run like your nuts are on fire\u201d, so just take your mines and jetpack and fly far as you can! (Ye you can kill things with your butt cheeks)<br><br>Anyways, this also has its mechanics, not only just walking and stomping things. You can use the Full power of the adrenaline attack that will catapult you into the air, allowing you to destroy all the things out of your reach, like helicopters.  And a lot of other things that you need to try for yourself. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=812544116<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> Conclusion <\/b> <\/div>-One of the best games ever made, ahead of its time and  a master piece in game programming, even spending time finding its bugs (in multiplayer) is fun to do. It has some good physics on it and a sense of scale, especially when fighting Kabuto.  That gives that feel of stress, knowing that you are fighting an overwhelming enemy.  <br><br>-Its mechanics are flawless, use your tools, weapons and the environment as your favor. Dodge missiles by jumping like a flea, grenade jump to a hill then rocket jump back, aim your missile trajectory to the enemy\u2019s trajectory, or fight Kabuto in slow mo while being inside a slowing time spell. And there\u2019s lots of other combinations that will probably end up as spontaneous moments of epicness!<br><br>-No unlockable things, everything at your hands!<br><br>-Its graphics are amazing for that generation of games, just take a look for games that were made in 1999-2000, it was like the VR of that era. Anyways, you can find skins and HD models on <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/giantswd.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >giantswd.org<\/a>, just take a look, it\u2019s not a fishy website!<br><br>-Its only 10 bucks.<br><br>I give a <b>10\/10<\/b> on this multiplayer, one of the most underrated in gaming history and the best ive ever played. This game deserves a remake.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28469619', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28469619' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28469619\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28469619' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28469619\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28469619', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28469619_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28469619_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28172667\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198185116051\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"224850323\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e688a909f61410a4cbd5d18d566913eb35edde2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e688a909f61410a4cbd5d18d566913eb35edde2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e688a909f61410a4cbd5d18d566913eb35edde2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198185116051\/\" data-miniprofile=\"224850323\">Downward Thrust<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198185116051\/games\/?tab=all\">38 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198185116051\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198185116051\/recommended\/557750\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t <div class=\"bb_h1\">Giants: Citizen Kabuto Review<\/div>Below is a video review for the new version, as well as a written version below.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6UaQmVf-4A8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_3\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6UaQmVf-4A8<\/a><br>Giants: Citizen Kabuto is a very odd story.  16 years ago, this now legendary game was born and developed by Planet Moon and published by Interplay.  Although it didn\u2019t sell well initially, critic reviews were incredibly high and over time Giants garnered a fiercely cult following.  I was one of them, and this was my generation.  And now it\u2019s available on Steam for PC players. <br><br>It was a game ahead of its time, both in its ideas and in its gameplay.  In it\u2019s most basic form, Giants is a third-person shooter with real-time strategy elements folded in.  <br><br><b>Background and History<\/b><br>Three very distinct species occupy the Island: The Kabuto, the Sea Reapers, and our trusty friends the Meccs. Searching the planets for their missing friends, the Meccs, as you probably guessed, landed onto the island as space castaways.  But like all intruders, their presence is very much unwelcome to the native Kabuto and Reapers and the tenuous fighting between them.  <br><br>The story of Giants is a fusion of these three separate race stories combined into a single storyline, and spend several missions with each race as the story unfolds.  The game begins with the player taking control of the Meccs as they try to reassemble their scattered group after their unscheduled stop on the Island.  You are treated some hilarious dialogue and a cutscene that would look good next to any Michael bay movie.  <br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>Giants blends the shooter genre with the real time strategy genre, and then adds base building on top of it - an ambitious mash-up for a 16 year old idea.<br><br>When you first step out of your aircraft you\u2019ll see the Island for yourself and the stage is composed d of 24 lush, beautiful islands. Friendly and not so friendly indigenous life roam the land under the rule of the evil queen Sappho, her evil magic-wielding Reapers and their guards.  Wild-life is out to get you too.  Danger is always present, yet it sits right next to such beauty.  The waters glisten, the sun radiates with light and the tree branches sway in the wind.  But there is ni-time for drooling over the beauty - it\u2019s time to find your friends and get off this island!<br><br>You begin the game as Baz, laser gun in hand and British cheeky humor in the other.  <br>These guys shoot machine guns, throw grenades, plant bombs and use jetpacks to for limited flight. They're also an organized lot - you can command your fellow Meccs to defend, attack and retrieve, making them formidable and fun to play.  <br><br>You\u2019ll spend several missions and hours playing as Baz, growing your mecc army, building bases and commanding your buddies to do your bidding.  You can capture native creatures called Smarties to bring home to your base and do your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 work as long as you continue to feed them vemp meat, collected on the island from you guessed it...vimps.  If you fail to collect proper amounts of this delicious meat, the little smartie \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s will protest and refuse to work for you.   But if you\u2019re good to your little slaves, eventually you\u2019ll be able to build a party house - yeah i\u2019m not kidding it\u2019s literally called a party house - that will permanently feed your smarties and give you a host of kick-\u2665\u2665\u2665 deployable weapons and defenses.<br><br>Once you complete the section of the campaign devoted to the Meccs, you\u2019ll move on to what a lot of people consider the most enjoyable section of the game: the reapers.<br><br>You\u2019ll be playing as Delphi, who was genetically created by Queen Sappho to be the purest form of Sea Reaper.  She\u2019s a deadly, damn near naked avatar look-alike who can travel at insane speeds and use special abilities to absolutely wreck enemies.  But you\u2019ll still be needing to build bases as Delphi, which is why the Meccs and the Repears are at odds with each other - they are competing over the smarties.  <br><br>It\u2019s under a similar umbrella as Aliens vs Predator and Evolve - games where power differences can be equalized by tipping the scales of how many players occupy each team.  Do people like this, or was it the reason that Giants never took off?  <br><br><b>Graphics And Fidelity<\/b><br>It\u2019s 2016, and this game still looks great.  That\u2019s saying a lot for a 16 year old game.  It\u2019s all in the little details, the unbelievably atmospheric music, the faint sounds of the strange dinosaur-looking birds that gently fly over head, and the whispering sounds of the water hitting the sand.  But it\u2019s more than the sound.  It\u2019s also the tiny slide animation when you go down a hill - completely unnecessary but such a welcome touch, fully featured destruction and the cutscenes that just drip with humor, polish and a real since of cinema.  Such forward thinking went in to the camera angles and the cinematography - cutscenes just feel like an immersive movie - exactly how they should.<br><br><b>Cons and Opportunities<\/b><br>Unfortunately, bugs reer their ugly head in Giants.  The game has not been re-done, this is not a remake or an HD upgrade, this is the game as is 16 years ago.  And with it comes the bugs and the absolutely god awful optimization.  It took me hours of adjusting my Nvidia settings to get a constant framerate in this game, and that\u2019s just not acceptable in 2016.  <br><br>Secondly, the elephant in the room.  Where is the quick save feature - it was missing 16 years ago and it\u2019s still missing today?  Some of the missions in Giants can take over an hour, and if you don\u2019t properly strategist from the start and manage your NPC companions, you could easily have to replay many of the games\u2019 missions.  The idea behind Giants is a gentle mission progression, and that is negatively affected if players have to continually re-start missions from ground zero.  <br><br>What they game does have, however, is an auto-save feature peppered at various points in the levels.  I can\u2019t remember if this was in the original base game, but if not it\u2019s a nice addition all things considered.<br><br><b>Overall<\/b><br>An amazing game with the same problems as the 16-year old\/GOG version.  But totally worth it for 10 bucks!<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28172667', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28172667' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28172667\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28172667' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28172667\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28172667', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28172667_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28172667_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/557750\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28469619","28172667"]}
