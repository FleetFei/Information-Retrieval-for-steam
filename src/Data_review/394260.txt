Of course when it comes to rhythm games, timing is critical. Unfortunately, this game has no sync settings, which means that you may need to calibrate and adjust your graphics and audio settings in some other manner. Often times, I have to hit buttons earlier than hearing from the song in order to score a perfect hit.<br><br>Until the game gets more popular on Steam, online multiplayer is still very scarce. Considering its popularity on previous platforms (and more importantly, its age), it's still yet to be determined on whether or not anybody is willing to play online.<br><br>If you're a veteran rhythm gamer, you won't have a hard time learning and adapting to the controls and gameplay rules at all. Considering your experiences, you might find the AI in tournament and skirmish battles to be a little too merciful.<br><br>Dance Magic is a nice, light, casual game for the rhythm game fanatic that carries the essences of previously well-known titles and creates a slightly distinguishable twist on how it can be played, either alone or against others.

With three different game modes, including a unique Battle mode, prepare to dance your way through the 30+ pre-designed (or infinite amount of custom) songs! Local and online coop is supported.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><u><b>Tournament Mode<\/b><\/u><br>Tournament mode is essentially a string of pre-determined AI dance battles, similar to Battle Mode. Your tournament begins by choosing one of three starting characters, after which 5 eccentric AI enemies will line up for you to face. A sort of progression element is included in the form of character, equipment, and music\/song unlockables. The currency needed to unlock these items are attained through this Tournament Mode.<br><br><u><b>Battle Mode<\/b><\/u><br>The controlled character has a set of 5 different moves to help defeat the opposing character by reducing their health to zero. These moves are: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><b>Attack<\/b>: basic attack that will drain the enemy\u2019s health.<br><\/li><li><b>Rage<\/b>: an attack that deals double the amount of damage a basic attack would, however, is completely negated if it encounters an enemy\u2019s shield.<br><\/li><li><b>Shield<\/b>: reduces damage of an incoming Attack, or negates a Rage attack. Max: 3 active shields.<br><\/li><li><b>Dispel<\/b>: destroys a single enemy shield.<br><\/li><li><b>Interrupt<\/b>: interrupts the enemy\u2019s current combo chain.<\/li><\/ul><br>These moves are individually performed by hitting four specific button inputs to the song's beat. Each character has a different pattern for each move so they are not truly interchangeable, but it is relatively easy to memorize the button prompts after a little bit of playing. Performing a specific combination of moves will provide you with a stun attack (ie. Attack + Shield + Dispel) which lasts for a few seconds.<br><br>This unique game mode is a very refreshing twist to the generic match-the-notes-to-the-rhythm\/SHMUP-rhythm games. By forcing the player to adhere to rhythmic requirements, a lot of pressure and anxiety is created when you know what move you have to do, but must play to the beat. Although I am a huge fan of rhythm games, I always welcome new takes on beat-play.<br><br><u><b>Dance Mode<\/b><\/u><br>A static chart (note board) will begin to populate itself with notes as a moving bar scrolls through the chart. Your goal is to press the required button input as the bar scrolls over the respective button prompts. This is very similar to other rhythm games (DDR, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, etc.) with the exception that the line (or receptors) moves as opposed to the chart\/notes. Although the notes are presented well before the bar moves over it, in order to allow the player to prepare ahead of time, bonus notes are sporadically injected throughout the songs which appear at any time (sometimes right before the bar is about to move over it). This adds a very fun element of surprise and player engagement. When choosing a song to play (many will be locked at the beginning), the player has the option to select Beginner, Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty levels. These are offered for play variety and are freely changeable in between songs.<br><br><u><b>Custom Songs<\/b><\/u><br>My favorite component of Dance Magic is its support for custom songs in Dance Mode - BPM (beats per minute) calibration is needed. The BPM calibration is extremely simple; just hit any random note to the beat of your song. Although the BPM calibration will suffice, and comes handy as a cheap method for custom song support, the notes\/chart could be much more harmonized with the music if they implemented a beat analyzer instead. As it is, due to the unpredictability of a song and note\/chart generation off of a single average BPM, certain parts of a song will feel a little awkward\/de-synchronized to play. Audiosurf does a fantastic job with song analyzation by deconstructing a song and creating a moveable track from it; something Dance Magic could take note of. <br>    <br>Either way, I am still very happy that DM supports custom songs, as there are only a handful (or less) of games on Steam that do. Also, it might be nice to know that no matter how many notes you miss, you cannot fail. This also applies to the native songs provided by the game. This feature allows you to enjoy your music at a high difficulty level without getting pre-maturely cutoff, like in many other rhythm games.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div>There doesn't seem to be much of an online community, if any, but I don't fault them for that. Dance magic is such a fun dance\/music\/rhythm game that even if I could only play it solo or with a local coop buddy, I would still be satisfied. Especially since there is support for <b>custom songs<\/b>. I can't stress how rare it is to find a rhythm game with custom song support. With this in mind, I can easily recommend Dance Magic to fans of the rhythm and music genre, or people that want to interact with their favorite music.<br><br><table class=\"bb_table\"><tr><td>Review copy provided by Targem Games<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br><table class=\"bb_table\"><tr><td><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/BeforeYouBuy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Before You Buy<\/a> \u2013 analyses of newly released indie games<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25083244', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25083244' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25083244\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25083244' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25083244\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25083244', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25083244_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25083244_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21878163\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">Warwick J.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/games\/?tab=all\">4,672 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/\">269 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/394260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFinally\u2026. Dance Magic has come to Steam. If you smell what Targem Games is cookin\u2019.<br><br>No seriously folks, those of you who are familiar with this title will know precisely where I\u2019m coming from. And well, those of you who don\u2019t know it, all hail the ayatollah of rock and rollah babay! Dance Magic was originally developed and released onto the PlayStation 3 back in January of 2013. It has taken over three years for Targem Games to port their rhythm-music title onto the PC and eventually sell it on Steam. Really, you cannot blame them entirely. While there are quite a number of rhythm games as a genre on Steam there are not very many dance specific rhythm games on the platform. Therefore porting the game to PC for sale on Steam \u2013 and elsewhere \u2013 was always going to be a bit of a gamble. Therefore Steam users will have raised an eyebrow when they saw Targem Games name attached to a rhythm title. The self-publisher has action, racing, strategy and RPG games with having published such titles as Planets Under Attack, Battle Mages and Hard Truck Apocalypse \/ Ex Machina.<br><br>So what do you need to know about the game that isn\u2019t listed under the Steam description? To begin with there are three game formats available to you to begin with at the beginning of play including Tournament, Battle and Dance modes.<br><br>In tournament mode you play against a computer AI and when you win you earn in game currency which enables you to purchase cosmetic additions for your characters. The cosmetics that are available for purchase are different for each character, for example, Reaper has a number of different scythes that she is able to wield while dancing whereas Macho has a number of canes available to him among other pieces of cosmetics including hats, shirts, etc. It\u2019s pretty cool and a nice way of making tournaments worth their while. Tournaments are what Targem Team label \u2018campaigns\u2019 in the Steam description but are called tournaments in game.<br><br>Battle mode includes skirmish \u2013 basically a one round version of tournament mode \u2013 as well as multiplayer. I\u2019m not certain why a player who is battling the AI would choose to play skirmish mode instead of tournament mode because the reward for playing is better in tournament mode. I suppose it\u2019s a decent way to practice but I\u2019d prefer tournament mode.<br><br>There is also dance mode. This is my favorite mode because I believe that it is set up better. It is much easier to tell the rhythm of the game in this mode and you are given a defined key to press in rhythm to the music. I found this mode to be much more enjoyable. I found that the way in which the rhythm stuff is set up in tournament and battle modes to be rather annoying. There is a significantly higher barrier to entry for that mode than there is for dance mode. As such I tended to play it a lot more. The good news is that when you are ready to play at a higher difficulty setting in dance mode there are global leaderboards that you can target. This means that there is a level of competition in the most basic of modes. Of course, it would be nice if you could unlock in game currency in this mode making it possible to avoid tournament mode altogether if you wanted to unlock the cosmetics. That you\u2019re locked into playing tournament mode is a bit of a downer.<br><br>In all though, I\u2019m quite thankful that Targem Games finally ported their game onto PC and made it available on Steam. It\u2019s a really good dance game that deserves an opportunity if you enjoy this type of game. Unfortunately as I do not currently possess a dance mat I don\u2019t know whether or not they work with the game. However, given that tournament mode requires the press of the left and right thumbsticks I\u2019m guessing that the answer to that would be a negative. It\u2019s still a very enjoyable game without one.<br><br>For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/<\/a><br><br>To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Steamified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Steam Group<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21878163', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21878163' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21878163\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21878163' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21878163\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21878163', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21878163_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21878163_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23047866\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51982778\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51982778\">Nerney9<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/games\/?tab=all\">6,889 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/recommended\/\">29 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/recommended\/394260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Dance Magic for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Short Version:<\/b>  Cartoony dancers shoot sparkly bubbles at each other by bopping to the beat for... reasons? The main catch to this rhythm game is the addition of strategy to your dance 'battles'. You choose whether to attack, defend, interrupt, or string together special moves by inputting combos in time with the music.  Decent visuals, controls that work alright (even without my beloved dancepad of yore), a vast song selection from artists you've never heard of, and a completely ridiculous concept combine to make this game either wonderfully terrible or terribly wonderful;  Probably a little bit of both. <br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br>+ Dance Battles - with glowy magic sparks shooting at the other guy\/gal when you do it right!<br>+ Rhythm Fights<br>+ Tempo Tussles<br>+ Fixed-Time-Interval Engagements<br>+ More Dance Battles!<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>- Multiplayer seems completely dead (unless you plan ahead with someone you know), so single-player is where it's at.  The solo tounaments can still be pretty challenging at higher stages at least.<br><br>- Dance Magic is no DDR.  The main mode is a strategic rhythm-fighting game where you simply need to stick to the beat while you input combos - no syncopated off-beat quicksteps here. While there IS a 'freestyle' mode with preset, complicated patterns to dance to, this is almost impossible to do with a controller on the harder difficulties.  Additionally, instead of the incoming steps scrolling to a point where you press them (like every other dance game ever), in this mode you must follow a blue bar down the screen which resets up to the top pac-man style, refreshing the next few measures of 'sheet music' steps at that point.  It's a clumsy design, so even if you own a PC-compatible dancemat*, showing off your crazy-mad dance skills (read: gloriously awkward flailing) to your friends\/neighbors\/cat probably won't be happening.  <br><br><i>*SIDENOTE:  On the plus side, you do win at life just for owning said dancemat, so kudos to you.<\/i><br><br>- <b>IMPORTANT NOTE\/BUG:<\/b>  Apparently the cosmetic items in the in-game-Shop can be glitched. causing the game to freeze up when you enter the 'Shop' section.  If you experience this, there IS a work-around: mash 'Spacebar' a few times as soon as you enter the Shop so the game doesn't try to load the glitched content, then press 'Tab' to reach the all-important song and character unlocks (which work just fine).  If you want to obtain the dress-up items too, you should make sure this bug has been patched before you purchase the game.<br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Received a free copy for testing\/reviewing purposes.

In the tournament, when you beat an opponent, you will be rewarded with money. <br><br>With this money, you will be able to unlock a stacks of items for each of the dancers.

They sound great, and fluid. No stutter or rubbish. Now that's brilliant in my view. And if you prefer a little extra, you get to play your own songs you already own in your computer by dragging into a game specific folder, and calibrate the bpm(beats-per-minute) yourself in-game. I played Alexandra Stan's Mr. Saxo Beat for custom and it was a smooth process of preparation and play all the way to end with no faults on my loaded music after import. So music is a pass in my point.<br><br>Next, we have graphics. Runs well on my computer with fluidity and and no tearing or stuttering. It's colourful and attractive, and fits the overall theme conveyed by the game. Character textures are great, so there's no accidental intersection of the 3D models, or at least I don't really have time to look at the models while attempting to keep with what's happening. I have no complaints and don't really have much take on this, but it's still a pass in my view.<br><br>Then, we have the all important gameplay. I have a complaint or two, but it's nothing major. Or could be, but here's my take. It's relatively simple and easy to catch on, and the tutorials are short and sweet. Tthat's a plus. Now what's interesting and different about this game is that, you may compare Dance Magic to other music dance battle games like Bust-A-Groove, Audition, whatever. It's almost similar. But here, you don't just enter keys as quickly as you can to match the keys that grow increassingly long in length to finish within a beat. The keys are provided for you, and they're always there and same, but you must follow the beat of the flashing metronome or you'll strike a miss before you even know what's happening. It's fresh, and I like it. Although, I would consider it a plus if keys actually do change after every completion of a set. As per things are now, I could memorise the keys, close my eyes and follow the beats and still win because there's not much of a challenge, however enjoyable it still is.<br><br>There are two modes in the game. Battle and freestyle. Oh, how interesting isn't it. But really, it is. They're two completely different modes of gameplay. Battle would be close to the gameplay mechanic I have described above, and freestyle is more like the DDR(Dance Dance Revolution) kind of gameplay, except directional arrows don't float up or anywhere. It simply stays there. And since I'm on point with the freestyle, let me start from here. I have a major complaint about this mode, but some would think otherwise. Freestyle mode sets a pink window with the directional keys for tapping at the precise beat of the song as a single glowing blue bar repeatedly flows down and back from top again, signalling the time to hit your keys. The window is locked to the left of your screen. That's fine. You get to enjoy the view of your dancer and the vivid backgrounds. Unfortunately, my complaint is that sometimes the flashing of lights or even a whole screen full of confettis can distract you. Maybe I'm just more easily distracted. Fine. But sometimes these distractions affect so that I can't focus on where the blue glowing bar is because there's too much going on in the screen at that moment. Fine, maybe it's just me.<br><br>And here's about the battle mode. It's basically what you know about music dance battle games like the earlier examples I've aforementioned. But here's what makes Dance Magic stands out. Like I said, this isn't a test of your godspeed fingers. It's about recognising beats and with that, you battle out with your opponents with moves of attacks, defenses, and interruptions. These are fresh concepts, and I like them. There are specialty moves that deal extra damage or buffs you. They may also be a great way to boost combo meter, and only considerable if they are defense and interruptions. They can rack up combos easily and help break opponent shields to get attacks through. Combos can also help you deal extra damage, but attack specialties themselves can sometimes K.O. your opponent faster than racking combos and dishing damage. But that's sometimes. There's no timer if you don't press a key and that means no miss. So watch what's happening on screen, but be smart with the real time battle. So back on point with the mechanic, I've also mentioned earlier it's not anymore challenging with the same set of keys, lest the increase of bpm on difficulty. But if I've to make a choice, I prefer this mode over the freestyle.<br><br>Narrations are all over the game, which isn't that bad, but it isn't always great. In battle modes, I have found that with my focus everywhere when things get messy, they help you by letting you know what is happening at the moment. When you're missing, stunned, ready to stun or when you're doing fine, the narration can be all over but may help. When it comes to freestyle, I have no clue what it serves for. It's distracting, and sometimes narrated at a point it disrupts your rhythm and voila, I missed. I don't need a person to tell me I'm a legend or amazing or that my mom would be proud of me the whole time I'm trying to focus on where my glowing blue bar is to prevent a miss. So there, it's not that bad, but I wasn't a fan. At least his voice wasn't hard on my ears. A-ok. Perfects, greats and misses could have had different sound effects too.<br><br>You're probably wondering by now, &quot;When are you going to talk about the multiplayer?&quot; Well, here's your answer. I never got down to experience it because no servers were ever found for me. It's relatively sparse, considering the game is new and on assumption that not a lot of people own it. Here's hoping I'll find a friend or two to play with me so I can earn me some achievements along the way. But here's the good news. You can play multiplayer for both battle and freestyle. So take your pick guys, and get on those leaderboards when you find an opponent to play with.<br><br>Lastly, you're going to question about individuality in the game. Sure, customisations are minimal and most-importantly-not-ugly, and are readily available with no garbage micro-transactions. I sincerely hope there would be more than what's readily available in the future, but I have a good feeling that may come with micro-transactions. I mean, as much as we like an all-in-one package or freebies, you can't always expect a developer to dish out more than you're paying for. It's not always fair. But that's beside the point. One complaint I have, however minor, it would be extremely pleasing to eye if the developers could give each shop item their own skin icon instead of using the default skin icon for every single item listing. It's somewhat troublesome to click on every single item to see it dressed on your character in the shop, no matter the name of the item on list. It makes shopping easier, really.<br><br>So, I mean, all in all, it's not a bad game but may not be everyone's jam. It wasn't what I thought it was, but still enough fun to keep me going. I had secretly harboured the wish and desired that freestyle was closer to the battle mode, and similar to games like Bust-A-Groove or Audition instead of the DDR style, but here's what makes it unique as Dance Magic. There can be improvements, maybe new characters or songs, but for whatever it was priced and offered in game at release? Sure. I'll recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21357605', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21357605' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21357605\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21357605' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21357605\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21357605', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21357605_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21357605_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/recommended\/394260\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24678395\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"131420538\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f31f18d9942277ac7b68dbd6b3c38083edee4ae3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f31f18d9942277ac7b68dbd6b3c38083edee4ae3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f31f18d9942277ac7b68dbd6b3c38083edee4ae3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"131420538\">DarkZoregon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/games\/?tab=all\">973 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/recommended\/\">37 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkZoregon\/recommended\/394260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Dance Magic for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDance Magic, rhythm game action subgenre in which its simple goal is to be the best and for that you need a lot of attention to the right time for the movement, or even pay attention to the beat to perform the actions to perfection.<br>* <b>Controls<\/b>: arrow keys (there variables) and space.<br>* <b>Difficulty<\/b>: beginner, easy, medium and hard<br>* <b>Number of stages<\/b>: 5<br>There are several game modes, including multiplayer, however I will focus me to quote about the game modes, which is divided into two types.

The battle is literally a fight where both have a life bar that as the other creates more combos life opponent is drained slowly that to reach zero the battle ends.<br>NOTE: Depending on the amount of mistakes you commit or number of hits your opponent does, it can cause dizziness and to free you should make a fixed sequence of movements.<br><br>The game also has a store and it is possible to find:<br>- Clothing, skins and accessories in general<br><br>- Music<br><br>- Characters<br>NOTE: Perhaps the best way to get money in the game is the tournament mode, where the farther more received and lost battles can be repeated until the victory.

Characters will dance on the right and left side of the screen, you can use five basic moves to beat opponent. Basic attacks always do some damage, Rage attacks do double damage but ineffective agains shield. Next 2 moves put up a shields for you and take down an enemy shields. The last one is important for combo multiplier.<br>If you like rhythm games and looking for something more, this game is for you!  <br>My rating: 8.5\/10<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21717744', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21717744' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21717744\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21717744' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21717744\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21717744', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21717744_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21717744_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21401540\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FiauraTheTankGirlGamer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"43813854\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72481bf6b94f2f30ebe999268527219dd45cd98e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72481bf6b94f2f30ebe999268527219dd45cd98e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72481bf6b94f2f30ebe999268527219dd45cd98e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FiauraTheTankGirlGamer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"43813854\">Fiaura The Tank Girl<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FiauraTheTankGirlGamer\/games\/?tab=all\">316 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FiauraTheTankGirlGamer\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FiauraTheTankGirlGamer\/recommended\/394260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm not really a person for rhythm games, actually I suck at them.
