If you've played Jensen's previous games (e.g. Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter), then you might have certain (high) expectations.<br><br>If you are a Jane Jensen fan, you probably won't be (too) disappointed. Her signature strengths are mostly here. The game has many flaws, but they will likely be tolerated by most.<br><br>Additionally, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, you are even more likely to appreciate this, as there are numerous similarities (e.g. likable antisocial lead with high intelligence and observational prowess, awkward bromance with sidekick).<br><br>If you are unfamiliar with Jane Jensen but like adventure games, then (assuming you even exist) this might not be the best place to start unless you can get it cheap. Also, you should be aware that this, like other Jensen stories, are, uh, somewhat &quot;metaphysical&quot; in nature. If you need a game to be squarely constrained by generally accepted physical laws of reality, then you might want to pass on this.<br><br>GOOD<br>* Good writing<br>* Clever blend of real and fake history and current events<br>* Great voice acting<br>* Good music (though seems a bit inappropriate at times to me)<br>* Great concept<br>* Good story<br>* (mostly) Good art (somewhat inconsistent)<br>* Interesting 'analysis' puzzle concepts (but, can be frustrating sometimes)<br><br>NEUTRAL<br>* Old school point system<br>* Mostly easy and straightforward, but some rough points<br>* Mostly unoriginal puzzles<br>* Hotkey to reveal interactive objects in scenes (except <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>in the maze at the end<\/span><\/span>) with intuitive radial interface<br>* Hint system exists, but I haven't tried it<br>* Low budget CG cutscenes, 3D models<br>* Many &quot;missable&quot; achievements<br><br>BAD<br>* Weak, inconsistent writing in places<br>* Some terrible animations (e.g. Malachi's walking)<br>* Needlessly frustrating <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>maze<\/span><\/span> puzzle at the end<br>* Glitchy scripting, including some game breaking bugs (save often!)<br>* Some interface glitches<br>* Aforementioned bugs have gone unresolved for over a year, new bugs were added with post-release updates<br>* At least one broken achievement<br><br>Parting thought - I can't help feel that this could have been a much better game. But, I enjoyed it. There is also hope for the future as this seems quite open for additional titles in a series (though this title is quite self-contained).<br><br>Disclosure: I received a copy of this game as a gift from a friend (thanks!)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22051556', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22051556' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22051556\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22051556' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22051556\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22051556', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22051556_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22051556_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9836774\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dekonega\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"17109048\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e9\/e96910e25c4f7cf20089cb98bae78d604b227b51.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e9\/e96910e25c4f7cf20089cb98bae78d604b227b51.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e9\/e96910e25c4f7cf20089cb98bae78d604b227b51_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dekonega\/\" data-miniprofile=\"17109048\">Dekonega<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dekonega\/games\/?tab=all\">559 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dekonega\/recommended\/\">57 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dekonega\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMoebius is an entertaining and decently good point n' click game that lacks a lot of polish. Jane Jensen's story is bit silly but interesting. Robert Holme's music is fantastic but bit repeatitive. The gameplay is little bit disappointing because of the narrow amount of choises you can make. Moebius feels like a simplified and slightly modernized version of those 90s point n' click adventure games that we all grew up with. The length of the game is around 10 to 15 hours for an average player.<br><br>I liked the characters in the game and I liked the story. Althought I do have to write that Jane Jensen in past has written better material than this. There're issues with the narrative that feel stupid after you've played the game though. And even during the game you occasionally wonder why certain things had to be done in a particular way.<br><br>Moebius is a fairly basic point n' click game that doesn't do anything particularly well or bad. It's like it was made following a googled tutorial on how to make a point n' click adventure game. It doesn't add anything new or even try to challenge the existing concepts.<br><br>Most of the puzzles in Moebius are fairly easy to figure out. There's usually only one route to take to a puzzle and only one solution for that puzzle exists. Sometimes the solution is rather unrealistic. To avoid making Moebius a &quot;hidden object&quot; game and to add some realism into it the game doesn't allow you to pick up items or go to some places until the need to do so arises. That leads to an issue where you need to remember place of certain items you previously couldn't pick up. Occasionally there are more challenging puzzles that are well written. The main character also has infinite pockets to stuff things to which I thought was amusing.<br><br>Towards the ending of the Moebius started to fell apart. For example (without spoiling anything) the player needs to fly from Washington to New York to pick alcohol from a bar the main character has contantly refused to enter into any given point of time during the game. There's nothing indicating you need to do so. I don't even understand why there couldn't be alcohol store at Washington player could enter. This is done so because main character thought that the antique item in his shop he saw earlier would still be there and that he needed to pick that up for a certain character. This is done based upon observation of that character's tastes. And so upon exiting antique store main character thought that he would also need to bring alcohol seeing the bar on other side of the street. That is some truly horrible game writing and game design in my opinion.<br><br>Graphics in Moebius are decent and I like the art style. But this is probably a good point to start talking about the bugs. Moebius has lots of bugs. None of those bugs break the game and they're mostly just visual annoyances. Such as main character is able to stand on certain places he isn't supposed to be able to stand. Or certain water effects are places on surfaces where they shouldn't be. Occasionally the animations have timing problems. Sometimes there are texture related issues such as really low resolution textures. None of the visual issues are dramatically bad. It's just a sign of a lack of polish in Moebius.<br><br>Music and audio is good and there are lots of nice music. However sometimes the main theme just repeats itself so much that it's the only thing you'll remember after you've played the game. This is due the fact that the main theme is also present in various tracks in a suttle ways. So even if I do like the main theme quite a bit, it became an annoyance to hear so often during the game. Sometimes there were audio tracks where the mixing had failed. Voice acting in this game is decently played out.<br><br>User Interface of the Moebius is weird but it works. There are no &quot;verbs&quot; which makes the game easier to play since the game always offers only the actions you can do with various points of interest. Moebius is designed towards people who have little or no experience with point n' click adventure games. The way UI has been designed and the strong hint system in this game reflects that. I also thought it was weird that the game didn't have end results screen despite counting points in a similar manner to the classic Sierra adventure games all which have the end results screen.<br><br>Technically the game works fine most of the time. But being based on top of Unity Engine has all the good things and all the issues that come with the Unity Engine. For example the game has freezing issues on certain hardware. But those can be corrected with a launch parameter. And sometimes the rendering quality is pretty bad.<br><br>To sum things up, Moebius is entertaining game which is fun to play. The story is interesting but sometimes badly written. I liked the main characters and would like to see more of their adventures in the future. Moebius as a game also severely lacks polish and fine tuning. It's worth the cost but it's not outstanding game like Gabriel Knight or Gray Matter.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9836774', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9836774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9836774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9836774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9836774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9836774', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9836774_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9836774_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11580900\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/longleggedbeastie\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"46029210\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a2\/a28e86085b6fb4d94c2d3a4684aa45c01dafeaca.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a2\/a28e86085b6fb4d94c2d3a4684aa45c01dafeaca.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a2\/a28e86085b6fb4d94c2d3a4684aa45c01dafeaca_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/longleggedbeastie\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46029210\">fiftydwarves<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/longleggedbeastie\/games\/?tab=all\">861 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/longleggedbeastie\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/longleggedbeastie\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 6, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you like good games? Then this game is not for you. Do you like demented puzzles and being annoyed out of your pants? Then this game IS for you. Ironically, though, I have no doubt whether to recommend it or not - I enjoyed it, a lot. Guess it's a question of what you're looking for. <br><br>If you're looking for Cesar Bittar, by jove you've found him. It is obviously a game developed solely by him without any involvement of that pesky Jane Jensen whatsoever. Or at least by Phoenix Online, and not by Pinkerton Road at all. Pay attention. <br><br>If you're looking for, say, cool characters, then you should marry it - Malachi and David are amazing, and everything that concerns them is done brilliantly. From the beginning of their friendship through all the shunning of Gretchen to the pointed indifference to Amble it's downright adorable, sincere and applauds-inducing. And man, I love these straight to the point dialogues where characters are saying the most logical things that suit the situation. I can't say enough just how perfectly it is done. It was  a pure enjoyment and a crate of marbles in a world of pervasive bureaucracy and Leisure Suit Larry remakes.<br>Unlike everything else in the game. <br><br>The story? Have you heard of the world's silliness contest of '72? Where Helen Slapps was standing on one leg on a frozen turkey with a thrashing fish in her mouth and an open urn of ashes on her head, and playing a triangle? It was waaay less silly than the plot of Moebius. <br><br>The puzzles? Oh, don't even start about the puzzles. When I was flying back to Chicago from New Orleans because I forgot to pack my toothbrush, that was painful. And this game made me relieve the experience. Honestly, the only good thing about them is that they're easier than the ones in The Walking Dead. <br><br>The graphics? You know you have issues when you visit New York, Venice and Zurich, and the only pretty place is still a bar in New York.<br><br>The music? Well, there were some niceish pieces, but nothing comparable to Gray Matter.<br><br>The technical issues? I thought it's good pairing when characters are walking through one another on a regular basis.<br><br>I must say, it IS a Jane Jensen's game, mainly meaning that it's amazingly written and tries to tackle metaphysical issues with a healthy dose of excitement and a pinch of old fashioned naivety. It is worth your playthrough. It's good like that. It's just you'll have to put up with its \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, and there're surprisingly big amounts for a game you can complete in ten hours. <br>So there. Scratch what I said, don't marry it.

It\u2019s mature and somewhat relevant to real global events and pulls you right in the mood for a grand mystery.<br>* Malachi is a TERRIFIC main character! He\u2019s well-written, multi-dimensional and evolving through the story\u2026 (I was hunting for all the hotspots just to hear what he had to say about them!)<br>* Another thing about Malachi\u2026 His VA (Owen Thomas) hit the role out of the ballpark! His was the best performance in the game by far. He MADE the character, not unlike Tim Curry made Gabriel Knight.<br>* David is also a great sidekick to Kye, and there\u2019s a great chemistry between the two.<br>* Robert Holmes, again, paired the game seamlessly with a terrific Soundtrack, ranging from mysterious ambient themes to action-packed thrilling rock pieces.<br>* The multiple locals are diverse and beautifully rendered and colorful on most chapters.<br>* The game is pretty long and will take an average player from 9 to 12 hours to complete, depending on how long you\u2019ll get stuck.<br><br>Now to the cons:<br>* Some characters\u2019 body proportions and \/ or postures are way off, too bad one of those characters is the main one.<br>* Animations are ranging from mediocre to bad.<br>* They are also unbearably slow, esp. when there are multiple animations performed in a row.<br>* The music is sometimes too loud and you have to rely on the subtitles. (The prison scene and some movies towards the end come to mind).<br>* The subtitles going up from the bottom of the screen and flying out again is annoying and straining on the eyes, especially during short sentences.<br>* Some puzzles felt too simple and the game \u201cheld your hand\u201d while solving them. (Sometimes getting stuck is a good thing in an adventure game!)<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9870916', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9870916' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9870916\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9870916' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9870916\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9870916', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9870916_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9870916_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 65 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9833477\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197990538865\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"30273137\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4a\/4a0a032dddba2a2c16fac6b761b43f3ca2544160.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4a\/4a0a032dddba2a2c16fac6b761b43f3ca2544160.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4a\/4a0a032dddba2a2c16fac6b761b43f3ca2544160_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197990538865\/\" data-miniprofile=\"30273137\">hatterwar<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197990538865\/games\/?tab=all\">335 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197990538865\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197990538865\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI made a negative review about this game elsewhere prior to fully completing the story and I'm kinda sad that I did. The game's technical issues which are glaringly obvious when you first start the game gradually got better along the way. The story takes a little bit to actually get going but it is decent. With that being said though, the horrible animation (walking animations, climbing, talking etc.) really takes away from what is quite a decent game to play. I think some of the smaller bugs will be fixed over time (eg: cursor disappearing, skipping dialog causing the characters to move in fast forward etc) but overall the game was enjoyable.<br><br>Malachi is not very likeable, the voice actor is really good at what he does in other roles (Omid from Walking Dead Season 1\/2) and a few characters from LoL for example but he seemed really flat in this particular role which was disappointing. <br><br>It's not a groundbreaking story to tell but it's definitely a decent one for the genre :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9833477', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9833477' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9833477\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9833477' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9833477\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9833477', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9833477_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9833477_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21036081\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"74554652\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/41\/417003ccfd53296ba003ae172342b8a8ddf9960b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/41\/417003ccfd53296ba003ae172342b8a8ddf9960b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/41\/417003ccfd53296ba003ae172342b8a8ddf9960b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74554652\">Gingergal<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/games\/?tab=all\">534 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034820380\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJane Jensen is a master not just with intelligent plotlines (which sadly is rare in adventure games) but is also the master of storytelling and editing.  Giving succinct but a lot of valuable information in various ways as to never be boring and, if you are like me, learn a lot while having a heap of fun at the same time.<br><br>The storyline background was art history and the unfolding plot was about Moebius Theory (there are the same patterns throughout history, everything repeats itself) <br><br>  Your character is an antiques dealer who becomes involved with an organisation that wants his insight into a few people.  You investigate each character which have information points, once you collect all the points you solve a puzzle by comparing these character's facts with historical figures.  Along the way, we see how the Moebius Theory unfolds through him personally and the people he is investigating.<br><br>Each chapter is usually in a different country, but with only about 2-3 places to visit in each country, you don't get lost and it is very easy to go back and forth via a map if you miss something, thus minimising or eliminating the need for hints (which this game does have) or a walkthrough.  There are a few puzzles but even with the <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> obligatory maze at the end <\/span><\/span> there are logical clues.<br><br>Glitches in the achievements have been fixed, they all now work.<br><br>Now to the not so great:<br>-  Artwork - sometimes is in the just OK range <br>- The multi-step inventory, I could have done without the 'envelope' icon and just use the interactive icon when I wanted to use an item.<br>- Main character is plain 'I want to bonk him in the head' annoying. <br><br> He does improve a bit as gameplay progresses but not quickly enough to care about what happens to him till near the end, where there is a redeemable characteristic.  In Gabriel Knight the main character was a sexist pig at times but he also was a lovable rogue.  Sherlock Holmes was very loyal and really nice to people he found interesting.  House M.D over time, was very loyal and cared in his own way to people in his life.  This game isn't long enough to develop a &quot;House&quot; type character.<br><br>Overall I loved it, preferring the storyline and plot over GK and Grey Matter.  Maybe if Jensen had more unlimited funding it would have been a longer more involved game in every way than GK and even Contradiction.   But, it's still a really good game, good puzzles, great plot, dialogue and well worth playing.  I really recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21036081', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21036081' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21036081\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21036081' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21036081\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21036081', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21036081_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21036081_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11891569\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985232409\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"24966681\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/810a4848234f99a56bb43fe8e1591faa2c828de7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/810a4848234f99a56bb43fe8e1591faa2c828de7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/810a4848234f99a56bb43fe8e1591faa2c828de7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985232409\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24966681\">jergabo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985232409\/games\/?tab=all\">1,563 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985232409\/recommended\/\">19 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985232409\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 27, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMoebius: Empire Rising is a point and click adventure game by Jane Jensen and published by Phoenix Online Studios. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the name Jane Jensen, she is one of the big names in adventure games from back when adventure games were the showcase genre of the PC who are still working primarily in that  genre.  I don\u2019t want to go all auteur theory, but Jensen\u2019s is important because Moebius is recognizably the kind of game she\u2019s been making for the last couple decades. There\u2019s a pulpy, melodramatic concept and story. There are some continually repeated minigames that are too simplistic but seem like they could be great with a little more work. There\u2019s an annoying maze area that should have been cut entirely from the game. Basically, fans of Gray Matter will probably like this. For those who haven\u2019t played Gray Matter, some more explanation is probably needed.<br><br>Moebius is traditional in design, to the point of being predictable.  You pick up objects, and use them on other objects in a, hopefully, logical way to advance the plot. The only change to the standard gameplay is that Moebius only lets you pick things up when the puzzle requiring them has been reached. So you can\u2019t just pick up a boat pole and carry it around for no reason, unlike the kleptomaniacs who starred in the adventure games of old. Occasionally you need to guess passwords, but this is usually done by selecting the password from a drop-down menu, there is one that you enter manually, so the passwords aren\u2019t fundamentally different from finding and using items. The passwords also provided the best example of how the game is too eager to keep thing moving for the puzzles to be really engaging, Late in the game there is a password that involves using cryptography to decode the password hint. You\u2019re provided with various keys and three methods of encryption and decryption to figure out the password.  It could have been an interesting exercise in figuring out how to use the different methods. Instead you\u2019re brought to an interface that applies the encryption for you. All that the player is left to do is apply the cipher and copying down the decrypted message. A shorter way to put it, this is one of maybe three that I\u2019ve managed to complete without a walkthrough.<br><br>The game isn\u2019t all item puzzles and passwords, though. There are two minigames intended to emulate the classic \u201cSherlock scan\u201d and the comparison of modern and historical people respectively. In the Sherlock Holmes minigame you\u2019re given different qualities of a person, like \u201cshifty eyes,\u201d and then select one of three options for what it tells you about that person. This isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea, but these options always break down the same way. One is an obvious joke option, one is relevant but doesn\u2019t actually relate to a character trait, and one just flat-out tells you some character trait of the person you\u2019re analyzing. Comparing people to historical figures is probably the biggest disappointment of the game. You are given a list of traits and next to each of these traits are the historical figures who had those traits, then you need to figure out which of the historical figures shares the most traits. So if someone has seven traits in common with Eli Whitney and one in common with Chuang Zi, you need to sigh deeply and imagine what could have been. It really should have been an exercise in comparing and contrasting information is instead a test of whether you can count. <br><br>The story is very much in line with the goofy-but-sincere gothic melodrama that Jane Jensen usually does. Malachi Rector (keep in mind that Jensen\u2019s Gray Matter featured a character who wore a literal Phantom of the Opera mask without a trace of irony) is asked by a mysterious quasi-governmental organization named FITA (which was sadly changed from the far more appropriate FIST) to determine if the life of a recently murdered woman resembles any historical figures. After carrying out his mission, he is attacked by ninjas, who photograph his passport, and finds out that he is the center of various conspiracies and so it goes. I don\u2019t want to expand on the plot too much, because people hate spoilers. I will say that if you\u2019re a fan of Jorge Louis-Borges, you might be disappointed, as it\u2019s nothing as clever as that. It is a very entertaining pulp sci-fi story that has a lot of genuinely well done moments, and runs with its central conceit fairly well. I really thought the story was a strong point of the game, except for one problem.<br><br>The problem with the story is Malachi Rector. He is a whiny, entitled, self-righteous, narcissistic, judgmental prick. They were obviously trying to emulate the BBC Sherlock, with Malachi as the insufferable genius who everyone needs despite his grating personality. They even tried to emulate the look of the BBC Sherlock in many of the cutscenes, with floating text to represent Malachi\u2019s analysis of the situation. The BBC Sherlock has a couple of advantages, however. First, that has Watson around to look at the camera and sympathize with the viewer, and, second, Sherlock is not the viewpoint character and you get an occasional break from him. The Watson in Moebius is so bland I\u2019ve entirely forgotten his name and Malachi is the viewpoint character for most of the game, which means almost everything the game tells you is passed along by him; this is a problem when most people will want to punch Malachi in the face every time he speaks. I don\u2019t think it kills the story completely. If you keep in mind that he\u2019s supposed to be unlikeable, it\u2019s actually hilarious what a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 he is.<br><br>Graphically, it\u2019s exactly what you see on the screenshots and video above. It\u2019s got a nice stylized design intended to conceal the low quality of the models, the animation is a little off at times. Overall, I think it works well, when it works. The engine for Moebius, like Cognition, the previous game from this Phoenix Online, has a tendency to suddenly pitch a fit every so often and the character models starts flopping around, an absent character remains a hot spot in the level, or the game just locks up. I don\u2019t want to exaggerate this too much, I had four or five noticeable issues in the nine hours I spent playing the game. Three were cosmetic and only one, when the game locked up, required me to restart the game from an earlier save. I\u2019d advise you to save often, though, in case the game does suddenly freeze on you.<br> <br>To sum up, I may have accentuated the negative a little too much here. Moebius is a nicely traditional, if overly easy, point and click adventure game with an interesting plot that is partly kneecapped by unlikeable characters, oversimplified puzzles, and the occasional bugs. That sounds bad when you put them all together like that, but I really do recommend it if you like the genre. If you\u2019re not a fan of point and click adventure games, this probably isn\u2019t the best place to start. Maybe try the Blackwell games or Gemini Rue or something first.  <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11891569', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11891569' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11891569\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11891569' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11891569\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11891569', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11891569_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11891569_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14314310\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040488599\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"80222871\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040488599\/\" data-miniprofile=\"80222871\">takezo689<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040488599\/games\/?tab=all\">262 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040488599\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040488599\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7\/10<br>Although the puzzles were all rather easy, the story was intriguing enough to play to the end. It\u2019s not as bad as many of the reviewers make it sound.<br>I want to address a few point I\u2019ve seen in some reviews:<br>-This is not as good as Gabriel Knight.<br>Yes, we all love the GK series, but let\u2019s not forget you had to put tape on a fence to get cat hairs to make into a moustache. Moebius is not GK, it\u2019s different. Both have good and bad points, but it\u2019s unfair to compare a current game with your memory of how good another game was.<br>-Malachi is not likeable.<br>He\u2019s human. If you stopped to consider his character and what he has been through and seen, it\u2019s easy to see how he became \u201cnot likeable.\u201d I didn\u2019t find this a hindrance to the game at all. More importantly, his character evolves over the course of the game, which is lacking in many games.<br>-Animations\/graphics\/character models suck.<br>They aren\u2019t Final Fantasy graphics, but they serve their purpose. They\u2019re obviously much better than GK3 graphics, and everyone loved that game. Yes, smoother graphics would\u2019ve been nice, but it\u2019s not game-breaking.<br>-The game is buggy.<br>There were some bugs. They recently released a patch which was supposed to fix many of them. The bugs I encountered weren\u2019t game breaking; just skipped animations. But personally, I feel that bugs in an adventure game are less forgiving than other genres. You don\u2019t want to feel like \u201cmaybe I can\u2019t solve this puzzle because there\u2019s a bug.\u201d So minus points on this lack of polish.<br>Now on to the positives:<br>+ The story was interesting, and I liked how you had to make connections with historical people. The game (like all of Jensen\u2019s) was well researched and I felt that I came out of the game with new ideas or thoughts, which is more than can be said of many games.<br> + The puzzles were a bit on the easy side, and some were illogical (or just time wasters) but for the most part, they made sense.<br>I know I spent more time addressing negatives than adding positives, but overall, I thought the game was good. Not superb, but not half as bad as a lot of the reviews made it sound. There was nothing really ground-breaking with the game, but the story was strong enough to make it worth playing.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14314310', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14314310' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14314310\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14314310' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14314310\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14314310', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14314310_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14314310_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22018001\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023019965\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"62754237\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/910583ad3371d8dfd2fc97331b6474a484ef6557.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/910583ad3371d8dfd2fc97331b6474a484ef6557.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/910583ad3371d8dfd2fc97331b6474a484ef6557_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023019965\/\" data-miniprofile=\"62754237\">Pablo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023019965\/games\/?tab=all\">31 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023019965\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023019965\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">21.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the latest game(2014)  from Jane Jensen, creator of the Gabriel Knight series, a classic sierra's adventure game made in the 90s. She made very interesting puzzles at the time, and some terrible ones, but the end result always won. <br>Now, she comes back with a kickstarter project that begun in 2012 and came up in 2014, this time working independent, with little money of course, and a new small team of game devs called Phoenix online.<br><br>The truth be told, when i first tried the game, the first impression was pretty shocking, and not in a good way... Of course this is a small team working, with a tiny budget, but still there are some things that can't be justified just because having little money. What i mean is, the first impression was bad, and yes, i am talking about the graphics first, because that's one of the first things that you take from a game, but its not the only thing, also the game was bad (aparently) meaning the puzzles, and even the main character was bad, alltough this could be atributed to his akward way of walking (little joke there).<br><br>The thing is, the game starts to make some sense some time around the end of the third chapter (almost half of the whole game). The story starts to come around, there's this theory of moebius, of the pattern and these special persons (no spoilers here) and then the main character starts to develop, he becomes more interesting, he's having weird dreams and visions and it somehow relates to what is hapenning in the main story. The great music of Robert Holmes (creator of the gabriel knight soundtrack) comes in full force here, like in old times having some great moments, specially during the revelation moments. The puzzles, about analizing patterns and people starts to emerge  and it's something interesting to try and adds to the game. The graphics, still ugly, get somehow much more better, in terms of finishing and polish. It's like the game almost changes around the second half, and then you arrive at the last part of the game and all that diminishes somehow and you encounter the same problems, and the samethings from the first half.<br><br>And that's the problem, right there, a double problem. First, you have no consistency. Because , i liked this game (in parts) , meaning at first i didn't like it, then yes, and then no. So, it's like i've been playing two different games in one. So you have great elements, interesting story, great music, some interesting puzzles, but not at first, and not at the end, so when the game starts you don't really want to play it that much, then if you have patience you reach the good part, and then...in the end, you are left with a bad impression, again.<br><br>The second problem with this game is that, ive played it because i like (and knew) about past jane jensen's adventures, and i know what she is able to do in a game, and that's why i even continued playing this one after the start (and i did get my reward, i like this game) but if i didn't knew jane jensen was behind it i've probably wouldn't have tried it, and i don't see how people who are new to her would get interested in an adventure like this.<br><br>It's a shame because i love adventure games, and i want to see the genre succeed (and it is coming back in these last years) but not with games like this. The genre has to move forward, have great production values have great game mechanics, be modern, be fun to everybody, played by everybody, not only hardcore adventure gamers (without stop being and adventure game), like for example the Sherlock Holmes games by frogwares.<br><br> I liked Moebius, but i don't think it will appeal to people outside those who played old adventures games  (you can try fellow newcomer, but , you are warned) <br><br>It's a shame also, because to be honest, this game's story has great potential, and i see why jane jensen would like to continue it. In fact, her previous adventure game from 2010, Gray matter, didn't have as good a story as this , and funnily enough, that game had better graphics than this one. But Moebius has in fact a greater a story, one that it has certain moments that are more close in spirit to the 90s era with gabriel knight. Even the music is more close to the Gabriel knight series.<br>I have to say, in the end i liked moebius better than Gray matter. Moebius is a better game because it has heart in it, and it is more a jane jensen game than gray matter will ever be.<br><br>I can't recommend this game to everybody, but i like it, and that's why the positive thumbs up calification.<br>I would say that, from 2014, this was possibly the best story for and adventure game. but not the best game by far. <br>(see my other reviews for the best adventure from 2014)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22018001', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22018001' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22018001\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22018001' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22018001\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22018001', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22018001_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22018001_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10045935\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spartankitty\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"112812960\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3978fddf1401c3766e1b8c2e750109fd6d7f16a8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3978fddf1401c3766e1b8c2e750109fd6d7f16a8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3978fddf1401c3766e1b8c2e750109fd6d7f16a8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spartankitty\/\" data-miniprofile=\"112812960\">Nikki<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spartankitty\/games\/?tab=all\">41 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spartankitty\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spartankitty\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 7, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI bought this game right after finishing Cognition (highly recommended).

Definitely old school adventure game.  May not be the best game in this genre or not as good as Gabriel Knight, but I thought it was entertaining and good, nonetheless.  I refuse to nit pick this game because I miss this style of games.  Not enough of them are made anymore.  Therefore I appreciate it when one is made and will not be picky about reviewing it.  The game was fun, not too easy but not impossible, the plot was enjoyable, the characters were likeable and played well, the look of the game was nice, and gameplay was easy to understand.  I'd like to see more from Moebius or at least more from this style of gaming.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30635623', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30635623' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30635623\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30635623' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30635623\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30635623', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30635623_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30635623_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29712394\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Dominitus\/recommended\/264520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"8333582\">Thorn<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI liked the game enough to finish it, but the story is a little slow to move and a few things failed to make sense. Fortunately, though, the puzzles were straightforward and didn't lead to any frustration (I think I had to look up the answer to maybe three over the course of the game). The 3D graphics were a little blocky and people clipped through objects at times, but the 2D environments were generally pretty nicely drawn. Overally I'd give it a 5\/10.

And it is! Very! You might be able to ignore it if you're really determined-- why tho?????-- but as someone who has read considerable slashfic and m\/m romance in her life? Yeah, this is an interactive m\/m thriller you see on Amazon but never can force yourself to buy because ao3 has so much more of it available for free.<br><br>(Also, I was so so certain that this was The Sentinel worldbuilding fused over Stargate: Atlantis characters, but nooo, it's Sherlock BBC characters. Which made me sad, because I never liked Cumberbatch's Sherlock, the dude is far too pissy and mean. But it does explain so much about how unlikable Malachi Rector is at the start, and why he only starts to unclench as soon as he meets his ~Watson~-- who in this case is David Walker.)<br><br>This game is very much a middling adventure game as far as gameplay goes. I had to look up where I was supposed to go three times in the course of my 10+hr run because the next action was obtuse. However, for the puzzles? Eh, they weren't that difficult, which I actually appreciate after the cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that was Dropsy and the &quot;You'll Never Figure Out This Game Because IT! IS! ART!&quot; thing.<br><br>There <i>is<\/i> rampant misogyny here, but I took it as typical misanthropy; I don't expect a socially stunted \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to see anyone in a positive light, men and women alike, so it didn't bother me. Your mileage may vary.<br><br>The character models are hysterical, especially the way their eyes roll around in their head. If I hadn't had the flu as I played I probably would have made a drinking game out of it and gotten rip-roaring drunk as a result.<br><br>So, uh, <b>TL;DR<\/b> gay game is gay but with some flaws, pick it up if you like Jane Jensen and\/or want a game that stands at the edge of the roof of a skyscraper to scream GAAAAAAY out into the wind while there are soulmate AU tones running amuck on the ground.

For me I want an adventure to make me feel like I'm living through the interesting detailed story it's telling me and Moebius does this quite well. <br><br>Now the plot itself is a tad bit laughable but I expect adventures to have B Movie plots. The plots of the much loved Gabriel Knight 1 and 2 were also laughable and somewhat offensive. IE in GB1 the fear of a large black murderous voodoo cult where every black person in the story is involved taps into racist fears that the American population have had and yet again portrays black people in a negative light. <br><br>MILD SPOILER ALERTS: So the plot that reincarnated people of the past are 'chosen ones' and supior aristocratic blood lines wasn't one I warmed to but it worked in a B movie kind of way much like GB1 worked similarly. The way you investigate who is a re-incarnation of who is a kind of cool innovation to.<br><br>The relationship was based on BBCs Sherlock as were the 'analyse' feature where Malachi like Sherlock analyses people at first glance. The relationship between the 2 men and Malachi being a savant is clearly based on this to. The bit were our genius rewires an electrical circuit without first turning the power off wasn't thought through. <br><br>You can see it steals bits from Assassin's Creed in the way it deals with 'destiny'.<br><br>There are strong themes of sexism and mysoginy in the way women are judged throughout the story. Yes I know the writer is a woman, but sometimes women judge other women more harshly. I was also a little uneasy with the middled aged men marrying teenage girls. <br><br>The puzzles are generally logical and nowhere near as nigh on impossible as the puzzles in Gabriel Knight puzzles. I prefer this, some people prefer HARD puzzles though so if this is you maybe this isn't the game for you. <br><br>Graphically I've seen negative comments.

I sort of liked the secondary character, albeit less strongly. I thought the characterisation on these two, especially Malachi, was quite strong. The story, too, was original.<br><br>The concept and story were good, and in terms of creativity, I liked the &quot;brain&quot; function - analysing people before speaking to them. That especially was interesting and innovative.<br><br>Graphics? I liked that aspect. And I don't play adventures for the graphics, anyway.<br><br>Difficulty? Not too hard, actually. Mostly very intuitive.<br><br>My rating? An enjoyable 7.25\/10. I liked it marginally more than Gray Matter, a lot more than some more forgettable games, but not as much as certain classics of the genre.

But it kind of stalls out.  The dialogue is good, too, but the plot line never really comes together in a particularly intriguing way.  The &quot;memory&quot; puzzles, while novel at first, become a bit waring by the end because they never really develop into anything.  In fact, just generally the puzzles never do much.<br><br>I was excited for this because I really enjoyed Cognition immensely, and of course I liked Jane Jensen's Gabriel Knight a lot, but this fell flat for me.  That being said, I thought characters were very well realized and I would visit them again if there were another game in the series.  So, I suppose I will still give it a positive review.  Hopefully too, a new game will be less 90's innuendo about Malachai and his boyfriend's relationship.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26010168', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26010168' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26010168\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26010168' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26010168\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26010168', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26010168_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26010168_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/264520\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 158 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22051556","9836774","11580900","9870916","9833477","21036081","11891569","14314310","22018001","10045935"]}
