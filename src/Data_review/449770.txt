I have not yet beaten the game. I'll try to give an honest mostly non-biased review. Since I have a preference and style of games I like (as I assume everyone does), I will try to push that aside for this review.<br><br>It should be noted that this game wasn't delvoped by a team or company, it was made by one man over the course of a few years. That alone should count for something. But I digress...<br><br>To start, lets talk about the obvious. Yes it looks like crap. The graphics are pretty barren and old. It really does leave much to be desired. But if you judge a game solely on it's looks then you'll miss out on a hell of a lot of treasures! The game shouldn't be played for looks alone.. or at all. The game should be played for the story, much like any RPG.<br><br>The story is good, it's not amazing but it's not trash either. It has a unique perspective and moves at a reasonable pace. There are a few times where I personally felt the story was dragging a bit, but I think the plot unfolds well enough and the over all arch of the story suits the game.<br><br>The characters are unique and indepth. They all have their own personal back stories that helps to understand their motivation and personalities. There is enough substance to the characters that you can either relate with or against them. I have a few favorites when I play, and the nice thing about the game is that I could play with all of my favorite characters in one party. (I don't because most of my favorites are support characters... but I could!)<br><br>The system is interesting... Its out of the norm and that adds to the game play, but I personally feel it was a bit hard to understand and I struggled to pick it up quickly. It took me a while to understand how to do a lot of things in and out of combat, but I also played the majority of the game in beta before there was a tutorial... It's probably much easier to grasp now that there is a tutorial to break it down for you.<br><br>The level of difficulty in the game is pretty rough, I tend to be more of a casual gamer, and I find myself struggling a lot to finish this game. I die constantly and get frustrated when things need to be repeated because I failed at them, or when I have to back track to grind levels out to defeat a boss or quest mob. But a lot of RPGs are grindy, and this one is no exception.<br><br>So to recap:<br><br>Cons:<br>It is not visually appealing<br>The unique system can be hard to pick up and learn quickly<br>It's really hard and requires a lot of grinding (that's what she said?)<br>Some of the story elements felt drawn out or forced<br><br>Pros:<br>The story draws you in<br>It has interesting and fun characters<br>It doesn't have a typical battle system<br>You get a sense of nostalga from playing it<br><br>Overall opinion, I'd recommend this game ONLY to people who really enjoy RPGs and don't mind being ported back to the NES era of gaming. This game isn't for everyone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21627533', 'summary' );

After reading all of the negative comments on the forums from people who haven't even played the game and are judging it based off of the videos... Listen... When you say that the developer put in ZERO effort and just used the stock game engine stuff, you couldn't be more wrong. I've sunk a decent amount of time into RPG Maker and have learned the program, honestly the developer put A LOT more time into this game than what is suggested in the videos. The videos certainly do not do this game justice. The grammar is on point, the dialogue isn't cheesey, and it was not made by a kid. So far, the story seems done well and the events and coding used in the creation of the game is on point. I feel obligated as someone who knows this program and knows what ZERO effort looks like, to make a comment here and set the record straight. I'll add more to my review as I continue to play the game, but at the moment, this game is one of the better RPG Maker games on steam because fundamentally they hit every nail on the head so far. The only thing that is undeniable is that the areas are a little bit lacking in decoration and what not, but that's because they used custom art for a lot of it and obviously had to go a little bit sparingly, especially since it seems that you move on from area to area so quickly, the story keeps you going. Honestly, It feels very old school in approach to the graphics, it's almost nostalgic in a way. So far I'd definitely recommend this game. I just feel bad for the developer because of all of the harsh criticism people have made without even trying it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. You can always try it out for yourself and if you play less than 2 hours it's easy to get a steam refund.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28931713', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28931713' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28931713\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28931713' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28931713\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28931713', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28931713_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28931713_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/recommended\/449770\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">28 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21612035\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"73755312\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5e8992b4780f9640ac25735a2019515f08743272.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5e8992b4780f9640ac25735a2019515f08743272.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5e8992b4780f9640ac25735a2019515f08743272_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73755312\">The Spanish Inquisition<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/games\/?tab=all\">99 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034021040\/recommended\/449770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOKAY. Since two particlular people decided to be angry at my generic review I posted I decided to edit this.<br><br>I beta tested this game starting over a year ago, so I don't have a lot of game time on Steam because I have restarted and played this game multiple times as did several other people.<br><br>I enjoyed this game for what it is. It doesn't have a lot, but it's a 5$ game. If you do all of the side missions and grind like you are suppose to, then you can get a good amount of hours into the game. <br><br>The graphics arent the best from what you can see in the screenshots, but if you look past it I can recommend this game. If you like the retro style RPG type of games then I think you will have fun. The characters I feel are likeable and it has it's silly moments so you get the occasional laugh here and there. The combat gets your gear turning meaning you can't just spam attack every battle. If you do that then it will get you killed. You have a good selection of different characters so you can make some pretty interesting combos if you plan it out right. <br><br>If you can't get past the graphics, don't buy it. If you can, then I would recommend this nice little game to people.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21612035', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21612035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21612035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21612035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21612035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21612035', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21612035_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21612035_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21615849\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maxbyer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"13753623\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2727c793b5f91c8361394d5d96f9757c6738f5a9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2727c793b5f91c8361394d5d96f9757c6738f5a9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2727c793b5f91c8361394d5d96f9757c6738f5a9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maxbyer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"13753623\">Akko<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maxbyer\/games\/?tab=all\">196 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maxbyer\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maxbyer\/recommended\/449770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA lot beneath the surface<br><br>So first and foremost, I do know the dev personally, and I played this game previously from Itch.io. If you wanna call me biased that's fine, but just wanna be open with ya on it.<br><br>I see a lot of posts here about the graphics, and to be quite frank that is the worst part. Locations look NES era FF to me a lot of the time, characters fair better, and monsters can be hit or miss, but some of the designs are pretty original and remind me of things out of Earthbound. Everyone's first impressions are going to be from the screenshots here, but personally I found a lot of enjoyment to thisgame and wouldn't judge a book by its cover alone.<br><br>The stamina system in the gameplay really encouraged me to push out further and further while grinding as I built up meter to pull off my abilities, rather than in other RPGs where I'd stay close to home and return to town to refill my HP and MP constantly. There's definitely a risk reward to this system though as you might run into something that completely wrecks you if you go too far out unprepared. That combined with a system of titles that worked similar to FFX to customize how each party member gains meter kept me fine tuning my party. Which also you get a lot of characters as you go with different skill sets so you can really customize things a great deal. <br>I also really enjoyed other little touches to the world. I found a lot of npc dialogue to be pretty humorous, and loved that there was both a journal and party dialogue that could help you in the right direction when you're out exploring the massive world map, or haven't played ina while and lost track of what you were doing (this is a big one for me XD) Oh! There's also a crafting system which was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Also the music is pretty snazzy, i believe that was done by someone else for the title, but I can't recall.<br><br>Anyway I'd give it a 3.5 or 4 out of 5. Visually it's a mixed bag, but the gameplay and writing are both great IMO. It gives me the feel of playing an old school rpg (which it should) but with enough changes to the game to keep things interesting and from simply being some knock off Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest. <br><br>Also wasn't sure what it'd be sold at on steam but 6 dollars is a pretty darn good rate for the amount of content you find here. So seriously, give this one a shot.<br><br>EDIT: As mentioned above I played a non steam version of this game. While I have purchased it on here, I have just barely started it in case of any technical differences.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21615849', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21615849' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21615849\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21615849' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21615849\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21615849', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21615849_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21615849_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/449770\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["21627533","22536658","28931713","21612035","21615849"]}
