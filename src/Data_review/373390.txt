Takes between 5-10 hours to complete and see everything (depends if you are stuck or not and if your are compulsive enough to talk to every characters about every clues). Charming and memorable characters with good acting, mostly serious but there is some hamming to it. A good balance I would say. The main character, the detective Jenks, is like a cross between the 10th Doctor and Columbo. You need to find clues and interrogate people to find contradictions (lies) in their statements, because of course it's a murder case and you have until the end of the day to find the culprit(s)! Would rate this a 7.5\/10 (consider it a 6.5\/10 if you can't stand FMVs and a 8\/10 if you are a massive fan of the genre).<br><br>Cons: <br>- the interface is a little bit clunky with some bugs that are not game-breaking (if you can't click on a statement or exit an interview, you need to view again any video, it will debug your cursor). I recommend the mouse interface and not the keyboard one. Don't bother with a controller.<br>- the save function is not well implemented (no auto-save and when you save it is not always apparent that it worked, but for me it worked 100% of the time). Don't forget to save manually. You only have 2 slots to save though.<br>- the game windows launch offscreen and you don't have settings about it, but the fullscreen works, so it's more of a nitpick really.<br>For a very small budget title, these flaws are understandable.<br><br>Pros:<br>- No moon logic. For the most part, it's easy to advance in the game and it's probably impossible to get permanently stuck. The game is generous with the tips.<br>- the main gameplay element, finding the contradictions, is really satisfying. You will feel like a badass when you will find the less obvious ones. There is a way to &quot;cheat&quot; if you are stuck or, well, you could always check a guide on the Internet but it's really not necessary.<br>- the intrigue is good enough, you won't get bore.<br>- gorgeous and real visuals (it's full FMV, no distracting computer rendered backgrounds and effects)<br>- the acting is definitively top notch for an FMV game, just don't expect any Oscar-worthy performances. <br>- my computer is old and it runs very smoothly on it. Loading time is minimal and transitions between locations are shorts and realistic (it's a rare occurence in FMV). The map system is also a great way to navigate more quickly between locations.<br><br>Neutrals:<br>- the ending. It feels rushed but at the same time it's a great setting for a sequel. A lot of red herrings and loose ends could be explored, but the lore is interesting enough on its own even for a sequel  with minimal ties with the first game.<br>- we have a good chance to get a sequel (neutral because expectations will be way higher for the sequel)<br>- the music: it is good enough but lacks variety and it is a tad too loud compare to the voice acting for my taste.<br>- there is no cross-examination between multiple characters' statements, only between two statements of the same character. It makes for a simple and focused game, but a lot of waste potential too. Should definitively be a part of a sequel.<br>- the game don't overstay its welcome but at the same time can feel a bit too short especially because of the ending. IMO, it feels like the production runs out of time\/money to make the ending they wanted to initially. It's still great though.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30434463', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30434463' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30434463\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30434463' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30434463\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30434463', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30434463_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30434463_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30342695\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084299123\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"124033395\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084299123\/\" data-miniprofile=\"124033395\">zbgaber<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084299123\/games\/?tab=all\">33 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084299123\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084299123\/recommended\/373390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the credits, the game's developers write that it was an &quot;experiment&quot;.  And it clearly shows.  Some aspects of this game (writing, acting, atmosphere, the mystery until the very end where it just falls apart) are superb.  However, other aspects are very poor.  Setting aside some technical matters with the game (I view this game more as an interactive movie than a game per se so I give it a pass on the simplistic interface), I feel that this game had severe problems in the development of the plot.  The writers often seem to have trouble in finding ways to move the plot forward naturally - often the inspector just something on the ground (I can recall three keychains or fobs that people just seem to drop for no reason for the inspector to find).  Then are moments that pull you out of the game, when the main character's behavior is simply bizarre and unnatural.  This was particularly the case in matters involving police investigation methods (he frequently behaves more like a burgler than an investigator) or in how he responds to threats of violence to himself or others (shrugging and acting exasperated instead of calling in armed backup to arrest everyone in sight). And the conclusion was very disappointing.  It might have been meant as a twist, but you spend 90% of the game investigating strands in direction X and it turns out in the last interview that actually it was direction Y and the guilty party just confesses for no apparent reason.  Still, for the price I enjoyed my time with the game and have no regrets in purchasing it.  The acting and writing were frequently very good.  I hope the developers try again and that their next experiment goes better.

Dodger's playthrough of it, and it's an interesting game if perhaps leaving a lot of decision making out of the equation at times (such as non-interactive cutscenes that could have been timed puzzles\/QTEs) and you can't accuse\/arrest the wrong person, which I add only for completion as that may or may not be important to you as a player.<br><br>I appreciate the HD video, but at times not the acting which can range from being (unintentionally?) comical (especially the player character Inspector Jenks, who also perhaps got his dress sense cues from McCloud rather than Morse, which I find to be diverting) and then the acting being ineffectua throughl to playing the scenes straight. The story is okay, but could have been solved almost immediately with the all-important clue being blatantly obvious and yet the option to compare and contrast the statements given yielded no results.  Not until the final in-game hour anyway.<br><br>Then there are the elements of a paranormal\/horror plot, which sadly was only touched upon and could have made this much more of a game. More than likely the budget constraints put paid to developing that plot, but at least there were little touches in the form of short scenes informing the player of potential events (one I recall being optional, that being the scene in the Reading Room where you're told to go away because &quot;we're about to start a session&quot;).<br><br>As it stands, I achieved a 96% completion rate by the end of the game. This says to me that there is a way to solve another murder mystery that crops up, but there isn't any warning box\/prompt before selecting the option that ends the game.<br><br>You cannot fail to get the murderer of the student that Inspector Jenks is investigating the death of, which for me makes the whole experience feel more like a guided tour that you unlock pieces of if you compare the right choices, but that's it. If Contradiction had much more of a budget? Then we could have had a potential Tex Murphy-esque game to play, but right now I can only recommend this to those who don't want to wait for the aforementioned (or any other) Let's Play to be completed or as a party game given that \u00a36.99 is a fair enough price and I got some enjoyment out of it with about 9 hours of play.<br><br>All said and done though, there is potential here and I would like to see the developer take another stab at making a detective adventure game.<br><br>ADDITIONAL: This, as per the game's Steam store page, is perhaps best played with two or more people as opposed to solo like I did. In that case, I'd say it would play out like a Cluedo-esque murder mystery evening. Approaching Contradiction in this manner would, in my view, override any qualms about the acting and improve the experience overall.<br><br>There are some glitches in the form of typos (&quot;North <i>Lane<\/i>&quot; instead of &quot;North <i>Road<\/i>&quot; when outside the pub) and also in the conversation with Rebecca (her name is sometimes spelled as &quot;Rbecca&quot; and a summary statement of hers that should start with &quot;Usually&quot; has been misspelled as &quot;Ususally&quot;, I've preserved the casing for the developer to quickly get to the problem); Steam integration isn't perfect (the Steam overlay and the taking of screenshots isn't possible at this time); when you get to the end of the credits, the &quot;resume&quot; button is available and Jenks acts as though the conversation with the person-in-question ended normally, however the final end credit text is still overlaid on the screen and prevents access to the game's UI (ALT+F4 to the rescue at that point).  Given the developer is <b>very<\/b> quick at updating (again, as per the game's Steam store page), I expect all these will be fixed soon enough.<br><br>I vaguely recall other typos being present, but I can't recall them right now.

actors were seduced by the rise of the interactive movie, with the likes of Mark &quot;Skywalker&quot; Hamil heading up the Wing Commander games and Christopher &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; Walken starring in the 1996 FMV thriller &quot;Ripper&quot;<br><br><br><b>RIP FMV<\/b><br><br>Unfortunately, my love for all things FMV wasn't shared by my peers,  I was in the minority and the FMV trend had almost died away completely by the end of the 90's.<br>This was partly due to the technological limitations of the time.<br>The video was often interlaced or blocky, the frame rates were poor and the amount of space required by the footage used up a huge amount of CD-Rom storage, the game Ripper I mentioned earlier was spread across 6 CD's!<br><br>Many FMV games also suffered from cheesy writing and equally bad acting.<br>&quot;Phoned in&quot; performances were the norm and as such a stigma began to emerge in the media around the whole &quot;interactive movie&quot; genre.<br>This stigma probably had as much to do with the death of the genre as the technical limitations of the 90's, but whatever the reason, the interactive movie died, I mourned its passing and moved on, but now I've discovered a game which has rekindled my interest, a new, modern FMV experience in all its interactive movie gaming glory.<br><br><br><b>The Stage<\/b><br><br>Contradiction: Spot the Liar! to give it its full (and unnecessarily long title) is a &quot;whodunnit&quot; detective adventure set in the sleepy little English village of Edenton.<br><br>Edenton isn't just a stage for the players either, its a character in its own right.<br>From the village pub to the surrounding woodland, all the locations are beautifully realised and tie together to create a charming and peaceful setting, you'll even see the odd Union Jack fluttering in the breeze.<br>This rural tranquillity gives Edenton a charm of its own, it feels like a real location that you'd find if you drove out  into the green and pleasant land that is the English countryside.<br>It's this tranquil charm which makes the recent events in Edenton all the more shocking.<br><br>There's been a suspicious death in the village, a young woman, Kate Vine, has drowned but was it suicide? a terrible accident? or something more sinister?<br>You've got one night to find out, let the investigations begin!<br><br><br><b>The Players<\/b><br><br>You play as Detective Inspector Jenks, an interestingly likeable character with a compelling interview technique which is sure to make you smile, he's also somewhat of a kleptomaniac and has the added side effect of making me want to start wearing a hat.<br><br>As you explore the village you'll come across some equally interesting locals, friends and acquaintances of Kate's all getting on with their lives, each with their own personalities, view of events and secrets to hide.<br>I can't overstate how well written these characters are, without exception everyone you come across feels like a fleshed out and fully realised person, from the landlady at the village pub to the father and son team who run &quot;Atlas&quot; an exclusive business training course which seems to be popular with the local students, they're all engaging and make each interview a pleasure to play through.<br><br><br><b>One Week Later...<\/b><br><br>Jenks arrives in the village of Edenton one week after Kate Vines death, it's a Friday evening, the locals are going about their business and it's your job to snoop through their things and interview them regarding the death.<br><br>Everything in this game is presented through video footage, from the navigation of the village through to the interviews themselves, but more on that later.<br><br>Movement around the village is a simple, go  left, go right affair, each location has its own video loop, there are no static screens here, Edenton is a living, breathing village.<br>Stand by the lakeside and waves will ripple in the light whilst branches move and creak  in the wind, the level of immersion this creates is undeniably impressive.<br><br><br><b>The Questions<\/b><br><br>You'll find yourself searching through locations, finding clues and interviewing the locals.<br>These interviews are the meat of the game, initially you'll only have a couple of &quot;conversation pieces&quot;  to enquire about, the dead girl, Kate Vine and her driving license which was discovered some distance away from her body.<br>Questioning the residents of Edenton quickly opens up your investigative  options as you uncover more information about events leading up to Kate's death and &quot;acquire&quot; items to ask about from your inevitable snooping.<br><br><br><b>The Play<\/b><br><br>It's not just a case of ask everyone about everything you discover either, that's just part of it.<br>You actually need to listen to what people say,<br><br>Who's lying?<br>Who's telling the truth?<br><br>It's listening out for contradictions in characters answers that will help reveal this information.<br><br><br><b>The Lies<\/b><br><br>The actual mechanic of spotting these contradictions is well implemented too.<br>As you question a person, notes of their relevant answers are recorded in your journal.<br>You can go through these notes and if you spot two that contradict each other you can question the person further regarding the holes in their story.<br><br>Why did they lie?<br>What are they hiding?<br><br><br><b>The Lost<\/b><br><br>This game is by no means easy either, you're not going to breeze straight through the story without actually thinking about what people have told you and going through your notes.<br>Having said that, there is a hint system if you find yourself stuck at a dead end.<br>The hints are given by going to the phone box in the village (Jenks is an old school kind of guy and doesn't seem to have a mobile) and calling the police chief who will offer an insight to help get you back on track.<br>If these hints aren't enough there's always the old faithful option of just plain cheating too, but try and avoid it if you can, the satisfaction of catching someone in a lie is what this game is all about.<br><br><br><b>I Spy<\/b><br><br>One thing I wasn't keen on with this game was the snooping investigation mechanic.<br>When you reach a scene with something interesting for you to discover a giant magnifying glass icon appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.<br>Click on it and Jenks will investigate whatever it is that he has spotted at that location.<br>It works fine but I would have enjoyed a little more subtlety here.<br><br>This mechanic is likely a throwback to the titles mobile gaming routes but as a PC gamer the ability to scan your mouse over a location to discover something for yourself would have been more rewarding.<br><br>I'm just being picky though, this didn't tarnish my enjoyment of the game,  it's a just a change that would have added something to what otherwise was an excellent experience.<br><br><br><b>HDTV<\/b><br><br>Visually this game is hard to fault with high quality full motion video throughout.<br>This is an FMV title with the production values of a primetime TV show.<br>From the camera angles to the sets themselves, everything works to draw you into what feels like a real place populated by real people.<br>The sound is equally impressive, with an excellently appropriate musical score to accompany the ambient sounds found at each location.<br>The voice recording itself is generally of a high quality, occasionally you'll...

It was incredible and I was hooked from the start. Not many games can have me playing for 3 hours running and have me feeling like i've only been playing for about half an hour. <br><br>I feel like there isn't a whole lot I can say about this game without spoiling the story to readers so i'm going to structure this review into a few smaller sections explaining the main premise of the game and linking in my opinions\/experience. <br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>Contradiction is an FMV style game. I'll admit though I have never before played an FMV game. I wasn't around during the FMV craze that I heard about. So I am not sure what typical gameplay is like in them type of games. But I can explain how gameplay functions in Contradiction. <br><br>You play as a detective. You are investigating the death of a character named Kate Vine. You do this by exploring the small village and finding the clues along the way. All areas that you explore are real areas and nothing is animated. The clues that you find can be used to interogate other characters that you meet accross the way. After asking all the questions to people your goal is to spot who is lieing. You have to put two responses together that disagree with each other and then interogate the person more about this Contradiction.<br><br>The game is an investigatory experience. It could be compared to the likes of L.A NOIRE or Sherlock Holmes. But Contradiction decides to strip it's core mechanics down to the basics. They decide to focus on the questioning mechanic. The responses are well thought out and it is very enjoyable to listen to what the characters have to say. You often find yourself linking replies that you got right at the start of the game to ones that were said very late in the game. This means you need to have a good memory or else you could find yourself having to look through pages of replies. Although boy is it satisfying when you finally find a contradiction amongst all of the replies. <br><br><b>The UI<\/b><br>Now this game is controlled entirely with the keyboard. The UI is key to making sure the experience is fun. It does this well to an extent. The initial controls the game gives you are horrible. You probably want to rebind them to more appropriate keys as soon as you start playing. Although even navigating the controls screen isn't great. There is no way that I could see to just rebind one single key. You have to go through the entire list and rebind each key instead of just picking one. What I would like to see is the introduction of mouse control, even if it was just across the main menu. It would definitely make the experience a bit better. <br><br>Then you have the map. Initially it is kinda confusing to use. You have 2 choices of how to explore. You can use the map and go to a location straight away using that. But you can only use the keyboard to control it again. Originally I didn't realize you could use the map for movement because I was trying to use the mouse to click on the location. But once you realize that you can then it is a much better form of movement. The second way of navigation is through the arrow keys. You get given a choice of places to go to next from your current location. The problem with this is that the game seems to confusingly decide to change orientation. This means you can't just spam up for example to keep going in that direction. You need to keep an eye on what direction orientation the world has randomly decided to go to. This factor confused me for quite a while and made me go in the wrong direction numerous times. But I did get used to it in the end. <br><br><b>The Characters<\/b><br>So each character is played by a real life person including the person you play as. The character development throughout the game is great. Your really do get to know the characters which is key in an investigatory game where your main focus is to spot the criminal. Some of the acting is vastly exagorated, especially Jenks(Your own character). But this is OK I think because it makes sure you don't miss anything but sometimes it is a little bit cringeworthy. <br><br>Some characters in contradiction I felt were amazing actors and definitely gave their characters a personalilty. To name a few the characters of Ryan, James and Simon were played excelently and I want to take the time to praise their actors. Obviously the rest of the other actors were also great as well. But there were some moments were I felt the acting was kinda bad. I have to wonder if it was the bad dialog that the script writers had given them that made these moments cringeworthy. But the majority of the dialog and acting was amazing and I definitely enjoyed it. <br><br><b>Summary<\/b><br>So would I recommend Contradiction. YES, YES, Oh boy yes. It was an incredible experience the likes of which I personally havn't seen before. If you love detective games this is definitely the game for you. It sees the detective experience from a different perspective that isn't usually focused on in games. The game ends gearing up for a sequel. But they need peoples support on this game if they are to make another game. I really hope this game succeeds because I would love to play another game of this and experience some more backstory behind the characters. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Especially at the very reasonable price point of \u00a36.99. It is a bargain for how much fun you get out of it. It took me 8 hours to complete which is well worth the price.<br><br><b>TheIronicGamers rating system<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Don't ever buy this game. <br><\/li><li>Maybe consider it on a sale. <br><\/li><li>An average game.<br><\/li><li>A good game that should definitely be considered.<br><\/li><li><b><u>A must play!<\/u><\/b><\/li><\/ul><br>Disclaimer: I was given a early press key by the developer to make this review.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17068564', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17068564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17068564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17068564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17068564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17068564', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17068564_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17068564_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 45 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17151963\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NTylerWeTrust\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"102404698\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/21\/21fa3bcd4fbb26ac6b06d5c849f337638e9e8c0b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/21\/21fa3bcd4fbb26ac6b06d5c849f337638e9e8c0b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/21\/21fa3bcd4fbb26ac6b06d5c849f337638e9e8c0b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NTylerWeTrust\/\" data-miniprofile=\"102404698\">NTylerWeTrust<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NTylerWeTrust\/games\/?tab=all\">383 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NTylerWeTrust\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NTylerWeTrust\/recommended\/373390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI can't honestly describe how much I love and adore this game.

In no way I'm saying that the game is bad, its that the quality and tone rides a very thin line and frankly balances perfectly.<br><br>I highly recommend this game, whether to just support the developer so that similar efforts can me made, or if you are looking for a murder mystery with a lot of camp and charm nailed in around the framework. <br><br>Suggestion to the developer for a sequel, retain as much of the cast as possible, just create a new mystery for Jenks to solve with eerily similar characters.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17151963', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17151963' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17151963\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17151963' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17151963\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17151963', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17151963_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17151963_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17097469\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">AestheticGamer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/games\/?tab=all\">5,088 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/\">72 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/373390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tContradiction is a live-action FMV Murder-Mystery game. You play as Inspector Jenks, a British Policeman who goes to investigate the death of a girl named Katie in a small outskirt village. Her death was investigated and called a suicide, but there was morphine in her blood at her time of death and her driver's license was pinned to a tree in the forest away from the scene of her death, leading our character to suspect there's more involved in this case which he takes personal interest in. His work quickly leads him to find there is indeed something going on in this town...<br><br>So, like many FMV games, this game does have an edge of B-charm, laugh-out-loud moments, a lot of this comes from some of the acting and facial expressions the actors can have in specific scenes. But that's not to say this is a so-bad-it's-good type of game, in fact the opposite, it actually got kind of gripping as it developed and in contrast some moments were acted out rather well. It's got a multi-layered mystery that gets deeper and deeper as the night goes on, and is actually surprisingly interesting.<br><br>Gameplay is rather basic. You walk around a town and look for clues hidden about, and people to interview. When you interview people, you take out clues, both physical and conversation topics you earn from talking to others, and watch FMV scenes as they interact. When the scene is done, your character has taken 'notes' to the key points of the discussion. You then can take the key notes from that discussion, and every other discussion you've had with that character, and try and spot any 'contradictions' the character may have said. If you find a contradicting point, it triggers another scene, which either will lead to you having to do further digging or creates a new conversation topic you can raise up to others. Other conversation topics can be found around as objects or weird things in town that strike up a good conversation topic, and some rare objects found can be used to explore deeper certain areas in the village.<br><br>The game has a solid cast of something like 10 main characters, and is backed by some rather good-quality video for the backgrounds, FMV scenes, etc., and an actually pretty wonderful soundtrack. Music added a lot to specific scenes, and there were a few moments without music where you can hear the atmosphere sounds and drone noises that made some scenes legitimately creepy. On that, while the game is down-toned most of the time, there's the odd scene that plays every once in a while that can catch you off-guard, something that's just kind of creepy, or unexpected, shocking in some cases. I won't spoil anything with that, but the game has a few sudden scenes that happen as you investigate that might catch you off-guard.<br><br>It's got a few minor flaws. There are a few times where something the character said was obviously a lie or a contradiction to something you already knew, but because you didn't have the 'conversation topic' piece, you couldn't accuse them of this. A few contradictions (or what seem like contradictions) the game doesn't think quite are. Also the game, while it does have an ending and wraps up the case, proposes more questions, especially near the very end, and has several loose plot threads. They seem to be a sequel hook, and past the game credits a message pops-up confirms this saying  &quot;Thanks For Playing!&quot;, they'd like to make a sequel, but the only way to do so is for the game to do well-enough, and they appreciate reviews\/videos\/the like on their project.<br><br>So that raises the question, &quot;Is it worth it?&quot; To which I say, for me, absolutely so. I liked it, I enjoyed it. There were a few moments I got stumped on what to do (get too stuck and you can use a cheat system to tell you what to do next, a feature I never used, or call your chief for a vague general hint) and as you collect more clues you're given maybe too many conversation points to look over, but I actually ended up enjoying the mystery that unveiled in the game, the loose plot threads interest me to see continued, and the story had some fun twists and turns, was sometimes unintentionally amusing, but other times more consciously so, and was gripping at times. Worth it if an FMV Murder-Mystery sounds up your alley, and want something between hammy entertainment and something more gripping and interesting. Hope to see this world revisited in the future.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17097469', 'summary' );

It's FMV, but it's well done.  The puzzles are almost all conversation based, and involve paying attention to what people are saying.  Of course the game gives you quite detailed notes about the major points that each person you interview says, which makes finding their contradictions a reasonable task instead of an impossible one. <br><br>More importantly, the puzzles almost all make sense.  Only maybe one of them, I think, was kind of out there.  For a game like this, only one is a pretty big achievement. <br><br>I absolutely loved the acting, as well.  The main character is goofy in the best possible way.  The character himself is serious, but the acting is just . . . perfectly goofy.  I don't know how to describe it.  Watch the intro sequence and you'll see what I mean.  <br><br>Overall for a game developed on a budget, it's extremely well done.  Probably the best FMV game I've played outside of the Tex Murphy series, and a lot of the reason I'd put them above this one is just because there's more to them.  This is an 8-10 hour experience at most, probably, and it left me wanting a lot more at the end.  If this were the first chapter in a series of games, I'd buy the rest in a second.<br><br>Highly recommended.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30851347', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30851347' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30851347\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30851347' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30851347\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30851347', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30851347_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30851347_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30794914\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ArseneLupinGentlemanThief\/recommended\/373390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"108673286\">The Shadow Commander<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 1.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinitely a breath of fresh air.
