I just don't think people should bother playing it on Steam for a few reasons.  As far as I know, you cannot link your account from the official Royal Quest forums to your Steam account.  Which means you need to download the game all over again if you want to use the free promotional stuff.  Or even talk on their forums, because you have to pick a character you have created in the game to give your profile an actual name (instead of the generic one you are given when you create an account) or to actually post anything at all on their forum.<\/span> <b>Edit: Was told how to link Steam account &amp; take advantage of the premium service they are giving out for a limited time.  <br><br>Thank you very much to <div class=\"bb_h1\">Enya<\/div> for helping me to understand how to do this.<\/b>  <br><br>Another issue I have is the camera does not follow the character around very well at all.  It can be disorienting and frustrating having to constantly move it around, even after having ticked the option in the menu to make the camera follow you.  It slides very slowly around your character while you move around, and doesn't look good or act very well at all.<br><br>You have no option to move with W,A,S,D keys.  Only the mouse.  It's not a a deal breaker for me, personally.  But I would rather be able to move with the keys then having to hold the mouse down all the time or clicking from one spot to another.  Plus with how wonky the camera is, it just adds to the over all feeling of frustration with this game.<br><br>It gives you tips and guides you, but it doesn't.  You have a tutorial you can go through to understand things a little better, but it doesn't really explain everything.  Like, everything you pick up says LOOT.  Well duh it's loot.  Everything is loot in a game like this.  That is like if you went into a bakery and every item was simply labeled &quot;BAKED&quot;.  Then there's a LOOT tab and a crafting tab.  But every single thing I pick up (be it something a mob dropped or something I harvest) says it can be used for crafting but it doesn't go in the crafting tab!  That makes no sense to me and I end up selling everything very confused.  A lot of times when I go to sell something the vendor tells me the item is very expensive but they can't give me the amount it is actually worth and that just confuses me even further.<br><br>Besides these things, it really is an ok game.  A little too grindy for my tastes though, as literally every quest is either kill X amount or collect this amount of these things (either something a mob drops or something you gather from the environment).  <br><br>It's a good looking game with relaxing music.  You can left-click on your map to sort of auto-run to quest givers or whatever.  I just wish it wasn't so grindy and with such frustrating moevment and awful camera.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30514101', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30514101' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30514101\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30514101' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30514101\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30514101', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30514101_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30514101_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t158 of 214 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">19 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>10 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12256673\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"22283275\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb3a60a3484d736311e4570d423a62179c0549d2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb3a60a3484d736311e4570d423a62179c0549d2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb3a60a3484d736311e4570d423a62179c0549d2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/\" data-miniprofile=\"22283275\">CoporateFatCat<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/games\/?tab=all\">713 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFattestCoporateCat\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1,973.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 27, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor all those calling this P2W you need to quit reviewing F2P games, you have no clue how F2P works. Every MMO F2P game has microtransactions. Someone has to pay for server upkeep and development, in short no F2P MMO will ever be truly free.<br><br>The upper hand Royal Quest has over it's competitors is that over 95% of what can be bought with cash can also be sold in the in game market for gold. Collecting gold in game is also very easy for players who do not want to pay any cash into the game. Even the cash shop currency can be sold. So it gives no advantage to any players that prefer to buy cash shop items.<br><br>This is actually a great game and THE MOST BALANCED F2P with cash shop items I have ever played and I have played them all, literally. I am sick of the all the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 poor reviews of games by players who don't have enough knowledge into said game to give it an factual review. <br><br>So let's clear up some of these misconceptions already put out there for this particular game:<br><br>1. Bag space. Your bag upon starting is split into 5 sections with 14 spaces each, that is 70 slots total. I've played plenty of &quot;F2P&quot; MMORPG's with less.<br><br>2. There is no forced PVP Zones. You can choose to follow your open world quests and grind or you can join the sandbox PVP zone for boosted EXP points.<br><br>3. EVERYTHING except the market currency can be bought at different NPC's, INCLUDING CASH SHOP ITEMS AND MOUNTS FOR IN GAME CURRENCY! One of the best mounts in the game cannot even be bought, it has to be unlocked with quest items. You don't have to buy these items just from players. Cash shop currency can be bought through the auction house . And they have included a maximum\/minimum cap on how much a player can charge for cash shop currency. This is to fight gold farming companies. IN WHICH CASE NO OTHER &quot;F2P&quot; game has ever initiated a limiting system like this and has actually done very well for this game. You won't ever go into town seeing shouts of &quot;Golds 200k=9.00 US @ <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/royalquestgolds.com&quot;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >royalquestgolds.com&quot;<\/a> or some garbage along those lines.<br><br>4. You don't have to pay anything to get in as some other review has mentioned.<br><br>5. Another reviewer had mentioned getting constantly killed by another player with OP cash shop gear. You cannot buy gear in the cash shop for this game. You cannot buy the ingredients in the cash shop to craft gear. This RPG much like every other RPG is heavily character build based. I haven't purchased **** since I first started playing and was already dropping characters 10 levels higher in the PVP zone in the most basic gear I could pick up. Also in which case PVP zones are limited by levels also so no getting into battles at level 13 with level 47 characters. PVP Zones are level designated &amp; only allow a 10 level difference.<br> <br>6. Now with the newest update all classes are about balanced in PVP. The crusader for a time there was a tad bit horrible but the new update has fixed that.<br><br>7. No kill stealing, no powerleveling. Everyone who hits an enemy will gain their proper share of exp from it. Even if you are not partied with that\/those other person\/people. However who ever does the most total damage will get the loot. All characters in a party with the exception of PVP zones, since parties can get split up in the zone, must hit the targets to get exp from it. No letting another character stand aside gaining EXP while a higher level character decimates the battlefield. Each person must attack to get their exp share. Again another way to combat gold farms &amp; their services. In the PVP zones however, you will get exp from ally kills no matter where you are and the total end exp when you leave the zone is what you truly get, it is not split up dismally between the party when you leave. What you see is what you  get.<br><br>8. All mobs that can aggro will be aggro'd. A system in Royal Quest needed in most MMORPG's to eliminate people's needs for vacuum hacking. If you run past 20 aggro set monsters in Royal Quest you will pull 20 aggro set monsters. At that point it's fight or flight. Which can make for some interesting save-your-***-moments. Had another character try &amp;  run past me pulling roughly 10 monsters, he ended up dying right next to me and in an instant they were set on me.<br><br>9. There is no such thing as junk in Royal Quest. Everything you pick up can and will be used for crafting something or commission(repeatable) quests which give Exp\/gold\/items sometimes all 3 and a few of them give a cash shop item. Even not so great gear can be broken down for crafting materials. Which makes making money in the game so easy. There is always somebody looking for what you have. And as I had mentioned earler more than 95% of cash shop items are sellable in the market. There really is no upper hand for cash users, unless you think that NO bonus stat costume is giving the player at the controls an ego boost...(At this time there are only 4 total pieces of costumes\/pets\/decorations that give bonus stats, which are horrible compared to the stats you can get from crafting normally).<br><br>10. Fair level up system for those of us who work. Your character gains 2x exp points when you are offline resting. The exp amount is dependant on your character level. Fetch, kill and collect quests are pretty fair in ratio at each level. So for collect quests which take the most time you can grind for a little bit, collect the money then buy the necessary collection items in the market\/auction house.<br><br>It is your standard point &amp; click, press skill button, type of game. Lightweight on processor and graphic usage. For those that prefer WASD movement like myself...as someone else had mentioned, the point and click system absolutely sucks. Because of this, I would compare this game to a cross between point &amp; click ease of Diablo, skill system of Dekaron, and speed of Dragon Nest (When you get into higher levels of course). Some AoE's have a targeting system similiar to that of Wildstar. Camera movement is very Diablo-esque, which can also be annoying sometimes. This game could also use a better guide on how to obtain certain types of currency in game for specific NPC's, and NO, none of this special currency cannot be bought in the cash shop.<br><br> HOWEVER, ONE WARNING: This game has been in open beta for over 2 years now(Yeah, I know that is rather ridcilulous.). So be prepared for major changes that could be postive or negative.<br><br>Update as of 07-24-16<br> I can no longer recommend this game due to it's unchanged model &amp; extremely slow updates I have moved on to Eloa (Hosted by Webzen), Devilian (Hosted by Trion), &amp; HeroWarZ (Hosted by Kog Games). These 3 games are much better 2.5D games. <br><br> Eloa being the most similiar to RQ but with much more content and much less push for Cash Shop items. Also Eloa uses a unique &quot;Stance&quot; system that allows certain skills &amp; weapons in certain stances for each class. As well as your pets help combat enemies in the realm. Even better WSAD or Click to move are options. Sadly this is not a suite (Steam, Arc, Origin, Aeria Ignite) game, so the population is not great at this point.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

P2W (Pay to Win)<br><b>ANSWER<\/b>: The short answer is NO, however, let me go in depth with this...<br><br>When you start this game you get 3 days free premium this gives you:<br><br>+50% EXPERIENCE AND DROP RATE<br><br>PORTAL SKILL (This allows you to save 5 places and teleport to it at any time including Maidens (Rogues\/Assassin\/Thief get a skill called Secret Lair which allows you to save only one spot but its free!)).<br><br>FREE TELEPORTATION BETWEEN MAIDENS (Even without premium it doesn't cost that much)<br><br>+10 QUESTS IN QUEST LOG (I have never needed 30 quest slots even at low levels where I had 18 quests at one time, even with dailies (I will go more in depth into the dailies later on).<br><br><b><u>PETS AND MOUNTS<\/u><\/b><br><br>Pets are utility centric as in they do nothing but pick up drops for you they do require you buy SIlver\/Gold Magnet Collars from Cash Shop, they have a durability called Charge, 1 Charge = 1 drop picked up (Pets are not worth the trouble having other than aesthetics you can easily just pick up the drops yourself with spacebar).<br><br>Mounts again are utility centric they offer increased movespeed as well as various stat boost such as attack or health, they require Mount Feed from Cash Shop, Crusader\/Dark Knight can get Mounts that do not require food for 300G from Ricker in Varlone City he is in the centre square off to the top right and from Ronda in Iris out of the South Gate of Varlone, these Mounts only give movespeed bonus (Mounts are semi useful for all classes as the buffs from them last for 1 hour even if you dismount, only the classes I mentioned can do mounted combat). You can also use Grass Chewing Gum which gives you 20% Runspeed for 15 minutes, you can get it from a daily quest or dropped from monsters (its rare to get a drop), you can also buy it from the Market fairly cheap.<br><br>A Mount and a Pet can be bought from an NPC (Head of the Merchant Guild) to the south of city square in Varlone City.<br><br>Reales can be bought from Market for 10-14k gold per Reale, 10x Mount Feed is 29 Reales and last for 1 hour each (290-406k for 10 hours of extra buffs, which you totally dont need if you are just PVMing although it would be useful), Silver Collar 2000 Charge is the same 29 Reales. You can get 100x Mount Feed for 269 Reales and Gold Collar 9000 Charge for 99 Reales. This is on the EU Maragorne Server.<br><br><b><u>BAGS AND WAREHOUSE<\/u><\/b><br><br>You have 14 slots for each type of item they are split into Equipment, Expendables, Loot and Crafting Items. You can store excess\/rare items in your Warehouse which has 27 slots available accessible at any Maiden. The 2 Bags that get full fairly quickly are Expendables and Loot but once you learn what you should keep and what should be sold to NPC or put on the Market you won't have too many bag problems.<br><br><b><u>EQUIPMENT, ITEM IMPROVEMENT AND SEALING<\/u><\/b><br><br>ALL Equipment in the game can either be bought from NPCs, Crafted, Dropped from Monsters, Found in Dungeons (Marked by a Cross Shaped Grave Stone with Blue particle effects, these are mostly personal so you will not be able to sell them on the Market) or bought from Players via the Market.<br><br>Item improvement is done through Alchemists you will know the NPC is an Alchemist because they will have an Alchemical Cauldron next to them which is used to craft recipes. Philosopher Stone Chips are used to upgrade C Class Equipments only, Philosopher Stone Shards are used to upgrade B and A Class Equipments. Ashkalot Cubes can be used to upgrade any item while reducing its cost and protecting it from breaking (there is a daily to get these cubes), Cash Shop items can help in your upgrading but if you start using those before level 40 you are just wasting your money.<br><br>Sealing is EXPENSIVE, this allows your equipment to gain extra stats quality of seal is as follows from worst to best Green\/Blue\/Purple\/Orange. Emeralds are used to seal C Class Equipments, Sapphires for B Class Equipments and Morions for A Class Equipments. Crystal Vessels can be obtained through a daily quest, this item can be used to grant you Blood Crystal which can be used to place a new seal on an already sealed item (The current seal will be DELETED and a NEW seal put on). Emerald, Sapphire, Morion and Crystal Vessels can be purchased from Master of Enchantment outside of Academy of Magic Varlone City bottom right of map. Cash Shop items only help to alter the seals already on the equipment or to allow the lowest quality of Blue to be added.<br><br><b><u>DAILIES AND X2 EXPERIENCE<\/u><\/b><br><br>There will be many dailies but the two worth mentioning are Caustic Acid (This nets you 3 Ashkolot Cubes for 50 Caustic Acid) and Green Slime (This nets you 2 Crystal Vessels for 50 Green Slimes), you can take these quests soon after you hit level 20 from the Message Board in Varlone City centre to the bottom right. You can also get a free Emerald along with 2 Potions from Protecting the Vegetable Garden from Pests taken from Connor Barr in Elgore. You can bring up available quests by hitting the M or Q key and clicking the Available Quests tab top right (You will need to bring up the map and click this tab and quest to see where to go for it each time you lose your way).<br><br>You will gain resting bonus experience if you are not on your character for more than 8 hours to a max of 20 hours this works on all quests and monsters you gain experience from will be doubled till it is depleted.<br><br><b><u>BELLA THE RARITY BUYER AND SELLA THE COLLECTOR<\/u><\/b><br><br>Cards are rare drops from monsters which can be given to Bella for Insignia's of Distinction or sold on the Market. Various items can be bought from Sella for Insignia's of Distinction including PREMIUM TIME as well as a few things that can be bought in Cash Shop which includes Decorations that give +5% Health. They are both located in centre court of Varlone City to the northwest. You can also gain Insignia's of Distinction by PVPing in PVM\/PVP areas Rewards are given monthly and you must be in the top 20 PVPers.<br><br><b><u>CRAFTING<\/u><\/b><br><br>Most loots are used for crafting, C Class Equipments are 100%, B Class 80% and A Class 60%. Flax is important in crafting you find this randomly by digging up plants. Ores are also found scattered around areas and as you progress through the game you will find the higher quality ores, digging ores also gets you Anthricite. Elum is obtained through Equipment that you put in the Splitter, the higher level the Equipment the more Elum you will get, Red Elum comes from Weapons, Blue Elum comes from Clothing (Armor, Headgear etc), Green Elum comes from Accessories (Rings, Amulets etc). So keep those Equipment drops! if you plan on crafting (Crafting gets you personal gear with slots, the same as Dungeons). WARNING keep all Gem drops if you do plan on crafting as they drop rarely and are used in recipes at high levels. Some Crafting Recipes can be bought from NPCs inside of PVM\/PVP areas, they require you gather Elenium nodes which will give you Alchemical Runes with which to buy the Recipes. Recipes also drop from monsters. You can find all the machines necessary for crafting\/splitting at the east side of Varlone City, SPECIAL NOTE the Elenium Converter requires Alchemical Runes to change 1 material to another.<br><br><b><u>PVP FIGHTING ARENA<\/u><\/b><br><br>Pushing A on your keyboard brings up a Menu with Battleground, Arena and Store (in the Center, Blue button), You can join Arena 5 times a day to earn Blood Tokens which in turn can be used to buy from the Arena Store to improve your prowess vs other players, there is also a Mount and Pet as well as various potions.<br><br>To conclude the game is beautiful the music is great and I enjoy playing it for free.<br><br>I hope you found this Review(Guide) informative and insightful.<br><br>Go here for more!<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/eu.royalquest.com\/forum\/index.php?\/topic\/137-all-about-rq-and-more-steam-review-included\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >All about RQ and MORE!<\/a><br><br>HAPPY RQing!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11999459', 'summary' );

The art design and monster models are often very creative. I'm enjoying this game more than I thought I would. I also really enjoy the isometric top-down view. Otherwise it is pretty standard fantasy RPG fare. But I like that just fine.<br><br>Also, the F2P features aren't so bad. You can buy the store currency with the in-game gold you earn by playing. I haven't found that there is too much the pay store offers that you can't do without anyway. The mounts are a bit overly costly to maintain, but aren't all that much faster than walking anyway. Bag storage is a pain, and too expensive to expand much, but stores are abundently available for shedding a filled up inventory. I'm not finding it too bothersome ...yet.<br><br>I recommend giving the game a try. If it's not for you, so be it.

You can buy premium currency with gold. Second off, most of the people who are bad mouthing the game either have very low hours played (under 5) or got their \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 rocked in PVP (Which is entirely optional)<br><br>It feels alot like Ragnarok Online but with better graphics and animations. There are also far more skills than Ragnarok.<br>The leveling is slow, but the game isn't all about leveling. Anyway, here's a Pro\/Con list.<br><br>PROS<br><br>Decent, fluid graphics<br>Fun gameplay<br>You can buy any premium item with gold.<br>There's PVP (That is instanced so you don't have to PVP)<br>Lots of class diversity<br>Daily quests for faster leveling<br>Card system to upgrade gear (Apply poison\/fire\/etc or extra damage to weapons\/gear)<br>You can buy premium items with in game currency from other players<br>You can buy premium account time from other players with in game currency<br>You can set up shops<br><br>CONS<br><br>Sometimes the grammar is a little bit off, nothing major.<br>The upgrade system is based on a % chance so after +5 it fails alot<br>The debuff from dieng lasts a little while<br><br>Overall, it's a great game that I'm having lots of fun with.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11845321', 'summary' );

this game is NOT pay to win, in ANY way.  <br><br>Everything in the game, yes, EVERYTHING, can be purchased with gold. If somoene buys an item with real money, they can sell it for in game gold, and people frequently do.  This is one of the best systems of any free to play ive ever seen.  If you dont feel like spending 5$ to get a &quot;real money&quot; item, just wait til someone else buys it and sells it.  You can just get enough in game gold to buy it off them when you want!<br><br>I could continue, going on and on about the game in paragraph form, but ill simply list the Pros and Cons.<br><br>PROS:<br><br>- Fantastic Music<br>- Responsive\/noncomplicated UI<br>- Veried Environments and Enemies<br>- Varied Missions and mission rewards<br>- Tons of weapons, hats, shirts, pants, shoes, etc; all with unique stats<br>- Gear Upgrading system. (Find a reall nice piece of gear? Upgrade it and make it better!)<br>- Lack of Pay-to-Win Elements<br>- Devs are active! They do announcements in game, as well as work on updates, and help players who are having issues.<br>- Fantastic community. If youre a new player, 99% of the community will answer any question you have and try to help you along the way!<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>CONS:<br><br>- Occasional bugs, but nothing major<br>- Bag size is relatively small to start with (this can be expanded at any time)<br>- Some Quests have you running across large portions of the map, and you move slowly at first (better gear can fix this &quot;problem&quot;)<br>- Game is still in Beta. (This will obviously change, leading up to the full release)<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Honestly I only made this review because the current top rated reviews for the game are completely inaccurate.  Most of the people who reviewed the game and then said &quot;PAY TO WIN DONT PLAY IT LOL&quot; are completely wrong.  They invested just enough time to get to about level 15 (not even to the first major choice you make in the game, which branch of your class you want to advance into) and then declared the game unbalanced.<br><br>Not only is this completely false (as i said above, someone can, and people constantly do, buy &quot;real money&quot; currency and sell it on the in game market for gold. You get gold, you buy the real money currency, and you dont have to ever spend a cent on the game) But it gives the game a bad name and bad light.<br><br>I played for about 2 hours and then quit originally, but came back a month or two later and havnt quit playing since.  Once i got past the newbie level stuff, I really began to enjoy the game a lot more.<br><br>I also think its important to mention this is my first MMO.  I literally only play Shooters besides this game, and I usually hate games like this.  It takes something special to make a hardcore CSGO fan enjoy a top down-esque MMO game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14197609', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14197609' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14197609\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14197609' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14197609\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14197609', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14197609_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14197609_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t45 of 70 people (64%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11601439\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"78489926\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f9672cff2e54f025014a49762a55037f2a24c38.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f9672cff2e54f025014a49762a55037f2a24c38.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f9672cff2e54f025014a49762a55037f2a24c38_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/\" data-miniprofile=\"78489926\">Dedepiktas<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/games\/?tab=all\">37 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DedePiktas\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">242.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 8, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo after i played this game for a bit i can tell you few things which might help you decide to play or not .<br><br>First : About p2w Aspect yea you can buy stuff in cash shop mount, bag space , hp potions ,cards well most of stuff which can be obtained from drops but low chance. But here is a thing you can buy cash shop money &quot;reales&quot; with gold from other ppl in the market so you can obtain same stuff just not instantly<br><br>Second : Game is a bit grindy, with ques,t which helps a little but you will grind for items, for craft mats etc but in my opinion its good that you can't get good stuff instantly<br><br>And third : Game has open pvp zones where you go to farm mats for recepies soem quests and other stuff and its free pk zone on all ofc its lvl based you can't get in to lvl 10-19 zone with lvl 20+ char <br><br>So overal i like this game, I played for 200h and still gona play it as its pvp is engaging , there is NONE p2w aspect only pay to be lazy aspect, and the game has a freaking castle wars :D owning a castle is always fun\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11601439', 'summary' );

Keep in mind that you may disagree, and that's fine. I want to start by saying that I have a max rank (Lv. 60) character and a guild I've personally founded by myself. I do love this game, it's very addicting. It's your tradional point and click MMORPG that reminds me a lot of how Vanilla WOW was back in the day difficutly wise.<br><br>You can explore a wide variety of beautiful locations, quest with friends, tinker with whatever build you're making at the time, or just goof off and explore. If you're more of a PVP player the game offers duels with other opponents in safe zones. On top of that you can also compete in Castle Sieges, Arena, and Battleground, all of which are aimed at people who love PVP, as you'll be fighting other well geared opponents. I can say with confidence that you can hit level cap with no Premium and it's not a necessity, though it does make the game easier and a lot more enjoyable. I've given you the good, now I'm going to give you the bad.<br><br>While everything up to level cap isn't pay to win, everything afterwards is. Now don't mob me on my post for saying this, it's true.<br><br>1. To compete with the best players in the server PVP wise, you need great gear. Upgrading gear past a certain point requires very deep pockets as the odds of successful improvent start to go lower and lower, and finally hitting 1% after a certain point. This requires you to buy many Red Stones and Runes of Preservation.<br><br>2. Sealing. Not only is getting the seal you want hard, but then getting the seal you want Orange is outrageous. You must have very deep pockets  to do this with every piece of gear, as well as unbelievable luck.<br><br>3. Cards. If you want Monster Cards you're going to have to put an insane amount of grind in and hope you get super lucky, or buy them off of the market for an insane amount of gold. Some of them aren't that steep while I've seen some go as high as 150 Million Gold.<br><br>So in conclusion, while this game is free to try and it's completely possible to hit lv. cap without paying a single penny, if you plan to stick around and get serious about PVP you're going to be shelling out a good deal of money, or spending many many hours end game grinding for the gold you need. So, maybe not necessarily pay to win, more like pay for convenience. <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24708178', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24708178' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24708178\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24708178' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24708178\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24708178', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24708178_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24708178_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t98 of 166 people (59%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11519965\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75774528\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a8\/a8c10ef46d17f14c0517bf81f06b9c5ec1069fff.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a8\/a8c10ef46d17f14c0517bf81f06b9c5ec1069fff.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a8\/a8c10ef46d17f14c0517bf81f06b9c5ec1069fff_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75774528\">MewmewGirl<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/games\/?tab=all\">389 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MewmewGirl\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">21.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 2, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm sort of confused by some of the negative reviews, as I'm finding this to be a pretty decent game that doesn't have many problems.<br><br>First, it has a lot of lore and story to it.  It's not just quests like &quot;Kill 10 rats because I stubbed my toe and need toe medicine&quot; - the quests have more detail and story to them than that.  Each quest has been pretty detailed so far with lots of extra tidbits of story and lore you can get out of the NPCs if you select to ask them certain questions.<br><br>You also find a lot of NPCs that aren't part of the quest line but that actually have story bits to add if you talk to them.  I find this extra work and detail to help the game to be much more immersive.<br><br>The classes are all very different.  If you don't like the way one plays, you really should try the others as they all have their own different way to play and their own feel.  The powers are all different and specific for each class line and greatly change and affect the way you play.  This isn't like some games where the only difference in classes and skills are that they make a different graphic for them but they play the same way.  Here they all really play in specific unique ways.  Even when two classes have traps, one class they are auto traps and the other are traps you manually detonate.  There are a pretty good amount of skills too and they all have purpose and do different things rather than just being damage upgrades that look a little different.<br><br>The game plays out just fine and quickly.  Yes, your main attack if you click something is set on default to autoattack (like 99.9% of every MMORPG that exists, so why one would complain about that I don't know - especially since you can toggle it off to manual if you really want) but in most classes that attack is very fast and you're going to be worried about using all your skills all through combat.  You quickly end up using a lot of them.  The only class that plays a little slower to start out is the Warrior, but even they end up with a lot of skills in time too.  If you're into melee and want faster combat, play the Rogue.  The Warrior is meant to actually be a party tank and has a lot of taunts and things instead of the fast pace skills of the other classes.  That isn't to say they are lacking, they have quite a few and you'll see them as you level up more.<br><br>The game isn't well known here, so there aren't a lot of people in game right now.  Not only that, but they don't really understand why it's a free game they can't get in (the first week is just for people who buy one of the DLC packs, but they only say that if you go searching elsewhere to find that info and didn't post that here).<br><br>I'm not that into PvP, but for people who are they have these nice castles your guild can take over that spawn chests of loot and have other neat little extras in them.<br><br>I don't really get their whole &quot;PvPvE&quot; thing - that's just a fancy way to say PvP zones.  Most MMORPG games with PvP also have monsters in the same zones but they just call them PvP zones instead of trying to be fancy with the wording.  I really very much dislike PvP and want to avoid it, so I'll have to see how much it affects my gameplay as I level up.  I hope it's avoidable and not too too bad.  A description at their web site says there are quests in those areas which I never enjoy being forced to go to PvP zones to do quests, especially in game that has so much story and I really am enjoying reading all the quest text.  I'm not really there yet though to see how that's going to affect my play.  It could have a huge negative affect for me and even get me to quit if it's bad enough but I'll just have to wait to get there to see.<br><br>The camera angles really aren't that bad.  I think they limited it in order to make the game work better on lesser systems, I'm not sure.  It runs very smooth and pretty though and I don't really see why they can't allow you to pan it so you can see into the distance a little more but you do have some tilt control and it's really not too bad.<br><br>The one thing I dislike though and very much want to see change is for us to get the ability to use WASD movement in the game.  A lot of games like this launch with click to move movement only, and it's always the same.  I get sick of clicking so much, it's a pain in the butt after a while.  They really need to change the game to allow keyboard movement controls as well.  I know it doesn't work great for every situation, like if people set the camera to auto movement, but they could always disable it if you have auto camera on or find some other work around.  Too many people are going to want WASD movement controls, maybe they'll listen and put them in game in time though.<br><br>So I'm finding a pretty decent game here.  You may want to wait and not chance it, and give it another 4 or 5 days until it's opened for free to everybody, but I for one am very happy with the game as it is and am glad I bought a DLC pack so I could play now.  Even if PvP areas make me quit later (again I still don't know if they will or not, it depends if I can still level and quest around without having to deal with them for the most part) - I still will be happy that I got and played the game.  It's been interesting and fun and is a good example of how to put real story and more meaning into quests.  It also is doing something very right with the skill system all being so different.  Hopefully once it's opened for free a lot of people will find out just how much they like it too.<br><br>The video they have here really doesn't show much of the game, you can find videos elsewhere online of people playing the game if you really want to see how it plays though.  They don't take the time to read and go through all the extra text and things in those videos however, so if you're a person who really likes story and lore in your games you won't really see how cool it is until you're able to get in there yourself.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11519965', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11519965' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11519965\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11519965' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11519965\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11519965', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11519965_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11519965_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t58 of 103 people (56%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11528476\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"79433200\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df754ec88eb86b98ecdfe9c48f29224f0a918e72.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df754ec88eb86b98ecdfe9c48f29224f0a918e72.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df754ec88eb86b98ecdfe9c48f29224f0a918e72_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/\" data-miniprofile=\"79433200\">Pelerin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/games\/?tab=all\">419 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/recommended\/\">48 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039698928\/recommended\/295550\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Royal Quest on August 3, 2014, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 2, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA solid but familiar MMORPG experience.

You get 4 stat-points each level to spend on your main attributes.

But they have more even in the beggining<br><br>Minus<br>-The camera, you can see around like moving the view but deiym, you cant see the sky. .  would love to see sky here.<br>-Boring if u dont read the story<br><br>First of all i want to tell you i have been missing game that can make me feel enjoy and make my leisure time with game more interesting i havent found it since like months. <br><br>The first time i see the game i thought that would be some kind of dungeon game and i really wanted a open world game. However i give a try to this game and i found out its open world, i keep playing, there 4 classes that you can pick. This game bring me a lot of joy from this 2 hours, and i would love to play more.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28420601', 'recent_short' );
