It set such a high bar for me that in some ways Cinderstone Orphanage had a hard time reaching it.  That's not to say the sequel is bad, because it's a very solid hidden object puzzle adventure in its own right, and certainly one of the better examples of the genre.  But, despite being the first game in the series to implement the ability to collect and use powers in its puzzle solving, the very paint-by-numbers feel of the rest of the story and gameplay left me wanting more. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=804335096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=804335096<\/a><br>Once again, the agency's top agent has been tasked with investigating yet another perplexing incident, this time at the Cinderstone Orphanage, home for children with paranormal abilities.  An unexplained Christmas Eve explosion has left the building in shambles and its children and mentor missing, body and all.  It's up to The Agent to get to bottom of the things and rescue the vanished orphans and their caretaker.  I can't say the story had me as intrigued this time around, but anywhere The Agent goes, I go.<br><br>I've always been fond of a more realistic art style in HOGs, and Cinderstone Orphanage falls into that category with its gorgeous painted scenery.  Unlike most modern-day titles in which bright blues, reds and purples feature prominently, Cinderstone's color palette is subdued with the images all having a softly classical feel to them.  As I explored the orphanage, there were areas that I'd sit admiring the breathtaking view for several minutes, especially rooms barely touched by the explosion.  If only I'd been able to behold its beauty before the conflagration overtook it.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=805709795\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=805709795<\/a><br>Gameplay is fairly standard HOPA fare, save for the addition of acquiring special powers that are used in puzzle solving and further exploration of the game areas.  Looking through walls, moving items with your mind and bringing drawn pictures to life all have a distinct charm to them, though I would have preferred a little more challenge in their use.  Items and areas that are to be manipulated glow the respective ability's color, which makes little sense to me since you have no way of choosing which ability to use as the game does it for you.  Not a huge complaint, just something I'd prefer to have been more game-y than it is.  <br><br>Story-wise, this entry is the weakest in the series.  I understand that a majority of HOG players are women (although that seems to be changing), so plots that appeal to the maternal instinct tend to crop up quite a bit; and while it's nice to see The Agent concerned for the children's welfare, having him outwit freaks and monstrosities gives his adventures some edge.  The writing is more sparse as well with about half the number of journal entries as Mystic Hospital and less character-building mouse over text, something I sorely missed.  What's there seems to be more to the point without as much of The Agent's sarcastic flare that I so love.  Alas.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=805709768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=805709768<\/a><br>Fortunately, the bonus chapter nicely fills in missing story details, adds on to the series' over-arcing plotline, and gives us a hint as to where The Agent will be going next. Theater freaks you say?  YES!  The gameplay is also enjoyable with The Agent exploring a handful of newly uncovered areas, new puzzles (and old ones with added difficulty), and just enough hidden object scenes to keep you busy, but not totally inundated as they were in Mystic Hospital.  <br><br>Having said all that, would I recommend Cinderstone Orphanage?  Absolutely!  As a continuation of The Agency of Anomalies storyline, it's a worthy entry to the series with solid HOPA gameplay and a gorgeous world to explore.  I'd say most of my disappointments are based on personal taste, and while I'd have liked a creepier atmosphere to the game, others may find the story and themes fully entertaining.  So yes, definitely grab this along with Mystic Hospital when you get the chance.  Here's looking forward to The Last Performance.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27469180', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27469180' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27469180\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27469180' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27469180\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27469180', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27469180_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27469180_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/558670\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["27469180"]}
