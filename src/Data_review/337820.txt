At first glance, the game may look light and simple but very quickly you begin to see that this is a deep, well-designed strategy\/god-mode game. The graphics are very detailed, the artwork is beautiful, the mechanics are flawless. If you think that because its a god-mode strategy game that it will be boring, then guess again. There is plenty of action\/activities to keep you busy without having to micro-manage your units and economy.  Research will increase the options and powers available during gameplay while continuing to upgrade and expand your alien colony. For any strategy gaming fan, I strongly recommend picking this game up. Most games are only moderately worth their sale prices, especially indie games. But this game is well worth the full price.<br><br>The big name gaming developers should take a few lessons from the Squatting Penguins Studio. This is how a game is supposed to be released. Out-of-the-box, ready to play. 100+ hours of gameplay and I have yet to experience a single bug. No glitches in gameplay, no graphics hiccups or units falling through maps, no game crashes. The game runs smooth and seamlessly like any released game should. Even more amazing is that this is still an early-access game so bugs and glitches are normally accepted and typically expected. A lot of care and effort went into this release and true gamers will notice and appreciate it right away.<br><br>Without going into a lengthy game description, The Mims Beginning will have the typical RTS simulation components, but with its own distinct approach. Expect a well-balanced economic system, a rich story to tie the campaign missions together nicely, an assortment of interesting buildings and units to build as you establish your camps, and a variety of research.<br><br>The one area that is lacking when compared to most games of this genre is the variety of units. In this game, you have only a couple of types to choose from. The basic, or generic Mim performs assorted tasks as you assign them rather than being specialized. Perhaps in the future more unit types will be added, but the game functions just fine with the current unit structure. The developer has stated that more features and game modes will be added as development progresses. As for the game's mechanics and features, here are some things that you should know:<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>The Good:<br>========<\/b><\/div><i>+  Graphics are top-notch and run flawlessly even on the highest settings. Great detail and color<br>+  Absence of bugs\/crashes (Makes a game much more enjoyable)<br>+  Gameplay is rich and deep with a clever resource economy and challenging goals<br>+  Learning curve is acceptable for beginners and an in-depth tutorial campaign is included<br>+  Camera controls are included and easy to use while navigating the maps<br>+  Although this is a God-mode game, autonomy option is able to be turned off when desired<br>+  Simple game controls \/ Window mode available if desired<br>+ Well-developed story for the campaign mode<\/i><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>The Bad: <br>=======<\/b><\/div><i>-  No save feature included in current release<br>-  Limited options for adjusting graphics in the event your system has trouble running the game<br>-  Window mode is restricted to specifically selected screen resolutions only.<br>-  Currently not a lot of replay value (likely to change in the final version with Survival Mode)<br>- The AI for units is sometimes frustrating as they seem to wander aimlessly about rather than perform their assigned tasks (possibly by design?)<\/i><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Final thoughts:<br>===========<\/b><\/div>Keep in mind that at the time of this review, the game is still in Early Access beta and will likely improve and include more features. Considering that, this game is very impressive. At first glance it looks like its going to be some simple cartoon-ish indie that will fill an hour or two of free time. But nothing could be further from the truth. Hours of challenging and entertaining gameplay awaits and a good bit of light humor is mixed into the storyline as well. Rarely do I enjoy an early access game this much. I anxiously await the final release.<br><br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22900335', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22900335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22900335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22900335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22900335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22900335', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22900335_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22900335_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t61 of 92 people (66%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13987951\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"24770364\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24770364\">seph.au<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/games\/?tab=all\">8,746 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/recommended\/\">326 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Mims Beginning was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 14, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDid products like Godus leave a bad taste in your mouth?

Getting taught the basics of colony management you are then left on your own to proceed through the story, which not only is amusing but somewhat believable, mostly because of the wonderful art direction and accompaning soundtrack. Intro gameplay involves getting your power stations running, researching new plants and species for exporting to markets on alternate planets, giving your Mims a place for some well deserved R&amp;R, all while trying to deter or kill any invasive 'pests' that may land on your rock in the sky.<br><br>While I've only played through the earlier stages, for an early access product so far it's more polished then most games at final release. This team are obviously fans of the genre as everything about it screams a labour of love. Highly recommend checking it out, fantastic game which is only getting better.

However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.<br><br>The Mims Beginning reminds me a lot of the game &quot;Spore&quot;, mostly because of the art-style, but also because they're both game about managing a tribe of alien lifeforms to complete certain goals. I won't reveal too much about the story but basically you are a god of some-sort going from island to island, creating living conditions, protection and technology for the lost Mims. You, as the god, have various powers and abilities to aid the Mims as well. Like most real time strategy god games, The Mims Beginning has other elements implemented into game like structure\/city building, unit and resource management, as well as upgrading buildings and units. There are two game modes, the campaign and survival. <br><br>There are a few things I'd like to point out before I quickly break down the game into separate sections. Although the game is in early access, I encountered no bugs or glitches which is impressive. This is one of the only god games I've played that let you select individual units to perform tasks as well as letting them be autonomous, which I like, but other people might not agree with that. Lastly, with the easy progression and lightheartedness of the game itself, it's a good game for beginners who want to try to get into this genre of game or games similar to this one.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Graphics: 7 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The art-style is subjective, but I enjoyed it. It has a playful, colorful, fun vibe to the game. It wasn't too hard on my PC, and I'm running a mid-tier Nvidia Card and CPU. I do feel the animation quality could be a little better and smoother though, but it is in early access and I know everything has not been fleshed out yet. Although after staring at the game for awhile, it does start to get a tad monotonous, though that is to be expected with such games.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Sound: 6 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The sound assets are fine, there isn't much that's extraordinary or below standards. I will say that I didn't get tired of the noises or background music, so that's good. However, there was this one theme in a cut scene, in between the campaign scenarios that I really liked, it was this gospel-ish tone and it was really soothing.  There isn't any voice acting in the game from what I can tell. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Mechanics: 6 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The mechanics were solid, but there wasn't much that really set it apart from other god games or made it more enjoyable that others. That being said, like stated earlier, the mechanics are perfect for someone who would want to give this genre a try and then try other god-games. Aside from structure placement, there isn't that much customization in the game, the only terraforming in the game is burning down trees. There are however quite a few animal and plant types to mess around with, as well as cool abilities your Mims get as well as yourself as the god. <br><br><br>--------<br><br><b> Final Personal Remarks <\/b><br><br>The game is good for beginners in this genre, it's not the best god game ever created, but it's not terrible. It's impressive that it was done by two devs. The game is competent and does what it set out to do. This type of game didn't keep me hooked as it's not the kind of game I'm used to playing or have too much experience with, but I can see how some people would enjoy it. One thing I will say about this game, despite all that, is that I liked the narrative and although I've only played for 10 hours, I'm interested in the story, and would like to know more about the Mims, their homeworld, their experiences. The game did a great job of keeping me hooked into the story. <br><br>Thanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23028699', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23028699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23028699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23028699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23028699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23028699', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23028699_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23028699_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t46 of 72 people (64%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14482648\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">El Kemosabe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,218 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Mims Beginning was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***<br><br>The Mims Beginning is real-time strategic God game that is currently available in Early Access developed by a small independent developer.

You play as the first deity that the Mims, a strange and cute looking alien race, encounters after they crash land on a series of floating islands while fleeing their doomed homeworld.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall gameplay impressions<\/div><br>The game starts you off with a pretty decent tutorial that teaches you the basics while leaving room for discovery as you play, either through survival or story mode. At its core, the game might seem some somewhat complicated at first but, once you get the hang of the major mechanics you\u2019ll see that it isn\u2019t that complicated at all, but it does offer some degree of challenge and requires you to plan on how you expand and what you choose to build and research. You have to keep a steady supply of biomass, which you can get from certain plants, energy to power your buildings and gems, which you can get either by selling adult animals to offworld marketplaces or by finding them in each level.<br><br>That said, there is one complaint I have about this and that is the fact that to construct buildings and create certain units you\u2019ll need gems. The thing is that these gems are limited in quantity and you can get yourself in a position where you\u2019ll have to restart the entire mission. Yes, the entire mission, because unfortunately <b><u>the game doesn\u2019t have a save function<\/u><\/b>. One time I lost about an hour of gameplay because of miscalculation of resources. Still, that was a one case scenario and usually missions are shorter than that.<br><br>While most of the game relies on autonomous actions from your Mims to gather resources and ensure that your settlement keeps on going, you also get to play an active role on this process. You can use various powers to boost your Mims or to protect them from dangers such as, creating fire or giving your Mims a boost in speed, health and energy, but you\u2019re also able to directly control individual Mims such as warriors and some \u201chero\u201d units. While you\u2019re actively trying to protect your settlement from pests and predators, combat doesn\u2019t really play a huge role like in other RTS. The game presents some pretty well thought mechanics such as pests, catastrophes and predators which some are triggered based on the smell of your settlement (for real) and things like the amount of livestock that you have at any given time. You can actually research some technologies that allow you to predict when these will happen, which is shown in a bar at the bottom of the screen.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Visuals and narrative<\/div><br>In terms of actual story, usually at the beginning of each mission and sometimes when a certain event is triggered, there are some the conversations between characters presented in the form of cutscenes, which unfortunately are not voice acted, but the dialogue still manages to pull out some nice humour. The story is well presented both visually and in terms of narrative, right at the start it kind of teases you what happened that led the Mims to have to flee their planet, which kept me interested in going on, and it also introduces you to some unique characters that help shape the story and add character to these little folks.<br><br>One thing I must say is that <b><u>performance is somewhat of a hit or miss<\/u><\/b>. The game is not really quite the looker (aesthetically I think it looks good, what I mean is in terms of graphical fidelity by todays standards) but the Mims themselves look rather nice and the buildings have this sort of steampunk look to them which I find to be rather appealing.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Final verdict<\/b><\/div><br><b>Overall, despite the major flaw which I consider to be the lack of a save function, The Mims Beginning managed to surprise me. It mixes elements from god games and city building\/management and puts them in a world where you have to look out after this little tribe while helping them restore their former glory.

But fear not! The Mims possessed an item which has the capability of restoring planets and before the horrific destruction of their home world they were able to jettison it to safety. Unfortunately it's ship was hit by debris from a meteor and all systems were shut down leaving it floating helplessly through space and no way for the Mims to reach it. With the help of you, their new God, the Mims must locate this if they ever want to flourish happily again and have any hopes of seeing their home rebuilt.<br><br>The Mims Beginning starts with an awesome little story and I found myself captivated right away. Your job as a God is to guide the Mims to safety and help them slowly rebuild and become prosperous like they once were. There are two modes to the game, the first and main being the Story mode. This is the mode that you'll want to start playing as not only does it contain the tutorial but also progressing through this this mode allows you to unlock the buildings and god powers in a specific order and will help you learn what they each do one by one. The Story mode follows the story of the Mims and you'll make your way through it by completing the objectives you have on each level\/map which will in turn unlock the next. Survival mode on the other hand has all buildings, research and God powers unlocked and may be a little overwhelming or confusing to those new to the game. Survival mode has four difficulties that you must try to survive through starting at Easy up to Very Hard. You can also customize your own difficulty so you can choose if you want a relaxing sandbox style play, or something much more challenging to push yourself.<br><br>To help the Mims survive in either mode you'll need to guide them by telling them which buildings they need to create much like other God games. Your Mims will build what you tell them too and can also be told to go to specific places but other than that your Mims will carry out the task they most feel important. There are different types of Mims which you will encounter as the game goes on and these vary from Mims like Workers who do the day to day jobs, Guardians who patrol and protect the other Mims and even Shamans who can sense other Mim colonies that are in danger and allow you to help them. You also have various unlockable God powers to help you influence the Mim world further such as a group heal to revitalize and heal your Mims, fruit rain for when you run low on Biomass and things like a Psi cage used for trapping enemies and a Psi bolt for when you need to get offensive. All of these can be cast using Psi energy which is generated over time. <br><br>You'll need both Biomass and Gems to build\/create in your world, the main being Biomass. Biomass is harvested from Fruit which can randomly be found growing in most worlds, but can also be created from your own fruit plants. Biomass is used for almost everything from building things to creating animals or powering buildings. Gems, however, are harder to come by as you can only receive them from a few sources. Buying and raising animals will be your main source of Gems but you can also find limited deposits on your island and some God powers will help you also but those these aren't unlocked right away. Once you've grasped correctly managing those two sources its up to you to build, survive and complete your objectives as you see fit. <br>The dialogue throughout the game is both charming and humorous and the cutscenes give the Mims  substance rather than just being 'things' you control like it is in most God games. I started to feel rather attached to my Mims and in one particular mission (I won't give any spoilers) I found myself heartbroken at my helplessness during a certain event.<br><br>As with most games The Mims beginning does have some little flaws. My two noticeable cons with the game are minor ones to me but some might find them much larger as they do impact the gameplay. The first is <b>there is NO save mode<\/b>. I'm going to repeat this as there are many negative comments I've found about this simple fact. <b>THERE IS NOT A SAVE FEATURE.<\/b> This applies to both story and survival mode so if you're looking for a game that you can come back and play the same save later this is not it. If you are like me, however, and enjoy smaller sessions you won't find any issues with this. This is something that'll not be added either as you can read <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/337820\/discussions\/2\/361787186427337102\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a> (the devs tried for a month and a half to implement it and it reaped no results and detracted from developing content). My second issue is more of a personal one but things can become rather overwhelming if you're not careful as there is a lot going on. Guardians are rather weak on their own so you'll heavily rely on using your god powers at first to destroy enemies so you'll constantly have to be checking your map for any new mob spawns. Speeding up the game increases the speed that enemies spawn so you have a choice between speeding through production and risk being overrun by enemies quickly or playing most of your game on a slower mode which can become a little tiresome especially since there is no save feature. You also have to produce animals manually one by one so you can't have the game running fast for any long period of time or you'll end up wasting time as you often forget to keep producing them. I did ask the devs if they plan to change this and they've replied saying they will look into it which is awesome! :D<br><br><b>The Mims Beginning overall is a fantastic game with a charming story and the kind of gameplay that keeps you coming back. Despite it's lack of a save feature The Mims Beginnings trumps most of the other God Games out there and really is a wonderful project and a great example of just what Greenlight can bring to Steam.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22881545', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22881545' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22881545\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22881545' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22881545\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22881545', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22881545_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22881545_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22918262\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Psygineer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40955358\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e3fdb7112eabe54a1eee849a47a8d8d433338f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e3fdb7112eabe54a1eee849a47a8d8d433338f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2e\/2e3fdb7112eabe54a1eee849a47a8d8d433338f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Psygineer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40955358\">Psygineer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Psygineer\/games\/?tab=all\">1,862 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Psygineer\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Psygineer\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Mims Beginning was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div><br>The Mims Beginning is a real time strategic \u201cGod-Game\u201d. There currently are not too many of those available on Steam which is really a shame. You play the role of the first powerful looking being the Mims have seen since they crashed. This causes them to assume you are their new God. Use your PSI powers and colony building prowess to aid the fledgling colony build up the resources needed to continue their trek to recover the fragments of their crashed ship.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay Impressions<\/div><br>The Mims are a rather cute looking alien race that sort of have the appearance of gloved hands. The way they speak and act further emphasizes the fact they are a charmingly sweet race. You want to do your very best to protect them from the nasty evils of the world. For the most part, those evils are pests that are either herbivores that try to steal the Mims food\/building supplies or carnivores that attempt to eat anything meaty, including the Mims themselves, their livestock and the herbivore pests. Natural disasters can also plague the land from meteor strikes to earthquakes; the Mims sure have it rough. Luckily for the Mims, you are there to lend a hand. For example, you can put out the wild fires or help plants grow by making it rain, use PSI blasting or burning to take care of pests, cheering up the unhappy Mims or use some of your other \u201cGodly\u201d PSI powers to aid them. You also guide the Mims on how to build their colony in order to fulfill their objectives in that land.<br><br>There are two primary building supplies, biomass and gems. Biomass is produced from refining plant matter. Biomass is far easier to keep in stock than the gems. Gems can be acquired by mining any exposed gem deposits but those are few and far between. The best way to earn gems is through raising livestock and selling them off-world. This can pose a problem if you were not paying enough attention while building your initial colony. If you don\u2019t ensure you have enough gems to produce the buildings required to produce and ship the livestock, you will find yourself having to restart the level. It would help if you could find a few gems laying around the map in areas you can hit with your powers or, if you have one available, are able to send a guardian to blast.<br><br>Mims can be classed into three main categories. Guardians are your main line of defense against the pests. They will shoot at any enemy near them and try to kill it. Unfortunately, if they are hunting alone, they tend to get scared and unhappy rather quickly. They may end up running around being attacked by the pests rather than focusing on trying to kill them. This often leads to your guardians dying. You can put them into a formation but that automatically disables movement autonomy leaving you having to manually control the formation. Workers build your buildings, collect the plant matter to make the biomass, and generally carry things from one point to another. Officers and other hero units generally have a special ability that sets them apart from a Guardian or the general worker Mims. <br><br>The building construction in the game is simple enough. There generally is one building to fit each of the needs and for the most part, that building can be upgraded to enhance its effect. Power generation is an exception to that rule. For example, you can build wind turbines that keep your buildings powered so long as there is wind (which unfortunately is often blowing too slowly to keep your buildings consistently running), or you can build a generator fueled by biomass (unfortunately it burns through biomass like crazy). Unless you have a lot of workers and biomass producing plants around, you will still often find yourself without power. There are enough building varieties in the game to satisfy those of us who like base building games. It isn\u2019t the most complex building game ever, but it isn\u2019t branding itself as an in-depth city builder. For a \u201cGod-Game\u201d it is perfectly sufficient.<br><br>I mentioned planting extra biomass producing plants to keep the generator running and you probably were thinking, that seems simple enough, what could possibly go wrong with doing that? Ignoring any expense involved as most plants don\u2019t need gems and therefore pay for themselves in time, the problem is they make your island smell. Livestock (the gem producer) also smell! Smell in this game is what attracts the pests. If your floating island smells of fruity plants too much, herbivores will show up and start eating your crops. If you smell of meat too much, carnivores will show up and snack on your livestock and Mims. This makes you have to carefully consider and weigh the consequences of your actions. You could change the tide of the game very quickly just by rushing your gem or biomass production faster than you can produce the guardians needed to defend it.<br><br>Even if you have a ton of guardians and workers, you may find yourself overwhelmed by pests. The reason for this is simple, as mentioned earlier; your Mims can become either unhappy or scared. Unless a Mim is happy, they will not do their job efficiently or maybe won\u2019t even do their jobs at all. Workers not collecting biomass fast enough will cause even more pests to show up due to the smell. Guardians who are too scared or unhappy to fight will often find themselves being killed by the pests rather than clearing the pests out. You can use your PSI Power to cheer them up if you can target them and you have the energy available to do so, but that is highly inefficient and is really a losing battle. You can build houses to help make your Mims happy, and that works great\u2026 but I often found myself with multiple houses scattered around with a ton of unhappy Mims aimlessly walking about. The houses were turned on so I\u2019m not sure why they didn\u2019t really use them much. The ones that did though, came out of them chipper and willing to work. I\u2019m thinking this is just an Early Access bug or perhaps I am missing something that I need to do to make them use the houses more often.<br><br>Overall, The Mims Beginning is a satisfying \u201cGod-Game\u201d that I hope leads the way to a sequel or in the very least other developers jumping on the \u201cGod-Game\u201d bandwagon. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Pros:\n\n<li>Many of the Islands (if not all) contain an Easter egg for you to find.

Probably pretty routine and slightly boring if you think about it. Then again, you\u2019ve never lorded over a tiny alien sharecropper farm on a small slab of asteroid. Owned by a crew of crash-landed aliens called the Mims, you will soon be call to aid them in defending it from every other form of life out there. Once you\u2019ve established your ramshackle farm, you begin to branch out. First a few more workers, maybe an upgrade to the city hall. Oh, you need to have a trading port! The game is cutesy, but much deeper than the child-friendly design would lead you to believe. Eventually an alien metropolis spreads out as far as the eye can see. Farm animals swarm the gardens, devouring anything they can in order to grow strong and be sold to what I assume is a cutesy alien slaughterhouse. The tiny Mim workers, and the tough Mim guardians, all working in harmony within the little slice of heaven that I\u2019ve so benevolently created for them. Maybe you see a worker or two slacking off? You\u2019d be perfectly within your rights to burn them with a fire spell. How else will they ever learn right from wrong? It feels good to be a God that\u2019s so involved! Whether you are a benevolent ruler, or a vengeful one, The Mims Beginning is a real pleasure to play.<br><br>First off, I\u2019d like to state that I\u2019m quite impressed by the graphics that indie studios can put out these days. This game has been in development for 3 years, and while the age shows slightly, it is far above the average indie game. The buildings are strangely designed and outlandish, just like the little orange minions operating them. The multitude of pests and predators that will eventually make an appearance pulls it all together and makes for a nice comfy experience that is pleasing to the eye. I feel a lot more could\u2019ve been done with the sound. The soundtrack is passable, mostly because I\u2019m largely distracted by the beauty of my adorable alien empire. Don\u2019t let appearances fool you though. This game doesn\u2019t hesitate to teach you through pain. After building a village for thirty minutes, it is pillaged by spiders. How did this happen? Glad I asked. The gameplay mechanics at work here are intricate. To build almost anything, you need either Gems, Biomass, or both. Farming Biomass involves creating a garden, the fruits of which can be thrown into an Extractor. The resulting Biomass currency can be used for a multitude of things, but you will always be in need of more. So you plant even more fruit trees. Eventually the pests show up because fruit has been sitting under a hot alien sun, and pursuing the pests are predators which won\u2019t hesitate to devastate your town. Predators can clear a lot of pests, if you have an infestation don\u2019t hesitate to let them do some dirty work. They can also clear a lot of Mims, so keep a watchful eye and have a haste or heal spell handy.<br><br>The other form of currency is received by selling farm animals at market. This requires a spaceport and a bio lab, and if they aren\u2019t built with your first handful of Gems it\u2019s basically a game-over. I feel this requires reevaluation but tweaks and balance changes have been promised so I won\u2019t judge that too harshly. Aside from all this farming business, sending minions to work or combat, controlling the electrical grid, and averting natural disasters with your ability to predict the future\u2026 A truly good God will find time to better his underlings, teaching them skills. He will bring new Mims to replace the ones that have fallen in combat or a misplaced PSI spell\u2026 Even if I did sort of do it on purpose. I\u2019m sure even immortal beings are permitted a small giggle of laughter when watching an adorable alien scream as he plummets into nothingness. The Mims have some silly one-liners during cut-scenes that let me know this game has a good humor about itself. It also covers two genres that are sorely lacking, RTS and God-likes. I count The Mims Beginning as a cool breath of fresh air for lovers of both genres, as long as they aren\u2019t afraid to enjoy some downright silliness.<br><br>On the negative side; the music seems quite generic, which simply shouldn\u2019t be the case on an alien world. Survival mode is not yet implemented, and story-mode levels take a long time to beat. About or more than thirty minutes for each one, so not the type of game you can pick and and play if you only have 10 minutes (though this is likely to change with survival mode). The Mims have their own personalities, but as far as I can tell each one looks almost identical. Making them more individualized would add a great deal to the experience for me. Finally, the camera controls threw me off as well. Q and E are used to zoom in\/out, while panning can only be done by mousing to the edge of the screen. Despite its few flaws, I found The Mims Beginning to be an extremely intriguing game that never failed to capture that \u201cone-more-turn\u201d feeling when close to unlocking the next structure or upgrade. Wonderful game, and a big thank you to the folks at Squatting Penguin. I hope that The Mims Beginning is just the start for you guys.<br><br>Summary: Alien city-building RTS with adorable graphics and deep strategy.<br>Final Score: 8\/10 for aesthetic, replayability, and innovation.<br><br>Full text\/photos: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.indiegamebundles.com\/review-mims-beginning-early-access\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.indiegamebundles.com\/review-mims-beginning-early-access\/<\/a><br>Video Review: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GsJf7exqciY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GsJf7exqciY<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13989358', 'summary' );

Your job is to guide and assist a small race of beings known as Mims by directing them around the small asteroid on which they live. Gameplay is simple, just click on a Mim and tell him where to go. The game shares a lot of similarities with other genres as well, such as real time strategy and city builders. This is made evident by the building menus fulls of structures that you can have your Mims build to aid in their way of life. In addition to building, you also have a menu where you can use a number of &quot;God Powers&quot;, known as PSI. These can range from refreshing your Mims' fatigue levels, or offering protection from outside threats.<br><br>The gameplay can be a tad slow, but the devs have stated that they are working on numerous fixes, including an adjustment to the camera controls (which are solely keyboard keys, no mouse involved). Anyway, once you select a building for your Mims to build, you choose where it is to be built. Once placed, your little alien friends will go and build the selected building. Thankfully, there is a meter when you click on a building in progress that shows how long until building is finished. There are 2 main resources: Biomass and Gems. Gaining biomass requires creating a garden, where food and organic material are harvested and then thrown into a machine to create biomass. Gems are acquired by selling things at the market, which comes bit later into the game. To do this, you need a bio-lab and a spaceport, but if you don't spend your starter Gems on these 2 items, you are pretty much stuck. Something that needs adjusted for sure!<br><br>Graphically, things are a bit behind for our standards in the recent year, but for a small indie studio they are quite impressive. Everything is also bright, colorful, and eye-catching. As for the sound and music, they are a bit bland but they work well for the setting in which they are used. The game just looks great and has a lot of personality. The Mims themselves are a comedic bunch, prefering to slouch around and eat instead of work, which I guess is why they need you around for guidance! There is a story as to why they are now stranded on this asteroid and repairing their ship, but it just serves to make silly jokes via dialogue. And that's not a bad thing. The game shines in it's gameplay, not the story.<br><br>Despite the many issues the game may have right now, the devs have stated that they are working on improving things.

Keep that in mind, I didn't play it for long yet. But I'm writing it, as I don't know if I will play it again.<br><br>It's a small, little (under a gig) game. It's a bit like Populous 3 and Black &amp; White in some aspects, but it seems inferior to both those titles sadly.<br>Amazingly, there are no modern-era alternatives and the game can be a little fun during a sale. Up to 8 \u20ac is maybe worth it, but not much more than that.<br>Graphics are cartoony and ok-ish. Not impressive, or even better than Black &amp; White, but it's much of a lesser game, made by a smaller low-budget team.<br>There is absolutely no voice acting, only text messages, they are not very entertaining, more like bland even.<br>Still, the core of the game is not bad. Build simple economy, use PSI powers (magic basically). Seems familliar?<br><br>Well, it should. It's meant to be a smaller god game for kids. It delivers that. Still, don't have too high expectations of it or you will be burned.<br><br>5,5\/10, maybe a bit generous, as I didn't play it for too long yet. And it didn't draw me to try. I might update the review at a later date.<br><br>It's lacking.

There is not a lot of depth to the game. It is simply place a few buildings and wait for the characters to build up mass to build a few things more. Rince &amp; repeat, repeat, get stuck, restart, repeat, repeat, repeat. It can get monotonus quickly but at the same time that is something you're really just looking for in a game... simple. <br><br>To counter the gather-&amp;-build they seem to have added a few features to add depth\/difficulty. Only the issue is that the game quickly gets too difficult to keep up play since monsters come too quickly &amp; mims tire too quickly. You come to a point where you literally can do nothing because you have no money to build &amp; no mims to make the mass that buys things. It becomes a moot, frozen game. Even on the slowest setting I couldn't make it through more than 20 minutes of the survival play because the strongest beast kept getting dropped on my island 2+ at a time. Don't get me wrong, I love a challenging game and am bored into quiting if things are too easy, but this seems to have no build up difficult and instead just has constant stream of same difficulty. Which means it kills or gets you stuck into impobility early if you don't happen to luck out on the monster drops &amp; rate you can build necessary buildings. <br><br>Despite than that I have enjoyed the occasiona play and would recommend trying if you have a chance to pick it up on sale.  You will spend time enough and constantly be drawn back to try again after a time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24344821', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24344821' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24344821\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24344821' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24344821\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24344821', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24344821_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24344821_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24338789\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073594126\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"113328398\">DerpyCat<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 62.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction (scroll down to the review if you only want to know what the game is about)<br><br>After buying lots and lots of games and only playing a few of them, I decided only to buy games that I really want to play right now. The Mims looked so interesting that I bought it, and I didn't regret it. Since I really like games like Spore, Minecraft and also games like Anno and Civilisations, this is a game for me.<br><br><br>Review<br><br>The Mims is a game about building a small alien tribe. It is easy to understand but can be quite a challenge during the story. If you like taking care of aliens, getting them to work for you and building new stuff for them, this game is for you. Although it seems that the game does't have many things to do, there is a ton of stuff you can explore and you really have to think about what you want to build next and what you need to do.<br>I haven't completed the story yet (which is really funny in my opinion) but so far, I had a lot of fun and definitely want to finish it. If you know Spore, the style of the game is a bit similar, with the difference that you cannot create your own creatures, which is not a problem because it has other features that Spore doesn't have. After all, they are different games.<br><br>This is all I have to say about the game now. I hope to help some people with their decision when you are thinking about buying The Mims.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24338789', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24338789' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24338789\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24338789' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24338789\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24338789', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24338789_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24338789_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24304398\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/recommended\/337820\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"51982778\">Nerney9<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received The Mims Beginning for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Short Version: <\/b>  Bumbling little space-faring critters turn to you, their mystical psionic deity, to tell them when, where, and what to build, gather, eat,  sleep, or scratch.  Amusing gameplay and story make this game worth a look, but if you're not a fan of god-games in general then The Mims probably won't convert* you.    *<i>Ha!  Pun intended.<\/i><br><br>--<br><br>The Mims Beginning puts a spacefaring spin on the god-game genre, putting you in charge of a hardy yet hapless band of alien 'Mims', which seem to be the genetic crossbreed of a rubber glove and a well-shaven Furby.  You command the Mims through a journey across various sky-islands, directing their actions and providing miraculous aid as they build up temporary settlements and complete objectives before moving on to the next phase of their quest (and a new map for you).<br><br>Your role in the game is to act as the Mim's deity of sorts, which basically is the same role as any other RTS game - you direct them to gather resources, place buildings, and then purchase new units and upgrades as you see fit.  However, instead of controlling units to battle an opponent, you instead use your Psionic powers to help your Mim's overcome the (un)natural world and it's various pesky inhabitants, aiding your followers and blowing up anything that tries to get in your way.  <br> <br>There are a few unusual systems in the Mims such as keeping track of excess scents (which attract pests and predators) and the way plants *throw* the food resource around the map.  This makes for an interesting experience in the game, but can also be a bit tricky to get a handle on.  Fortunately there are tutorial popups to walk you through most of it.  <br><br>The graphics in the game are satisfactory in a cutesy-Indie type of way, as is the background sound.  The only real negative of note is that the game does not allow saving in the middle of a map - once you start a mission, you are committed to either completing the scenario or starting again from scratch.  This might be seen as a 'feature' by people who hate the constant saving\/loading that is easy to resort to in modern games, but this is also a crazy annoyance when you accidentally spend most of a map's crystals (a scarce resource), or even when you simply want to go eat dinner.<br><br><b>Conclusion:<\/b>  <br>The Mims provides a refreshingly satisfying take on the god-game genre.  The large campaign is filled with quirky little cutscenes for story-ish background, and contains plenty of innovative mechanisms to support the reasonably enjoyable, laidback gameplay.  The Mims may lack a real 'wow' factor, but every part of the experience is pleasantly amusing - which makes it a more-than-decent addition to any god-sim gamer's library.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24304398', 'recent_short' );

The play is fun and fascinating, exactly enough hard and has a nice humour. The only thing that is certainly missing is a sandbox. Instead, the game offers survival mode, but it ends after you play for a certain amount of time, without any warning.<br>It is a game that makes you consider physics to prosper and at the same time isn't brain-breaking. Lack of save during a game is a minus, but not massively frustrating in my opinion.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23908631', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23908631' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23908631\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23908631' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23908631\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23908631', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23908631_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23908631_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/337820\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 165 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22900335","13987951","23028699","14482648","23522202","23054934","22881545","22918262","13989358","14406883"]}
