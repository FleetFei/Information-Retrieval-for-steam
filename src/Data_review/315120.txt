That lofty goal is however still aways off.  What you'll find at this early stage in development is some fairly crude stuff.  Notwithstanding, I've had fun with what I've played.<br><br>As with every Early Access game, however, what you're paying for is potential (paying if you buy the DLC, that is).  Right now I have to ask myself whether the devs aren't perhaps wasting a lot of effort with this game.  After all, we already have Team Fortress 2.  Why do a clone?  I would suppose the simplest answer to this question being -- why not do a clone?  If one thing is successful, does that presuppose that someone else shouldn't try to do the same thing and try to beat the original at its own game?  I mean, that's the core of virtually all business, isn't it?  All businesses try to do something better which others are already doing.<br><br>Since this is Early Access, prepare for some rough patches, including:<br><br>- few players<br>- few maps<br>- maps are overly simplistic, crude and small<br>- general lack of detail (and personality) with regards to character models<br>- low resolution textures<br>- gun models take up far too much visual space, blocking your view<br>- only three playable classes<br>- and they are horribly unbalanced<br>- stock music which doesn't fit the theme or the action<br><br>Right now, during Winter Sale 2014, the DLC pack is \u20ac0,41.  I've decided to buy a few and hand them out to friends to try and get the community going.  If the developers buck the Early Access trend and actually make this into a game worth playing, i.e. a product that rivals Team Fortress 2 for its polish and accessibility (while embracing the competitive edge lacking in TF2's model), then we'll be on to a winner.<br><br>In my opinion, there is a market for a competitive FPS starring cutesy animals wielding big guns (provided the guns don't block half the screen).  Now let's hope Hyper Hippo Prods. don't screw up their particular stab at that market.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13503198', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13503198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13503198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13503198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13503198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13503198', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13503198_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13503198_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["13503198"]}
