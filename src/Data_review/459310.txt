We're told (quite often) about the various trials that marginalized hero types face, but rarely see it in practice.  It's definitely part of the background, but for the most part, you're simply told that &quot;X circumstance exists, and needs to change&quot; without much in the way of showcasing it.  That said, I honestly found it LESS jarring than an instance in &quot;Heroes Rise: The Hero Project&quot; where a discussion of &quot;camp&quot; completely derailed things for a few pages before returning to action as normal, and that's likely because it's a central story-arc this time around.<br><br>That said, this seems to be playing up an X-Men vs. Brotherhood of Mutants deal regarding your character, who's an &quot;ani-powered&quot; (think Beast Boy, but with no semblance of control over what form he takes each day), though there's no payoff in this particular game for it.  Like the original series, odds are this one is going to be setting up a few factors in order to include them later.<br><br>Overall, worth playing the Demo - if you like it at that point, feel free to buy (if it gets too preachy, you shouldn't have enough time invested to void the Refund option), and if you don't, you can save yourself the time\/money.  Or just wait for a bundle deal once the full &quot;season&quot; is out.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22526964', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22526964' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22526964\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22526964' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22526964\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22526964', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22526964_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22526964_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22308163\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/encore_90\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51018399\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b01237a1d318b4bd28453c39e8129bd2f54cf6e7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b01237a1d318b4bd28453c39e8129bd2f54cf6e7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b0\/b01237a1d318b4bd28453c39e8129bd2f54cf6e7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/encore_90\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51018399\">Matt Murdock<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/encore_90\/games\/?tab=all\">170 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/encore_90\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/encore_90\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(Edited on 12\/04\/16 for grammar\/punctuation and adding a few more thoughts.)<br><br>I'm a big fan of the Heroes Rise series and of Choice of Games in general. It's wonderful to be able to go back in time to the days of reading through a CYOA book as a kid.<br><br>The Heroes Rise trilogy of games followed your own individual character who you coould customise with a few options such as gender, sexual orientation, codename, powers, etc. Throughout each game, you'd be faced with choices, some critical and some not so much, which would further tailor your character in terms of their sense of justice, their morals and their opinions on how powered individuals fit in society at large. It was a great story told over three games and there was a real sense of being a small cog in a big machine as other characters in this world evolved alongside you throughout the three games. In short, you should definitely go and play those three games before playing this one.<br><br>If you have played the Heroes Rise trilogy, you can choose to carry your save data over to this game (though I did encounter a very annoying bug which meant I had to play through the whole of the last game again to make a fresh save which could be uploaded) which means that even though you're playing as an entirely new character, you'll get to encounter some fun little callbacks and some additional worldbuilding, courtesy of the choices you made in the HR trilogy. <br><br>But what about this game? The Hero Project (THP from now on) has you once again take on the role of a customisable super hero who, in short, is tasked with saving their sister's life. It's a classic story made much more interesting by placing your character in a reality show environment. I got some real Hunger Games vibes from mingling with my fellow contestants and delivering interviews with my answers playing a role in whether or not I'd be going home or advancing to the next stage and it's this which is my main issue with this game. Although THP is a CYOA game and the choices, big and small, do indeed carry weight throughout the game it is pretty clear that the writer wants you to follow a set path. There is a theme running throughout the game of the oppression of the downtrodden and how as a member of the downtrodden, you could take it upon yourself to use your new reality show platform to reveal the true plight of your kind or, in theory, you can ignore this agenda and focus on helping your sister. Only you can't. Maybe I've not made the right choices but I was greeted by three game over screens (you can imagine my frustration after spending around an hour combing through the text and deliberating over my choices that I was told I'd failed and could either restart the whole game or sacrifice my legend score (a stat which tracks your hero's fame\/notoriety) to go back a few choices and try again. No checkpoints, no save state.) after trying to pick three different sets of choices which followed the beliefs I wanted my character to have (a straight-talking, private person with a soft spot for her sister. Her only motivation for going along with the contest being to help her however she could. She had no particular interest in any political message and was just there for family). On my fourth go at it, I decided to have my hero take a much more vocal approach to her thoughts on the political landscape just for the sake of trying to get past this one part and was rewarded by being allowed to progress through the game. I can only wonder why the option to not have a particularly strong opinion on the plight of 'ani-powered' heroes was included if you can't actually progress through the game by going down this route.<br><br>Although this decision by the writer has soured my opinion on this game, I still recommend it. At least to those familiar with the series. THP is a nice spin-off to the main HR series and it's pretty neat seeing decisions you made there coming back in some form here. The writing is great, characters are varied and memorable (JK is truly endearing) and this game will keep you hooked if you're a fan of the source material. If you're looking at this game and think it might be for you but haven't had the chance to play any of the other three then I highly recommend you look at those first. <br><br>Pros - <br>- Customisation. Name, codename, gender, sexual orientation, costume, sense of justice and more. Though do bear in mind that most of your potential enjoyment from this feature will come from your imagination. You can't choose your character's appearance or even something as basic as the colour of their hair but to me at least, that wasn't an issue. <br>- The ability to upload your save data from the main HR series (though this game will only take a completed save from the final part of the trilogy).<br>- An engaging story with twists and turns and memorable characters. JK, Weaver and a certain blast from the past definitely helped convince me to recommend this game.<br>- Some truly creative super powers.<br>- All of your stats are kept in one easy to find place where they can be readily referenced at any time.<br><br>Neutral -<br>- This is a text-only, CYOA game. There are no images and your enjoyment of this game will derive entirely from how much you enjoy reading and using your imagination.<br><br><br>Cons - <br>- Some illusion of choice. <br>- Hidden stats that affect whether you'll be able to progress through the game, get to try again at the cost of a huge chunk of your character's fame score or have to restart entirely from scratch resulting in you having to click through a bunch of text you've already read and typing in names that you've already written.<br>- Personally, I wasn't a fan of the main character's superpower. <br><br>\/\/\/SPOILER\/\/\/ You get to harness the abilities of a different animal every day. And also their appearance. You literally spend some of the game as a chicken man\/woman. And as a wheelchair bound bumblebee person. \/\/\/SPOILER\/\/\/<br><br>In summary, THP makes for some nice worldbuilding in the thoroughly enjoyable universe of Heroes Rise. If you've played that trilogy or will be playing it in preparation for playing this game then you're going to enjoy THP a lot more than you would if this was your first taste of the series. \u00a32.09 (until April 15th) for a very well written book that you can influence the outcome of is a very good deal indeed. Just give the main series a look first.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22308163', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22308163' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22308163\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22308163' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22308163\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22308163', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22308163_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22308163_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29604104\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rhysticone\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10335081\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e2b7bc73151e0cd660b66dae74e74935015faa7c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e2b7bc73151e0cd660b66dae74e74935015faa7c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e2b7bc73151e0cd660b66dae74e74935015faa7c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rhysticone\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10335081\">Rhystic_One<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rhysticone\/games\/?tab=all\">364 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rhysticone\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rhysticone\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs other reviewers suggest, this is probably the most &quot;politically charged&quot; book of the series.

So, here goes:<br><br>THP: Redemption Season is one of those games where I feel like it was expressly built to be part of a series. I see it as an introductory game in many ways - it introduces a huge number of characters and concepts, not the least of which being your own character. However, this often means there's a bit of information overload. Since it is, technically, a new series that builds off the old one, this is something veterans of the world will have to endure. Perhaps most prominently is the tone that is set by the author - your character is just scraping by financially and has experienced discrimination rather heavily. Whether that leads you to becoming an activist or a recluse (or neither, but you are rewarded for sticking to one path) is something you decide in game. Many of the people you interact with have been discriminated against in some way or another, and there's a lot of clashing subcultures and personalities. It makes for an interesting dynamic, though there are times in which, as other reviewers noted, this comes across as over the top (or in their words, preachy). Personally, it wasn't much of a big deal to me - I saw it more as representation and the author writing from the perspective of a disenfranchised main character. However, it is worth noting for other people who may be made uncomfortable with those sorts of things.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the game, the characters, and the writing, but like all things there are flaws that take away from the experience. I would certainly recommend THP: Redemption Season, but only with the warning that it is most definitely an introduction to this new series and can, at times, feel more like an introduction than a full game. Still, I am very excited for the next part, which should be coming out sometime early 2017.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23942643', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23942643' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23942643\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23942643' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23942643\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23942643', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23942643_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23942643_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22821194\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034051761\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"73786033\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034051761\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73786033\">kittywumpus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034051761\/games\/?tab=all\">148 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034051761\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198034051761\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the first time I've written a review for a game on Steam, but I just wanted to chime in about The Hero Project. I enjoyed the first trilogy, and I like Redemption Season so far as well. I want to encourage the writers and developers to keep on 'keepin' on' with this series.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>I enjoy the fact that you can carry over your character choices from game to game, and I like the fact that you can see the results of the first trilogy's events played out in Redemption.<br><br>I like the stat system and mechanics as well as the fact you don't have to grind stats as you do in some novel-style games. <br><br>The plot and setting are engaging, and the concept sparks my interest. <br><br>I picked up a Danielle Steele novel the other day and found it remarkably boring compared to the action-packed writing you have here, which could either be a testiment to the game's good writing or a reflection of my own warped taste.  <br><br>The concept behind the reader's character (their powers and background story) is interesting for me.<br><br>I am a long-time fan of choose your own adventure stories. I like being in control of the story's direction. Plus, it's like getting a bunch of different books all in one package.<br><br>I am pleased to see that the reality show producers are evolving as characters as well and have bigger goals, nobler purpose and more of a vision for the show than just to get the biggest ratings for the bang, so to speak. (I also like to see their failures and backfires and how they are learning from them.)<br><br>Even though I'm a pretty straight shooter when it comes to my romances, I like to see that this game has options, and a ton of them, for whatever orientation floats your boat.<br><br>Cons: <br><br>It's tough that you can't save and need to take the consequences of your choices (or accidental clicks) or start over, especially for someone like me who ends up duffing romance options because I'd rather save the world and succeed my way without compromising to accomodate the demands of a potential dating prospect. (Hope I didn't ruin my chances with Weaver because I voted one of his contestants off.)<br><br>There is a some heavy-handed material in this novel about social inequalities, discrimination and activism. Folks who like to read fantasy\/sci fi to get away from politics may want to steer clear. I don't mind it too much. Sometimes it gets a little 'in your face', but there are some good questions and points raised by the characters about these issues that could reflect on the issues of today. I would hate to see this trilogy evolve into a social studies lesson about human rights however. My preference is to keep those issues relevant, but not overshadowing the heroic adventures of the protagonist him\/her\/hir self. If the foreshadowing is any indication, however, it looks like the story may shift its focus soon anyhow.<br><br>Neither good nor bad:<br><br>This series, as the trilogy before it, forces you to make tough choices. There were times where I just couldn't decide what to do and had to leave the game for a while to think about it  before coming back with my decision. The consequences can be dramatic to the story and there's no going back except to start over, and I'm too cheap to spring for the hint MeChip thingy.  I like stories that make you think. It drives me bonkers when the consequences take the story in a direction I sincerely wish it hadn't, or come up with an ending I find disappointing because I made that one choice way back 25 choices ago. <br><br>Overall, I liked it, though. I like the characters. Some are flat and predictable, but some have unexpected surprises and layers of depth you weren't expecting until you choose to get to know them. It makes me want to use whatever system\/software they're using to create my own adventures.  The game itself is not that expensive, but I waited until it went on sale on Steam and picked it up. It cost a heck of a lot less than a book at the bookstore, and I feel I definitely got my money's worth. So thanks, creators and writers! Please continue to improve your stories and enhance your writing style. I, for one, want to see what happens next.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22821194', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22821194' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22821194\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22821194' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22821194\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22821194', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22821194_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22821194_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24812239\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Destont\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"319687543\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c9cc74eaf5a77b9dbe9f67551fc26267e4d7e6f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c9cc74eaf5a77b9dbe9f67551fc26267e4d7e6f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c9cc74eaf5a77b9dbe9f67551fc26267e4d7e6f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Destont\/\" data-miniprofile=\"319687543\">Destont<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Destont\/games\/?tab=all\">106 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Destont\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Destont\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just wanted to put a review here after finishing my first run of the game. The most important things I can think of saying here are that this entry in the heroes series does unltimately fit in with the heroes rise trilogy that cames before it. The biggest difference here is that it is perhaps a bit less subtle in the societal topics it deals with. Ultimately I would just like to say that I did enjoy this entry in the series and start of a new storyline set in the heroes universe.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24812239', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24812239' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24812239\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24812239' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24812239\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24812239', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24812239_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24812239_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22488245\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flamel93\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"160899222\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/db21ab81e77f3bca514c32542126c0b462025e4b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/db21ab81e77f3bca514c32542126c0b462025e4b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/db21ab81e77f3bca514c32542126c0b462025e4b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flamel93\/\" data-miniprofile=\"160899222\">flamel93<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flamel93\/games\/?tab=all\">18 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flamel93\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flamel93\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA great superhero game, because it's just as much about who you are as it is what you do - not all the paths branch too much, but I think that makes it all that more surprising when a small detail you often overlook ends up being SO much more important the next time you play through - 8\/10.

However in the end I found the prospect of a cameo from my hero, Specs, in a new series too hard to resist so I took the plunge and gave the redemption series a try. I am very glad I did.<br><br>strangely, depending on your perspective, this could be both the strongest and most flawed entry in the heroes rise series. After playing it I can certainly see why there is a split between positive and negative reactions. While the negative reviews are not without merit, I can safely say that the flaws they highlight are not as severe as they make it seem.<br><br>Let's get right into it: There are definitely author tracs in this game. Heroes Rise has always been a particularly progressive series and issues of discrimination and underrepresented persons are obviously very important to the author. While these themes have always been present in ther series,  In The Redemption Project, they are now a dominant element of the story. Fans who just want a superhero\/scifi adventure might find themselves disappointed with these political issues being so prominent this time. There's still plenty of superheroic action sequences and reality show drama to be enjoyed, but they now share equal stagetime with your character grappling these issues.<br><br>While these issues don't feel out of place, since the game has given you a main character who is practically guaranteed to have a reason to care about them at least a little, there are points where I couldn't help but feel the game was lecturing me a bit. These segments aren't nearly as jarring as when it happened in Heroes Rise: The Hero Project, but this is still a game that needs you to meet it halfway more then any of the others did since while in the previous series you had a rather typical comicbook superhero with a familiar backstory, this time you have a superhero with an unusual powerset that is also heavily disenfranchised. So even though your hero is still quite customizable, unless you are an underrepresented person yourself, you might find it'll take more effort on your end to care about your character and put yourself in their shoes than in the previous series. At least I found it took a little while for me, but once I did I became utterly hooked.<br><br>This game is bigger and longer then any of the previous in the series. The interesting, well developed characters that have a way of forcing you to care about them and hard decisions that I've come to expect from this series are all still here. (in fact I get the sense that the writer has actually improved quite a bit!) There were several times when I was faced with a decision that was so tough that I had to stop playing and leave my chair to really think about what I wanted my character to do, which has always been my favorite part of this series. The writing, characters, and the game's ability to present you with tough choices that make you second guess yourself after making them are the biggest strengths here and I found myself even more engaged by them then I was even in the previous series.<br><br>The biggest weakness has been touched on in other reviews, at a few points I had the game wagging its finger at me a bt regarding some of the choices I have made. One was when another character was explaining how they are forced to sacrifice their ideals to survive in the competition and I was presented with 2 previous &quot;bad&quot; choices my character could use to realize how him and this other character are alike, and 1 previous &quot;good&quot; choice that he could use to reflect on how he acted differently. The other instance was near the end where a character with similar ideals as my main character railed into me for falling short by voting the way I did in an elimination. For a game about choice it feels weird to be judged in this way, and I don't know if it was due to the choices I made early on but I definitely felt nudged in a certain direction, particularly when my character had an epiphany and became highly motivated to start breaking down barriers near the end of the game. Personally though I thought it was alot of fun for the game to confront me about my earlier decision like that. It was an opprotunity for my character to realize that while he is still confident that he made the right call, it was still very much not a perfect decision, and he is not perfect either. There are no easy answers here.<br><br>The bottom line is that I came into the Redemption Season expecting myself to not like it and I was very surprised to find that it is actually now my favorite of the entire series. If you are a fan of heroes rise I definitely recommend giving this one a shot, if only just to see if you end up liking it as much as I did. It's definitely a bold and different direction from the previous games but alot of what made them great is still here and I found myself warming up to the new elements as i got more invested in the story and the new main character. However, If you are new to the series, I recommend trying the previous trilogy first.<br><br>If this game is the first in the series, (I always feel the necessary introductory nature of first installments makes them particularly weak) then needless to say I am very excited.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24229993', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24229993' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24229993\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24229993' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24229993\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24229993', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24229993_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24229993_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22531698\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198058794579\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"98528851\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/84\/84c5dbf3ab569999f099c848339322d85bb377f6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/84\/84c5dbf3ab569999f099c848339322d85bb377f6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/84\/84c5dbf3ab569999f099c848339322d85bb377f6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198058794579\/\" data-miniprofile=\"98528851\">saarebutts<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198058794579\/games\/?tab=all\">424 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198058794579\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198058794579\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love the original trilogy and I love this continuation of the franchise. I dont usually write reviews but the negative reviews below made me want to offer a different perspective. The majority of the negative reviews only critisize the existance of marginalised groups being portrayed positively and an apparent &quot;social justice&quot; agenda. I don't know what they thought was going on when reading the original trilogy, but there has always been an anti-discrimination &quot;agenda&quot; in Heroes Rise. And I love it.<br><br>From the moment GG mentioned a Season 2 of THP, I wondered what would happen next. If you HAVE played the first three in this series, you know that the protaganist of those games fight against prejudice as an Infini Powered hero. I finished the trilogy having managed to bring &quot;anti-powered sentiment&quot; to an all time low and honestly felt a real sense of pride.<br><br>Thats what I like to see in fiction. Stories that make me FEEL. <br><br>The Hero Project: Redeption Season takes this to a new level. We saw in the Heroes Rise trilogy that there were many AniPowered heroes and villains who were vindicated for who they were. Most of them were the villains in this story. This is the first time we get to see from the other side. The first time you can REALY sympathise with what they go through. Before we only saw AniPowered through an outsiders eye. This time we get to experience what its like. We may not actually experience the painful transformations that our protaganist does, but their experiences are what drives this story.<br><br>Additionally, like the Heroes Rise trilogy, the LGBT+ representation is outstanding.

There is very little hero\u2019ing in this game, but a lot of talk about discrimination of the physically disabled. None of it is particularly subtle, and while it wasn\u2019t all that bad, I don\u2019t feel like ever reading through all of it ever again. <br><br>Which is a bit of a shame, because everything else is pretty damn neat. Your character is forced to make some pretty hard decisions, and I found myself quite attached to the persona I have crafted for the game. The story is engaging, and I certainly enjoyed it, even if it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. I certainly don\u2019t regret buying and reading it, and seeing how Zachary (the author) managed to cut down on the obvious preaching in Versus book that followed this one, I\u2019m looking forwards to the continuation of the series. <br><br>That being said, the author seriously needs to stop with the cliffhangers. The main plotline is nowhere near resolved by the end of the book, and we\u2019re already teased with the next main plotline. I guess it fits the theme (constant crises that plague every comic book series in existence), but it\u2019s getting a bit old by now.  I\u2019ll revisit this review later if the series jumps the shark, but for now, as stated earlier \u2013 a very careful recommendation. 6,5\/10<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28976350', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28976350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28976350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28976350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28976350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28976350', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28976350_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28976350_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28668041\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198072318455\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"112052727\">BeerForAll<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother amazing game in the HeroRise world.

In fact, if you have read the hero rise triology, you would find out that this particular author has always been incorporating ideas of social equality into his works. Only in the orginal triology, is about the powered and the non-powered, and in this story is about the ani-powered, and the other more acceptable powered. The former issue is easier to accepet, in fact a lot of superhero comics have been talking about it for quite a long time. The latter, however, is more like the homosexual marriage issue, to most people is not that big deal, and if you spend nearly all the time talking about it, people will be angry, like what we can see in the comment section.<br><br>But is this story worth recommending? I guess it is. Though the author always tries to preach his ideas about social justice, you can somehow still focused on saving your sister's life without giving your efforts away for some petty injustices. Although eventually you will be forced back to caring more for the ani-powered because your sister always has been an equality advocater, it wasn't awkward.

I will try to mention a few things.<br><br>Negetive;<br><br>The Decisions:<br>Is not as diverse in this game compared to the earlier three. Many of the 'negative' choices so to speak that existed in the earlier ones are not present here, even though some still do. Basicaly the game feels more linear then the other games, no matter how i play it dose not seem to affect me as much as it would have done in past games.<br><br>The Characters:<br>I'm not going to lie but the characters are very interesting..but very hard to see. Let me explain, in past games it was pretty easy to fantisize how the caracter looked like just from the brief descriptions of them, here that is not nearly enough, i'm personally almost unable to imagine how most of the characters look like, the descriptions mostly leaved me confused. <br>This can have many reasons but i think two things play in, the Author as well as the Setting, in this game you play the 'Weirdest of the Strangest' many of the characters are supposed to look weird and strange to the degree that is is hard to describe them...sadly i think the author simply has taken bite too big to chew, maybe someone with more experiance when it comes to describing aperences could have offered help.<br><br>Possitive;<br><br>The characters:<br>As hard it is to imagine the characters apearences, they are still very interesting, especilly the main characters (as in you, the player, and the main characters sister!) and the situation\/scenario you are stuck in. Also the fact that the main character constantly changes powers is an interesting twist, in the other games you quickly got used to using some powers (and thus became better at using them) you where more sure on what strategy to use and far your powers could take you, not as sure any longer in this game, making it both harder and more intense not being sure how powerfull\/powerless and Stable\/unstable your powers are.<br>It's fun..and hard at the same time, a good twist!<br><br>The Story:<br>Is not as awesome as in the other games, but still really good! An interesting twist that the main character is now a part of the Lower Class, adding a lot more of the 'Class Struggle\/War' into the scenario! I only wish you had added more of that into the game, maybe they will in comming episodes, i hope! More class-struggle!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25369589', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25369589' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25369589\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25369589' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25369589\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25369589', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25369589_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25369589_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24608626\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198287250195\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"326984467\">brianlaffey<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 68.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOverall: a jarring but interesting departure from the first three Hero Rises books that some may find and intriguing if overally preachy. Takes a while to find its footing.<br><br>Details: as a huge fan of the original trilogy, I immediately bought Redemption Seaon. Although it drops you into the action, a large amount of text slows you down considerably at the start. As you slog through some exciting sequences, the action then stops to a crawl and continues so for a while as the author not only introduces you to the new characters but bashes over the head ad naseum with the book's take on prejudice against certain aspects of the  superhuman community (Ani's, Disembodied, Morphs, and in general those who don't look like your standard Greek god\/goddess).<br><br>What should be an interesting new viewpoint from the more standard (if fun and glamorous) superhero fare of the first trilogy and build a strong foundation instead blankets the story in a heavy weight. I kept waiting for the lecturing to stop and the plot \/action to begin. That, along with a long wait before you can start individlualizing your character and a constantly changing power set\/appearance, led to a disconnect between myself and viewpoint character that led me to put the book down for over a month.<br><br>The action is much lighter with far fewer battles than the earlier books but what is there works well enough. The exception is a well-written final battle that raises the stakes, introduces unique villains, and instills a sense of dread. It's over too quickly and easier than anticipated but these are minor quibbles give its otherwise slick execution. Hopefully we will see more action in the sequel.<br><br>The book is best when it focuses away from its heavy reliance on the heavy-handed prejudice storyline to focus on the characters who well drawn and layered. Even the final badguys have a shocking backstory twists that paints them and the theme of prejudice in a new light. <br><br>I would also criticize the early attempt to force your character to take a strong stance one way or another. By not doing so, I was eliminated early despite doing reasonably well in the competition. It discourages readers from exploring who their character might be and might become as they learn about their new storyline. In trying to stand out early, you may (as I did) define your character in a way that you will later regret.<br><br>Final Summary: the book is a frankenstein of sorts: half Prodigy and half Hero Project. It suffers from a very slow setup in the beginning and only partial progression through the title's &quot;Redemption Season.&quot; Although it has a strong climax, that the new season of the Hero Projection has far to go may be unsatisfying for some. The GOOD news is that it sets up for a better second book, just as the fine Hero Rises Prodigy set the stage for the even better Hero Project. Also, while the plot is slow with a heavy-handed theme, the characters are as interesting and enthralling as ever. <br><br>A 6.5\/10 with an anticipated higher score for the next book in the series.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24608626', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24608626' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24608626\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24608626' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24608626\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24608626', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24608626_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24608626_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24512504\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022095267\/recommended\/459310\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"61829539\">AericcOnline<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter reading throught the other reviews, I saw a lot of negative for the writer's thoughts on issues.

I spent a good chunk playing all of the first trilogy only to be told my choices didn't matter if I have a file from the first game?

I've only played a few, but these are among the best storytelling I've ever seen, no matter the media.<br>Second, I played the Heroes Rise trilogy, and I loved every moment of it. So I had rather high expectations about Redemption Season, as the sequel to one of my new favorite licence.<br><br>And I was kind of scared, seeing this only rated as &quot;Variable&quot; (in French), compared to the other games, which all have received really good reviews.<br><br>I just completed my first run, achieving almost the best score of Legend possible, and I'll most certainly replay it.<br><br>I get why so many peoples seems disappointed in this episode. ** minor spoiler here ** As some said, the game revolve heavily around the segregation among the Powered, and mostly toward Ani Powered, Morpho Powered and Disembodied. And some find you actually barely see it in game. I completely agree. Though, it's a logical and good narrative choice. Inside of the Hero Project, heroes are secluded and receive as less as possible informations from the &quot;outer world&quot; (like in most reality show). It's actually only logical, that you can't go on the streets and see this by yourself. ** end of spoiler **<br><br>As usal, the narrative is extremely good, the story really got me to actually care deeply for characters, a thing that happens more than often with Choices of Game, and particularly Heroes Rise. So far, in my opinion, it's the storyline that offer exchanges with the most characters (and they're all unique and deep). I'm kind of discouraged by some aspects of the story, for personnal reasons. As such, would I rate it as my favorite narrative game? No. The first trilogy of Heroes Rise is still too fresh to let its place goes. But it's by far one of the best I played (as a text based game), and a top tier game in general (still in my opinion, obviously).<br><br>Plus side: if you've played the first trilogy, many informations about what has been going on behind the scene can be foud here and there. To me, it explained a lot of situations I found rather dubious, and seems a bit more logical now. If you have one, I highly recommand to load one of your previous game, seeing the consequences of your choices and getting news from your previous self (and his\/her group) is really a plus.<br><br>9\/10 to me (Heroes Rise as a whole being a 10\/10.
