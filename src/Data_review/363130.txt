Either way, review time.<br><br><b>You should probably buy Toukiden 2 instead.<\/b><br><br>This game ain't bad. However, Toukiden 2 is superior to it in every single aspect, so if you're looking for a monster hunter experience on PC, you definitely should go and grab toukiden 2. It is much, much, much, much, much better than this title. <br><br>Now, if you're dead set on buying this game and not Toukiden 2....<br><br>Have you ever heard the saying &quot;being pecked to death by a duck?&quot;. Well, in this game you're that duck. You spent majority of time fighting large bosses, and each of them is a HP sponge that barely reacts to your pitiful attempts to hurt it. So you chip away at their health slowly. Very slowly. Now, I've seen much worse HP sponges (in Planet Explorers, for example), but fights tend to get tedious. Titles like Dark Souls or Neir automata have much more satisfying combat system. <br><br>Pros:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Characters are nice. They're likeable.<br><\/li><li>Design of the bosses is interesting (even though there are reskins of bosses), and major bosses come with their own unique musical themes.<br><\/li><li>When your reach second part - where it is &quot;kiwami&quot;, the story greatly improves. Armor design also improves as well. There are truly amazing (visually) outfits in the second part of the game.<br><\/li><li>There's a great deal of interesting 2d art and historical backgrounds for &quot;Mitama&quot; heroes. They all are voiced too (as in they have few lines to say)<br><\/li><li>Fairly complex ability system that allows complicated min\/maxing.<\/li><\/ul><br>Cons:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Performance is not good. It is either 2 or 4 times slower than Toukiden 2 on my machine.<br><\/li><li>It can get really dull. At the later fights I picked up rifle, and let the teammates handle most of the fighting, because I wanted to see the ending.<br><\/li><li>Story in the first half of the game (which corresponds to &quot;Age of Demons&quot;) is somewhat slow-paced. on occasion it looks very uneventful.<br><\/li><li>It gets really grindy if you want to clear all sidequests (I'm looking at you, Tatara the blacksmith, and your &quot;Upgrade equipment chest&quot; quest), or if you want to build specific armor sets. Some quests rely on random or semi-random drops, and in-game encyclopedia does not really allow you to select an item from some list and see where it can be found (like in Atelier Sophie). Instead, you need to walk through lists of areas and lists of defeated monsters to see if they drop the item you want or not, or use online wiki. This is not very convenient.<\/li><\/ul><br>Misc:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It is a Koei Tecmo PC port. With all the related consequences. <br><\/li><li>you're going to need a controller. Then again this days having a controller even for PC is fairly common.<br><\/li><li>Visuals aren't going to win any awards either. Everything for some reason has that weird Grayish\/brownish washed out pallete, even though environments apparently were supposed to look dreamlike or &quot;fantastic&quot;.<br><\/li><li>The game is centered around several fairly large maps (I think seven of them), which are composed out of small zones connected via a loading screen. Over the course of the game, you'll be revisitng those. A LOT.<\/li><\/ul><br>So, there's that. <br><br>Basically, it is not a game that will capture your heart and soul, but something you coudl be playing for months in your spare time to unwind. It is combat + grinding + lots and lots and lots of quests, collectibles, armors sets you can build, etc. In a sense, it is somewhat similar to item farming mechanics seen in Atelier Sophie and Neptunia.<br><br>You decide whether this is what you want or not.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30825590', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30825590' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30825590\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30825590' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30825590\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30825590', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30825590_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30825590_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>13 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30346142\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272538113\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"312272385\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/15\/15eb6edf4fc7301c7a325cc2ff7dd4f375a654f4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/15\/15eb6edf4fc7301c7a325cc2ff7dd4f375a654f4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/15\/15eb6edf4fc7301c7a325cc2ff7dd4f375a654f4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272538113\/\" data-miniprofile=\"312272385\">PrincessCarwash\u6d17\u8eca\u59eb<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272538113\/games\/?tab=all\">282 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272538113\/recommended\/\">38 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198272538113\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t*_* It's not Monster Hunter, but if u close yr eyes and dream, it's rly close!!

I pretty much guessed it will be buggy and pricey. so I grabbed it 6 months later after patches were made. at 50% off.<br><br>Buy this game if:<br>+You like Japanese setting<br>+You like monster hunter<br><br>Do not buy this game if:<br>-You don't have controller<br>-You only have low end PCs<br>-You don't want 30fps<br>-You expect an English voice over<br><br>Performance: 7\/10 (for my rig)<br>This is a good game, but not so good port. If you play using keyboard, it'll be really uncomfortable especially if you haven't played any monster hunter games. I had to use &quot;Joy To Key&quot; in order to have my PC controller work, It's sad that I had to rely on third party program but I still enjoyed the game. I had to play with the settings and graphics card settings a little bit to get the best result I can get. So if you expect to play it right away, you might get disappointed. I am giving this a positive review because the game performance is working perfectly to me other than the controller support and the game itself is pretty good. don't hate my review just because it's not working for you, that's why you have your review, and I have mine.<br><br>Gameplay: 7\/10<br>It is monster hunter. period. just slightly different mechanics with MH.<br>before the edit, this is what I said in the review:<br>&quot;This is more easier than any of the monster hunter game, you can take your time picking up loots while your NPC party pretty much beat up every monster in the game and then &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;. I'm not against about party, but I don't feel good enough when slaying bosses because it's not giving you any monster hunter sensation like few mistakes could affect the entire battle. Gameplay is Monster hunter with smash button.&quot;<br>It really is easy as pie for the first few chapters, but the real challenge starts in chapter 6, where the mission will actually give you some thrill. I would give it 8.5 rating for the gameplay, but the fact that this is copied from monster hunter kind of affected its originality. so it deserves a 7.<br><br>Story: 8\/10<br>If it comes with plot and story, I think this is where Toukiden beats Monster Hunter. It gives you more pressure or urgency to go forward to find out what's gonna happen next. pretty solid turn of events, every protagonist has their own story and challenges to overcome. Each one has too much worries, pride, anger, regret, guilt, and insecurities that even a physically strong person can be mentally weak.<br><br>Art: 7\/10<br>Is good. Character designs are remarkable. <br>this is what I said before the edit: &quot;Atmosphere is okay but it looks dense to me especially the backgrounds, it looks low poly and textures are lazy. They spent a lot of time on characters, monster and items, but fk the backgrounds in particular.&quot;<br>It is still kind of true, but I've come to notice that polygons aren't so bad for the backgrounds. it's just the textures, lacks of contrast and resolution. the desert looks pretty good though. so, yeah, Characters are remarkable but fk the backgrounds in particular.<br><br>Sound and Voice: 9\/10<br>They hired the most talented VAs, It's in Japanese but I'd prefer it 10 times over a not so good English. Music is great, fits the setting perfectly.<br><br>Over all: 7.6\/10 (7.5 before edit)<br><br>I am happy with the game. Great game but not so good port. If it wasn't for controller support and performance tweak, I could have given it higher review.<br>for those who are wanting a mouse support for this game, the game would easy as a kids game(It's already the easy version of MH, what more do you want), hence, unfair for console version of the game. you know who complains about mouse support? someone who probably hasn't played any rpg game in console or FPS pc gamer.<br> I like the way it is now.<br><br>PS: potato is life.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20344215', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20344215' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20344215\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20344215' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20344215\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20344215', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20344215_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20344215_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t65 of 81 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29933174\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"97334655\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e4fd1c5699adbcdb9c96909c2b56e01f42b850a3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e4fd1c5699adbcdb9c96909c2b56e01f42b850a3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e4\/e4fd1c5699adbcdb9c96909c2b56e01f42b850a3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/\" data-miniprofile=\"97334655\">greatyoubrokeit<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/games\/?tab=all\">361 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatyoubrokeit\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">172.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bad reviews are mostly because <br>- This game had a rough launch. <br>- Mouse\/keyboard support is unacceptable and basicaly makes it unplayable unless you have a gamepad. <br>- 30 fps lock (I could care less if the game looks good and is entertaining)<br>- Monster Hunter fans upset over seeing this carbon copy of the franchise.<br>- People thinking it's repetetive and grindy. (Thats the point of this genre)<br>- People hate reading subs (There is no English dub)<br><br><br>Now that that is out of the way, lets get to the good stuff. <br><br>This isn the most shameless recreation of a monster hunter game ever made (moreso than Freedom Wars, Soul Sacrifice, Godeater, etc...) and I mean that in the best way possible. Lets face it, MH fans had nothing on PC. Sony just took the opportunity since Capcom has been holding the MH series over the burning building that is Nintendo for the past few years. For the record I think both Nintendo and Sony are horrible companies, so I have no bias there. I'm here to enjoy myself, not pick sides between companies that give two \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about me and only care about my wallet. I can care less who came up with the ideas first if someone starts doing it smarter, And that is capitalism (at least what it's SUPPOSED to be)<br><br>I'd recommend this if:<br>- You like Monster Hunter games, or others like it.<br>- You like the combat mechanics in Dark Souls, Dragons Dogma,<br>- You don't mind grinding boss fights for badass armor\/weapon rewards.<br>- You have a few mates to co-op with.<br>- You're into Jrpg's and want to try something similar.<br><br>And that's kinda it. Unfortunately, this genre isn't one with a very large audience, and thats what makes this such a treat. There aren't enough games like this because it's a risky investment, especially when Capcom sits on the MH throne dominating it. I agree this game had a lot of problems, and it still does. But, I'm also really glad Sony decided to port this (If you can call this halfa** job a port) because it means not only that PC gamers can have more of this genre, but I think it's very likely that Toukiden coming to PC will cause MH to come to PC as well, especially if it does well. <br><br>If you're into this sorta game, definitely get it. It's one of the better ones.<br>If you're on the fence, wait for Toukiden 2 (March 21 2017 for PC release) It will be more fleshed out, and has open world and all those goodies. Hopefully they'll put some f***ing effort into porting it next time.<br><br>Anyway I'm definitely gonna support the hell out of this, even if it has its flaws. I've been a huge MH fan since the original, but I won't shame a good game for copying a good thing. Plus, IM TIRED OF MONSTER HUNTING ON A LITTLE 3DS! Come on Capcom...<br><br>10\/10 If you're my clone. <br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29933174', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29933174' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29933174\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29933174' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29933174\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29933174', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29933174_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29933174_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t85 of 117 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18444215\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ScottWhatSolo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"165066896\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1b97e72257248bcd790e99cdd022852b1016c1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1b97e72257248bcd790e99cdd022852b1016c1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3f\/3f1b97e72257248bcd790e99cdd022852b1016c1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ScottWhatSolo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"165066896\">ScottWhatSolo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ScottWhatSolo\/games\/?tab=all\">1,838 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ScottWhatSolo\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ScottWhatSolo\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">76.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 12, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI get some people are having problems getting this game to run and I know it had some issues on launch but this happens with so many PC games. <br>Koei sorted out what was needed yet they still get ripped hard in the forums and through reviews its unneeded and misdirected. <br>This game is great its a monster hunter for pc but with Koei's touch.<br><br>Pros - <br>- Controls with a Xbox remote are tight and responsive. <br>- Gameplay is addictive, slay a monster or monsters level up your weapons, amour then back out for a new hunt. <br>- A nice amount of amour and weapons to pick from and the attention to detail with this stuff makes every piece completely different. <br>- Can change the way you play by picking a new weapon set.<br>- Graphics are nice its just your standard Koei look but if you turn your TV brightness down makes everything seem more intense. <br>- Story is spot on not to weak and not in your face a nice way to break up to constant war with the oni. <br>- Multiplayer I haven't scoped out but im sure its all sweet. <br>- The music is nice it hasent become repetitive, you end up so focused on the mission at hand you only really have time to appreciate it once your back in the village. <br>- So many missions.<br><br>Cons- <br>- Should have split screen, I feel this really wouldn't of been hard to whack in.<br>- No difficulty, wish there was more of a reason to re-do old hunts other than for fun.  Its in most of there games would have really enjoyed cranking mission 1 on intense difficulty and feeling that pressure.<br>- Scoreboards even if not online but just for yourself, it would have been glorious going back to old levels and trying to beat old times set when you was weak. <br>- Actually character leveling, the weapons and amour is a nice way to level but would of added some more depth if we could pick add +2 to defense or attack if our base character leveled up but still not a massive issue. <br>- English dub, im all cool reading the story but it is a little bit lazy leaving it out but if this is the only way Koei can re-release these things on pc then im all good with that. <br><br>Overall <br><br>Its an addictive just 1 more hunt sort of game, once you fight your first epic oni you just cant wait to see what the next one could be. I would say its well worth 40 but not for everyone most would see this as a hemp game with a consistent grind but you could say that about any game ever made.<br>Buy it don't be fooled by the bad reviews. <br>If your on the fence and unsure whether it'll work just head over to canyourunit and they will sort your worries out. <br>Even with its cons they just don't seem that bad because the game is so good!<br><br>9\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18444215', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18444215' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18444215\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18444215' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18444215\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18444215', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18444215_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18444215_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24154530\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"33805995\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b47d8a3b45ce9b290e18f6672de1d24724087de.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b47d8a3b45ce9b290e18f6672de1d24724087de.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b47d8a3b45ce9b290e18f6672de1d24724087de_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33805995\">Nenilai<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/games\/?tab=all\">114 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nenilai\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">25.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIGNORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS - Read the bottom of this to see why ...   This game is GENIUS, I love it, This deserves to become more popular and get bigger, from the creators of Dynasty warriors , this even outdoes their other games. I really thought this was a weak monster hunter clone at first, it unlocks everything allot later into the game, so at first it seems very empty and featureless... But after you play for a while you'll see it has a HUGE amount of content, I'll even list them.<br><br><br>FEATURES:<br><br>- Good Character Customization - Easily Equal to Monster Hunter full RGB hair color, lots of hairstyles faces etc, no body Build or size sliders but characters still look good, Voices are all Japanese and sound pretty cool as you do moves ingame.<br><br>- Incredible Fighting System , Dynasty warriors style with Ultimate Attacks and Team Ultimate attacks, Love it.<br><br>- Pet system - And its not a Pig like in Monster Hunter!, finally! - Change Clothing, Color, Voice, etc, your pet can even resurrect you in battle and gather items for you.<br><br>- Romances - LGBT friendly even, gain affection from many characters with no discrimination, and hot tub romance em.<br><br>- Weapon And Armor Crafting and Upgrading - Similar to Monster Hunter Games with allot of extras on the weapons because of the soul weapon system.<br><br>- Customizable Spirit Weaponry - Feel like a Shinigami with a Zanpakuto weapon talking to you lol for Bleach fans.<br><br>- Incredible Friendly AI - Some of the best friendly\/team unit AI I've seen in any game period, maybe too strong, they can do it all for you, and follow orders like elite soldiers flawlessly... The monsters I feel need an AI boost, they are strong but not as smart as your team.<br><br>- Command Units - Later on you get to command followers and send them on missions as well as take them on yours, while using united super attacks and bonding with some romantically.<br><br>- Real Lore - The spirits in this game are real people from Japanese lore just like the Heroes from Dynasty Warriors... love these guys for doing this!. If you do your homework and know the connection between characters the spirits even get bonus combinations!.<br><br>- Nice Music - Enjoyable Soundtrack with lots of Japanese themes that adjusts to the mood of gameplay and stops when combat starts, Oni spotted, emotions run High or low etc<br><br>- LOTS of story - Cinematic story that goes on for Hours, (so far among my friends its over 50+ hours RPG style, and thats with one who plays constantly and doesn't work) very long campaign, you'll have tons to do, with even more DLC content... The story makes you feel like the main character and hero of an anime saga , and you have to make decisions often that will decide if you are loved or hated by the characters you spend time with.<br><br>- Training System is good for new players to hunter style games, it explains the moves very well. With training rooms that you can test out every single weapon and practice rooms that you can cut loose in.<br><br>CONS:<br><br> - Easy Gameplay : Personally I havent seen much challenge to this game yet, at the very least my friends who play and enjoyed monster hunter have been alittle bored with the monster strength, but theres still more gameplay to see, maybe they get harder later...<br><br>- DLC armor cant be customized and you cant wear one piece or another, just the entire set, wich ruins any fun of mixing and matching... but at least you get set bonuses I guess.. = \\<br><br>- Missing translations - This actually annoys me, certain parts of the game especially character phrases in combat are not translated. Even characters you romance you wont know what they're saying in combat.. even if its about you... = (<br><br>- Simple Weaponry - Weapons don't get exotic and fancy, no energy blades or swords on fire, etc. As far as I've seen and looked up, the weapons stay plain.<br><br>- Unbalanced Weapons - This was probably designed for Team Play but some weapons just don't allow jump attacks, like the Katana, and Fists\/Gauntlets, so you need friends or AI to hit the upper monster parts... not good, would highly recommend changing that.<br><br>Technical Issues:<br><br>WARNING - There are issues the Negative reviews are true, so before you enjoy please understand there are some problems.<br><br>1 - Theres a framerate bug, theres a setting in the launcher all the way on the rightmost tab that stabilizes this so it runs well again. And the game must run in fullscreen, if not, you will suffer a weird 30 fps cap... this needs be fixed, but as long as your in Fullscreen and have the setting enabled, you'll be fine.<br><br>2 - You need a controller... sorry to say this has some of the worst Keyboard controls I've ever seen.... it was designed for controller play, and really doesn't give any mercy.<br><br>3 - Very Japanese, traditional olschool music, sounds, characters, names, everythings subtitled, except some mid battle phrases, so be sure you love Japanese culture allot. And know a few words here and there.<br><br>4 - Multiplayer has 2 modes, English and ALL, if you select ALL, and your friends are on ENGLISH, you will never be able to connect to them... without any error or warning, this plus the lack of story in Multiplayer has made it pretty empty most of the time in Multiplayer, If you want to support the game , please host some Multiplayer games.<br><br><br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Worth buying this game!, On sale though, $60 is too much with all the technical issues honestly... but you will enjoy it if you give it time, especially if you love anime, Japanese culture, Koei\/W-Force , Want something that will keep you busy for a long time with lots of story. Looking for a different feel from Monster Hunter style games etc. Just be flexible and keep it fullscreen, and only play if you have a controller. Avoid if you don't like story or are only going to play for the multiplayer experience. You need to do story in this, and that is the best experience. Besides that have fun.

You must have a controller to play, it doesn't even recognize a mouse. It's frame capped at 30fps, less than we PC gamers are used to. It has some issues with nVidia cards that require a work around. But even with all that, I'm having a blast!<br><br>I've played Monster Hunter on 3DS a few times, and loved the game in concept but really wanted it on a bigger screen with a better controller (I don't enjoy playing on handhelds personally.) Not owning a Wii or PS4, there weren't many options. Toukiden has been everything I could want there, in fact I enjoy the game itself more than Monster Hunter, mechanically and for the fact it does have some basic story involved.<br><br>So if you're in a situation like I was, wanting a monster hunter style game on PC, and own a controller, absolutely jump in.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16949465', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16949465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16949465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16949465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16949465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16949465', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16949465_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16949465_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22886993\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"86959938\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6abf9b657f66ba3cb1fe8a6dbf0a0f3f63694bb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6abf9b657f66ba3cb1fe8a6dbf0a0f3f63694bb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6abf9b657f66ba3cb1fe8a6dbf0a0f3f63694bb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/\" data-miniprofile=\"86959938\">Brawph<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/games\/?tab=all\">668 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047225666\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">53.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a monster hunter and Dark Souls fan, this game is worth it.<br><br>While, on its face, one might readily assume it to be a Monster Hunter Clone ported to PC, there's a lot more to this game than that. <br><br>Saying this is a &quot;just&quot; a Monster Hunter clone is like saying Pillars of Eternity is &quot;just&quot; a Baldur's Gate clone. When, in reality, both of those games are building on the series they reference by adding new mechanics and systems and building on the game design. <br><br>Rifles for example have been given more mechanics and interesting choices than Monster Hunter bowguns. Along with there also being bows. The entire Mitama system of Spirits and their special abilites adds a lot of choices and ways to augment the game to your playstyle too!<br>Or how monsters usually have more than half a dozen breakable locations that impact play, and leave parts on the ground for you to try to collect (or else risk the monster healing a bit if you don't get them in time).<br><br>--Quality of Life Changes--<br><br>There are numerous quality of life changes like a WAY easier time gathering materials (no more farming the same monster 50 or 60 times to get that last rare drop). <br><br>One of the best changes is the Slayer vision, a sight mode you can turn on that drains your stamina (used for dodging and attacking) but reveals how damaged different monster parts are -- showing how close they are to being knocked off for harvesting (or carves in MH... though way more often than carves). This vision also shows you total monster health so you can always check if you're close to killing it or have a while to go and can focus on getting a few more parts. (Making this have a direct drawback of reducing your ability to attack and dodge is a nice counter balance in their design so players can't use it all the time)<br><br>There's lots of little changes to help, like not having to pick up the map as you enter the area, not having to waste time or money on paintballing things or chasing it between zones to deal with it. It's more focused on the fun of the combat when you're out on a hunt. <br><br>You also get an adorable fox creature that you can send off to scavange areas for you to find crafting items. Later in the game you also get command of a second squad to send out to farm monster materials for you as well!<br><br>Additionally, in MH, you could end up being screwed by having a weird party size, three people ended up being worse than solo because you lost access to the cats. This game fixes issues like that by letting you take AI party members with you (who have real stories and are interesting characters in their own right). OR you can choose to go it alone and not take them with you if you'd rather not!<br><br>--Difficulty--<br><br>One reviewer called this game &quot;too easy&quot; which, as a long time Souls and Monster hunter fan, I disagree with. I'd say it's approachable early on, but anyone who's played Monster Hunter knows that the begining of the game monsters are just the warm up, if you're interested in harder things, keep going to get higher tier monsters and armor and higher level versions of creatures. Like in MH there's 3 different difficulties for most monsters, and some monsters don't appear in earlier points in the game! Just remember that you only have to do the missions written in *Red* to progress to the next chapter. You don't have to do every single hunt to continue in the story or get to higher tier enemies and things (but you can always come back later if you want to)<br><br>--Story--<br><br>Lastly, the storyline is a lot more interesting and engaging than one would ever expect coming from the Monster Hunter series. You feel like you've been dropped into an anime series where you're a principle character engaging with these interesting people and finding out about their strengths, flaws, interpersonal interactions, learning their quirks... and you progress towards a real goal that seems important and pushes and tests the characters involved to grow and become better people.<br><br>--Porting--<br><br>This game gets a lot of flak for porting issues, and I think a lot of the problems arise based on people using Windows 10. That said, Dark Souls 1 had horrendous porting issues too, and while that was an issue for some, it didn't stop people from enjoying the game. Dark Souls still has great reviews because people were willing to see past the port and rate it based on the GAME itself. <br><br>If you choose not to play this because of percieved porting issues, you're cutting off your nose to spite your face, you're missing out on a great experience for what might be a minor inconcenience -- I haven't found any issues with porting myself and think a lot of the whining comes from the &quot;OMFG 60 FPS or GTFO&quot; crowd. Most of us don't see the difference or care when it doesn't affect play.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22886993', 'summary' );

aswell as the usage of a (XBox-)controller, because it's nearly unplayable without one.<br><br> It also has a 30 FPS-lock. Just try out if you can play it properly and, if not, refund it before you played more than 2 hours, but don't expect to get a deep insight to the game in those 2 hours. <\/i><\/b><br><br><i>English is not my first language, sorry.<\/i><br><br>I'm playing with a friend and we are in the Coop-Chapter 14-15 right now. At first the game was easy (but sometimes hard too, we're just into these games) enough to be played alone or as two hunters only, but later the ultimate-difficulty is pretty cool if you're looking for some more action, especially with those newer monsters. Reaching that point you should consider to play with the really good bots the game offers or some more friends ... or you will have very, very tough fights, foremost if you want to beat some of the special-missions and survivals with more than 20 killed big monsters. Also you should practise to dodge attacks, because many of them will hurt you very much or even onehit you when you're playing as a glasscannon.<br><br>The story of Toukiden is not that bad and I really liked the dialogues &amp; the characters - no problems with some stereotypes from my side here. Especially Toukiden: Kiwami (the Addon) tries to be more cinematic and changes the town a bit more, but I didn't finish the story yet so I can't and won't say more.<br><br>If you're looking for a 1:1-Monster Hunter-clone, you don't find it here. The focus of Toukiden is the bossfight itself, not the hunt. You won't place traps and lure the big monsters et cetera, because they will wait for you - ready for battle - most of the times, and I don't think that's even bad. <br><br>Each of the 9 available weapons feels very different in combat and can be played for damage &amp; crit, elemental damage or special effects like DoT or CC. Well, most of the costumization for your playstyle lies in the choice of your Mitama: These noble souls will have different abilities for you to use, like teamsupport or speciality in destroying of the monster's bodyparts, and later on you can combine three of them to form your own playstyle with. There are 300 of them to get and each of them has a little backroundstory (actually real persons like in Samurai Warriors\/Dynasty Warriors) and a different japanese voice &amp; picture. Not sure if anyone else likes to collect interesting stories and nice artworks while getting new possibilites in the game too, but I like it.<br><br>Well, I like this game alot, but you should rather play it with a friend than alone, because some parts are - that's a part of this genre anyway - grind-intensive, even more later on. The less you grind new armors and weapons, the more you will get into trouble if you skip missions to enter new chapters ... I mean: Of course you can do that, but don't expect <u>not<\/u> to be a onehit for everyone then! Generally the weapons will have a much higher impact on your chances of success than armor, as long as you can dodge.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22855260', 'summary' );

I recommend the Xbox One controller simply because it works on PC without any special software.    Most of the bad reviews I've seen were because the person didn't have a controller. That's not to say this is going to appeal to everyone.  But I can't imagine anyone without a controller liking this game.<br><br>I'm recommending this game.  Why?<br>Simply put, this is as close to Monster Hunter you're going to get from a PC game.  There are a lot of similarties.  Mostly the game works pretty well in the same way Monster Hunter works.<br><br>Difficulty:<br>It's not as difficult because the controller scheme is much more simple.  You don't use the analog sticks to swing your weapons like in the original Monster Hunter.  It's also easier because the monsters (I've played the first 3 chapters) are just not as deadly - at least in offline solo play.  But you get to a point with the large monsters that it's challenging enough that you'll bring other group members.<br><br>Grouping:<br>You can group with NPCs in offline mode, or you can group with real players in online mode.<br>Max group size is 4.<br>In solo mode, the NPCs will run the mission while you just stand there, until you find a large\/boss monster.<br><br>Weapons &amp; Armour:<br>All the gear is from Japanese history\/lore.  It's Japanese themed.  If that's ok, you'll like the game.  If not, go find another game.  <br><br>Upgrading:<br>Like in Monster Hunter you have to carve off (or in the case of this game do a purification ritual to pick up) pieces of monsters in order to get gear crafted.  You don't craft it yourself.  You take it to the village blacksmith and he crafts and upgrades it for you.  To get the better gear, you have to fight the harder monsters.<br><br>Weapon 'sockets':<br>Weapons have sockets.  You put souls of fallen heroes that you find inside those sockets.  That's how you get access to special abilities.  You get a lot of these souls and they all have a specific style and specific bonuses.  For example, if you want to be 'a tank' then you go with a defender soul and  you can then put it in any weapon.  The weapon does not determine your role.  But there are definite advantages to different types of weapons based on what style you choose.<br><br>Story: <br>It's not completely baffling like a lot of Japanese games I try to play.  It took me a while to get into the story.  But once I did, it got to be engaging.<br><br><br>Cons:<br>The one thing I don't love about the game is that the boss fights aren't (yet) deadly enough.  They can take a long time but that's mostly because the bosses have a ton of hit points. But it's not tedious and boring like Dragon's Dogma.  I feel like the bosses should be able to punish mistakes a lot more readily.  They should be able to wipe a stupid party (i'm thinking of Land and Sky from Monster Hunter.)  But this is a minor con.  I am a huge Dark Souls fan, and enjoy punishing games.  This game is just not like that.  At least not in solo mode.<br><br>Overall, I recommend this game because it's fun.  It's not perfect.  It's 3.5 or 4 out of 5.  But I haven't stopped playing it for a couple of days.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29892496', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29892496' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29892496\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29892496' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29892496\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29892496', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29892496_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29892496_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29662702\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198117392687\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"157126959\">Blackcatgamer<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tToukidden Kiwami<br>It is a Four player co op game in the similar fashion of Monster hunter series while i can see the core game play in Toukidden but it does throw in a few ways to slow down the demons in the game cuting off they legs and arm but that doesnt keep them down for long. <br><br>Now a probmle for none japan lovers this game is set in the Furdel area of Japan so expect to see nothing but samurai  armor and Weps. <br><br>Its full japanese Voiced which in the pasted I hated games like this but here it works well instead of taking away in deepends me into the story.<br>and you can use Spirits of fallen warriors who have died and had they souls eaten.

You must be thinking ARE YOU FOR REALZ m8?!?!? *insert butwhy.gif here* Now I'll get back to you with that down below.  If you don't mind the 30 fps lock then get this game during a sale ;) I wouldn't recommend buying it full price that's just insaiyan!<br><br>The gameplay is pretty much like god eater and monster hunter. You can pick a mission set up your equipment and upgrade them , the weapon looks awesome in this game. The combat is pretty good , you can feel the impact of hitting an enemy and you can destroy body parts from bosses in this game its just so satisfying. The story is not bad and the character is ehem...&quot;interesting&quot; to say the least *wink wink*. Oh yes the character in this game speak japanese with english sub. I'm not sure if there is an english dub but after recent event of certain game with english dub..I'm looking at you The Last Remnant , I think listening to some japanese language would be better. The character creator is very minimal , you can't really create a unique character... you can pick a set amount of hairstyle and facestyle and that's it...oh yeah you can pick what kind of voice you have although your character don't say anything except with the usual HIYAA HUUAAHHGH AYEEEEEEEEEE you get the idea. There is a variety of weapon to choose from which is a very long sword , reminds me of sephiroth sword. A sickle and mace in one. A big club. Bow and arrow (Daikyu kind of bow). Rifle yes.. a rifle no..not an assault rifle , more like a musket but you don't have to reload every one shot because man that would be one hell of a story to tell... Spear , Naginata , Dual Daggers and Gauntlets. Each have their own unique moves and attack pattern suited for every playstyle. You can also put in mitama in them which enhances the weapon and give you unique skill. Mitama are... okay im not gonna explain them here google it pl0x<br><br>Now multiplayer , if you don't got friends to play with chances of you playing multiplayer is very close to zero.. why? Because there's no lobby and chat room and shindig. You have to go to this blue stone thing a majig and you will get two choices &quot;Create Lobby&quot; and &quot;Join Lobby&quot;. You create a lobby and then you have to write the name of the lobby you want say for example you write &quot;My room 101&quot; then for people to find your lobby they have to go to &quot;Join Lobby&quot; and then type in exactly like you did to find your game. This is in my opinion very revolutionary in our era :D *sarcasm*. Oh yes you can't type like you normally type in multiplayer game , because this is a port ... a bad one .. you can pick a set of sentences written for you like Let's get slaying out there! ..hah..haha...who says that...or You...You pervert! Err...yeah...<br>There is also emote so that's nice.<br><br>About the random crashes in multiplayer... its completely random but it seems to only happen during a mission with my friend. It was frustrating because that mission required us to look for a boss in a big area and after let's say...10 minutes of searching we found it and then I crashed , I was the host btw. My friend didnt crash.. It might be that the hoster is the only one that crashes during multiplayer but other than that I'm not sure. <br><br>Now you're probably wondering....how...how is it that I playing with keyboard in this game is a sane thing to do. The answer is it's not. It was a nightmare...Q E R and F for camera control!?!?! L AND P FOR LIGHT ATTACK AND HEAVY ATTACK???!!? WHAT IS THIS? DID WE TRAVEL BACK IN TIME?? AM I HACKERMAN? Ehem.. Well at first I was optimistic about it and was like Meh...I can do this .. shouldnt be too bad but then..I slowly descended into madness and thus asked my friend to emulate mouse control in this game and so began our journey of finding out how to emulate mouse control in this game. My friend made a guide on how to use mouse to control the camera in this game check it out! :D It also includes playing the game in borderless windowed so that mouse clicks no longer tabs you out of the game...yes the game don't like it when you click your mouse...it tabs you out ~~^_^~~ <br><br>I'd say this is a terrible pc port but it's actually a good game , it's just that the the issues listed above...why did they even bother not fixing this and then releasing it on PC. I said it once and I'll say it again , get it on sale. Just don't buy it full price....you might regret it ._. BUT hey its your money...I'm sorry I hope your not offended<br><br>PS. There's a place where you can take a bath and its &quot;public&quot; to get bonuses but I know your not after that also don't go during woman's only time if your playing a male character or vice versa ( I know you will ;))<br><br>*insert didntread.gif here*<br><br>In summary ears ringing jaw fractured three ribs cracked four broken diaphragm hemorrhaging , physical recovery 6 weeks full psychological recovery 6 months...oh wait..<br>Terrible port but good game. Shouldn't be much of a problem if you have an xbox controller.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29142121', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29142121' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29142121\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29142121' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29142121\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29142121', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29142121_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29142121_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29007259\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OzziOse\/recommended\/363130\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"8207947\">Ozzi<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 34.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat story combat feels clunky at times even with a controller. It was poorly ported to the PC as the options menu are limited  then the only way to exit the game is by manually saving at your house then it asks if you want to go back to the title screen which lets you quit the game or you can Alt F4 and then when you pause the game it unpauses if you try to use the overlay or any key is tapped on the keyboard oh it's also not Steam Link friendly. <br><br>I would give this game a rating of 3\/5 recommend getting it on sale for 50% off and not it's full price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29007259', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29007259' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29007259\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29007259' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29007259\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29007259', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29007259_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29007259_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/363130\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 971 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30825590","30346142","20344215","29933174","18444215","24154530","16949465","22886993","18524247","22855260"]}
