I've been following the game for a long time, I've played its demos and I'm extremely happy to finally see it on Steam. However, my review will not be biased ; the game isn't perfect and potential buyers need to know the good sides, but also the bad sides of the game.<\/i><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">What is it ?<\/div>Lamm is a puzzle-platformer, or to be more accurate, a platformer with a cool and unique twist that I will explain later. It's divided in several worlds, themselves composed of six to eight levels each. You access them via a nice looking hub, but progress is linear and you can't go to another world if you feel stuck. Each and every world brings something new to the table, whether it be saws, water or the simple concept of darkness.<br><br>Despite its looks, Lamm is far from a Super Meat Boy x Limbo crossover. B&amp;W has been used in games for a very long time and its choice here is pretty relevant, accentuating the importance of the colored orbs. These are, by the way, the coolest aspect of the game ; by default, your character cannot jump. He has to pick up a colored orb to gain the ability to make a certain number of jumps (Black = 0, White = 1, Yellow = 2...). This idea is used through the whole game in different and unique ways, which I quite frankly haven't seen in another game to this date.<br><br>Everything isn't perfect, obviously. The difficulty ramps up very nicely but might be a bit too much for some, especially in later levels. The hidden fireflies in each level are sometimes tough to find, let alone get since you also have to end the level to truly &quot;keep&quot; them. But they unlock the best levels in the game, ranging from &quot;easy with a twist&quot; to &quot;mind-twisting hard&quot; !<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">My opinion<\/div>I'm an experienced platformer player and I had a lot of fun with Lamm. The first levels are quite easy, but things quickly get a bit tougher and you have to think to get through levels without dying. It's never impossibly hard either, which I liked, but the last levels are a real challenge. <br>Even though I've read some negative feedback about the game's looks on Greenlight, it's something that doesn't really bother me. The game looks nice, every world felt fresh and I can't really ask for more. Considering its relatively cheap price, this was good. If I had to mark Lamm, it would be a solid <b>7.5\/10<\/b> : Good, does its job well and doesn't overstay its welcome. <br><br><b>TL;DR<\/b><br>Pros :<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique gameplay that feels fresh and familiar at the same time.<br><\/li><li>Replay value : collectables in every level, speedrun-friendly timer.<br><\/li><li>The difficulty curve is as steep as it is rewarding.<br><\/li><li>Acceptably long - around two to four hours, depending on your skills and motivation to 100%. Might be even longer if you want good times !<br><\/li><li>Very low price.<\/li><\/ul><br>Cons :<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The difficulty curve is as steep as it is rewarding.<br><\/li><li>Could do with less linearity to help players keep playing even if they get stuck.<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29806745', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29806745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29806745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29806745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29806745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29806745', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29806745_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29806745_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29831008\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021334209\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"61068481\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/37f281187b7cf6499fff400a3436d62a8cf87b71.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/37f281187b7cf6499fff400a3436d62a8cf87b71.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/37f281187b7cf6499fff400a3436d62a8cf87b71_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021334209\/\" data-miniprofile=\"61068481\">Lassie<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021334209\/games\/?tab=all\">102 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021334209\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021334209\/recommended\/586340\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is what the games looks like:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nQzZ9CuZZ8U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/nQzZ9CuZZ8U<\/a><br><br>Lamm is frustratingly difficult and at the same time deeply satisfying.

For example white orbs give 1 jump,yellow 2 and so on with a maximum of 5. The black orbs reset you to no jumps and if you have the yellow orb and then collect the white orb you will be resetted to one jump. The game is more of a puzzle game where you have to figure out which orbs to collect in what order to beat the level. The game has 6 worlds each having 6 levels and a 7th level is unlocked if you collect something called fireflies which are 1 each in the level which are placed in difficult to reach places and require backtracking to collect the same. The levels are very short about a minute each and basically the game is also built for speedrunning. The first 5 worlds are unique with new mechanics introduced which are elements in the world like  water,platforms that disappear,switches and so on. The platforming is difficult and is made a bit frustrating by the controls not being that accurate but only very few levels require atmost precision platforming.<br><br>I enjoyed the game till world 5. world 6 requires you to collect 30 of the 35 fireflies spread across the prior levels and this world is very poorly designed with most of the level in darkness or with flickering lights. I hated this world as it was very difficult to figure out where to go. Also the fireflies located in these levels I could not locate one among the 6 levels. I could not get to the unlocked world 6 stage and a secret stage at the end.<br><br>Overall an enjoyable game until world 5 but the last world is very frustrating due to poor level design. Would still recommend for the remaining levels to all gamers who enhoy puzzle platformers. The puzzles here might not seem obvious initially but worlds 2,3 and 5 are slow paced and involve collecting orbs in a particular sequence(there is no wall of death following you) and world 4 is pure fast paced platforming with a giant approaching wall of the death from the left or above.<br>The music nicely blends in and does not get frustrating in world 4 where you are surely to die a lot.<br><br>Overall recommend this game for the asking price.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30042757', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30042757' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30042757\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30042757' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30042757\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30042757', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30042757_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30042757_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/586340\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 9 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29806745","29831008","30042757"]}
