Ill go into detail here what you can expect from this DLC.<br><br><br>This DLC adds three new Operations two of them being from the perpective of the Chinese border guards. The third being of the Russian border guards. Each of these operations affers a wide area without many LOS blockage to contend with and many hills that the player can take advantage of. The PLA throught the entirety of all three opertions recieve very little support and no armored\/air assests. This makes the player make the most of the assest they have and it makes it extremely important to utilize ambushes as well as supperior manouvering in order to pre-vail. The chinese missions are by far the hardest in the entire game. It can be done however.<br><br>Operation 1: This operation puts you in charge of roughly 80 chinese boder guard units, and tasks you with stopping a Soviet tanks assault. Throughout this Operation you will enjoy superior starting positions, as well \u2665\u2665\u2665 the use of trenches for concealment and so forth. This Operation is pretty much impossible to win as the PLA.<br><br>Operation 2: Another PLA OP, this time you are tasked with assaulting the Soviet BOP's and gaining a foothold in the Zhalanashkol lake region. In this OP the russians recieve some late game support in the form of some Mechanized infantry in BDRMS. For the majority of the Operation however it is quite possible to inflict heavy casualties utilizing just your men. Again just about 80 or so men with 30-40 more arriving early in the OP as support. Again very hard to win.<br><br>Operation 3: You get to play as the russians this time and get to enjoy their very sexy new uniforms and textures. In this Operation you will enjoy more firepower, better trained and equiped troops, and <b>Air support<\/b>. Pretty much the perfect scenario for new players to cut their teath on. It offers both vehicles and air support as well as a decent ammout of troops to control and learn the best ways to win in different scenarios. For more expierenced players I suggest turning all the diffuculy setting up as high as possible to get the best out of this one. Its essentially one of the easiest campaings so long as you dont let the chinese dig trenches or ambush you.<br><br>All of these campaings are 6 turns so short and sweet. Each engagment is still quite brutal however. I recommend this DLC to both new players as well as older players just looking for a change of pace.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24611045', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24611045' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24611045\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24611045' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24611045\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24611045', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24611045_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24611045_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24611045"]}
