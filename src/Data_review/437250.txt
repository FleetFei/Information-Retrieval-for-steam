It will make you feel like a Victorian Marco Polo skittering through Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities on a giant bugtrain, while sipping on some of that cosmic horror and understated dark humor blend perfected by the Fallen London gents (is it possible to talk bout this game without mentioning them? probably not). <br><br>In my opinion, despite being less polished, this is the superior game - more enjoyable to play (and forgiving) than its siblings Sunless Sea and FTL, more densely packed with ideas and atmosphere than anything I have played in a long while, putting to shame many projects with much larger writing teams (Torment, looking at you).<br><br>With so much sterling prose to read (a mind-boggling amount from a lone author), it really does not feel like the House had to be padded with so much empty space. I understand that the vast spaces are meant to create a pacing, and a sense of danger as you pick a random direction and venture as far as you can, hoping your fuel, hull and sanity will endure until you reach some harbor.<br>Unfortunately, there really is a little too much of that, and I feel like all I will ever experience from this game is a tiny fraction of what it has to offer, as the perspective of 10 more minutes of backtracking through mostly empty rooms for the next two bits of dialogue in some questline has become more grating than the reward. But perhaps it is fine - the House is too big for one person, and I have seen more than enough to be content.<br><br>Another issue is being asked in various quests to find random assortments of items, and not being given the slightest idea of where they might be found - I spend a couple of hours in vain looking for an oscillating prism to help the rebellious Heart of a Prince, and had to fail this intriguing questline, only to find such a prism by chance an hour later. Some sort of oracle to help with finding things would have been hugely appreciated.<br><br>Still, this game deserves all the praise I have to give. I was sold when I learned you play as a poet, journalist and museum curator. But the real heroes here are the cities, the locales, the diseases and the gods. (oh boy are there gods aplenty in that House). I dearly envy a mind capable of birthing that level of brilliance by the metric ton.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30501019', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30501019' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30501019\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30501019' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30501019\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30501019', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30501019_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30501019_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30380429\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166548664\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"206282936\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df9131a35786a39f05f1f529549e25a06238d798.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df9131a35786a39f05f1f529549e25a06238d798.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/df\/df9131a35786a39f05f1f529549e25a06238d798_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166548664\/\" data-miniprofile=\"206282936\">Curry in a Hurry<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166548664\/games\/?tab=all\">62 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166548664\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166548664\/recommended\/437250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">39.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo this is a quality exploration game. The writing is good, and the atmosphere is spot on. I honestly love it. However, that isn't to say it's not without its flaws. The game is buggy as all hell, some storylines having progression stopping bugs, like crashing no matter what you choose at that point. I'll go through some pros and cons.<br><br>pros:<br>-Fantastic writing<br>-unique premise<br>-nice turn based FTL inspired combat system<br>-very similar to sunless sea (which I loved) but with better pacing at not nearly as unforgiving<br><br>cons:<br>-bugs. Jesus christ the bugs.<br>Yeah that's pretty much it. I would have no complaints if it were not for the bugs.<br><br>While the game may be buggy, you should take into consideration the facat that the studio is only one guy. He can't find every single bug himself, and that's where the players have come in. He's been remarkably communicative with the players and has even followed up with specific bug reports after patching it. I have to applaud him for his proactive approach to communicating with the community, and lots of large studios could really learn a thing or two from him.<br><br>All in all, and for all its bugs, I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing love this game. It's clever, its interesting, and you can seduce a 10 mile high tower of conjoined crows.

A cosmic horror fan should especially buy this game.<br><br>I am going to actively avoid mentioning certain other games, because I think that this game deserves at least a few reviews that take it on its own merits and not in comparison to others. <br><br>Though the launch was a bit rough, with a lot of bugs rearing their heads, the dev put out 18 patches in a short time to clean up almost every bug and detail. Now this game plays pretty smoothly and it really is a fun time. I always find myself thinking &quot;Oh, I have things to do, I'll get to the next location and save and quit.&quot; And then that repeats as at each location I uncover new steps and new things to do, new trails to follow. It is very easy to lose track of time by just following the many stories that come up so naturally through gameplay.<br><br>Pros:<br>Excellent writing<br>Lots of moral choice and ambiguity, even surrounding what seem like horribly callous or malicious acts. I stole a mother's memories of her children and it didn't even seem like the worst idea.<br>Not terribly grindy. Access to a few resources might be rather specific, but the basic things you need are relatively easily obtained, so progress occurs at your pace.<br>Unique world with a variety of interesting interpretations of various ideas and themes.<br><br>Cons:<br>There are still a few bugs, especially surrounding dialogue in certain dreams.<br>Controls and scenery during travel are a bit rough. Turning can be weird if you have a lot of carts.<br>In-game documentation is a bit sparse. You only get to see what your stats do one time, to the best of my knowledge. Make sure you remember it.<br><br><br>Pro\/Con: Depending on how much directness you like in your cosmic horror. This game does not shy away from brutal and awful events being described quite plainly. Much cosmic horror takes an 'averted eyes' and euphemistic stance on dark events; this game definitely does not. While I find that a refreshing approach, some of the events have surprisingly made me feel upset. I rarely feel so attached to a game or character that I get emotionally involved in events to that degree, so I am overall pleased with that sort of connection.

Long gone are the days of playing an RPG for 36 hours straight while home &quot;sick&quot; from school. Instead I often find myselff playing an hour of a cheap Steam game, then moving on and never looking back. So to find this gem of a game on it's release day has been a breath of fresh air.<br><br>As you will see from other reviews, dev blogs, forums, etc... the game in its current state is still fairly buggy. I made it about 12 hours before I had any crashing, whereas others had it fairly early on. <b>HOWEVER,<\/b> the one-man dev team <b>(yes it's all the brainchild of one man)<\/b> has already addressed these issues and has been working around the clock to fix them. Mr. Tuffs has been all over social media and the discussion forums taking note of any and all issues, fixing them, AND answering all the questions players have had. So hats off to him!<br><br>With that being said, this game is an absolute delight. I have been able to easily look past any minor technical glitches. Hell, I haven't really minded the crashes either. The story-telling in so in depth that it completely enraptures your senses. Almost every conversation you have gives you a multitude of choices that can lead to nearly infinite possibilities. Some moments are blood-curdling terrifying <b>(don't ever let your sanity go to 0, just saying)<\/b>, some are sombre and filled with melancholy, and some are so bizarre and outlandish that they are down right hilarious (looking at you Tybalt). This game is very text heavy, which makes me feel better about already spending 15 hours on it. It's no different from reading a book, right? And that's just it. This game feels like I am delving into an interactive book series filled to the brim with adventure, heartache, war, and glory.<br><br>The artwork is absolutely moody and gorgeous. At first I was unsure how I felt about a lack of imagery (example, you won't see a character portrait for each and every new face you meet), but the writing is done so well that it is easy to conjure up your own visualizations. Combined with an impressive, atmospheric score that is reminiscent of what Ramin Djawadi did for 'Westworld', each new location you visit immediately gives a sense of what it's all about. Maybe it's a nice safe haven or a seedy stopover for romantic pirates, or maybe you shouldn't stop in this room at all. <br><br>The characters themselves feel completely fleshed out, even those who technically don't have flesh. With character driven plot-points and missions, I quickly felt deeply connected with all members of my crew. While the lower deck crew just seems like a revolving door of bodies (seriously can they just for once not fall prey to the darkness?), the upper deck crew feels like that lovable rag-tag bunch of miscreants from all your favourite stories and shows. <br><br>Admittedly, I had difficulty getting a grasp on battles at first. Although there is a bit of a tutorial, I still had no idea what I was doing. I hope in the near future a full tutorial can be constructed, as I feel this will aid the gameplay tremendously. However, once you figure it out, battles are quite fun and IMO have the best music in the whole game (think 1920s carnival). Because battles are not random encounters, you can easily avoid them if you'd like. However, not every ship\/creature\/dirigible\/kinetopede is an enemy, so why not try saying hello to all of them.<br><br>Overall, I am completely enamoured with this beautifully creepy, gothic, witty, and inventive game. It needs some polishing here and there, and could have benefitted from some early access time, but things happen and that's life. I have the utmost faith in the developer that all issues will be handled, so I encourage everyone to give it a shot. With the right support and backing I can see this game reaching cult status, especially due to it's replayability. <br><br>Ciao for now! I have to get back to fixing a ghoul election, seducing an oil rig, and aiding a mad underwater scientist destroy the House.

They weigh heavily on our conscious and given enough time alter your personality, and your memories. In the dark underworld of A House of Many Doors, these negative thoughts come in the form of a physical disturbance. In the form of  a frightening parasitic world where your very memories can be stolen, destroying what makes you, you.<br><br>Your journey starts as one of these unfortunate plundered minds. A leader to a group of scavengers and keeper of one of the many Keys to the doors of The House, you learn your memory has been stolen by one of the many groups of mind thieves who scour the wastelands. In order to act as an effective leader, you'll need your memories back and so you take off in search of the bandits. Finding this box of memories and reclaiming it is just the beginning, however, as it turns out to be only a small part of a much larger and ominous plot that sends you off into the world in search of answers.<br><br>The world is constantly living and moving around you through the tales told in every interaction. Talking to crew members while on the map opens many personal quests and stories for your crew members from cynical skeptics who think they've seen everything of worth to booze-hound surgeons with rumors of occultist organ harvesting. Each member has their own set of dialogue trees, their own varied personalities, and own ways of effecting the story based on the answers and reactions you give them. The inhabitants of the towns you visit also carry unique stories to either ignore or become a part of, and for the more dastardly of wanderers can even be taken prisoner for your future endeavors and profits.<br><br>As you whisk yourself from each sprawling and crumbling monument or town, you and your crew navigate the darkness of the overworld in your mechanical centipede-like locomotive. Your creaking mass of Steampunk looking steel crawls between each section of the map as various debris and relics litter each field, and sometimes memory-hunters or grotesque creatures appear to search you out. And in some cases depending on the quests you are given, you will search these foes out for answers or rewards. Coming into contact with one of these aggressive elements on the map sends you into a tactical battle, not unlike FTL. You'll go head-to-head with other kinetopedes utilizing the skills of your crew members, protecting vulnerable and important sections, and facing off with your accumulated and equipped arsenal.<br><br>The stories are decided through Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style branching choices in dialogue and events. Each choice provides your adventure with specific outcomes tailored to the personality and decisions you've given and made for yourself. Every outcome has its own consequences, or sometimes if you're lucky or witty enough, rewards. Within a single sitting I had lost crew members to dark possessions that drove them to their suicides, taken human passengers as captives for profits from slave traders, and had romantic relations with questionable entities such as a shark dude and an oil-rig. I could go on and on about the many strange and creative adventures I had been a part of, but it would only spoil the beautiful tale-crafting that makes up the core of House of Many Doors.<br><br>I was up all night, sleeplessly weaving and being a part of extraordinary tales. By the end of my trek, which is still churning on somewhere in the game's world for when I return, I had ferried so many strange and colorful passengers with such odd and extraordinary pasts and personalities. I had accumulated a mass of the oddest items from occultist tools to otherworldly relics. Even better, I had a museum built in my name to keep all of my obscure and otherworldly findings in, encouraging me to search the most mysterious places possible. I had seen and learned so much, yet the inner-working of this dark underworld where parasites feed from the energy of other dimensions mostly remained a mystery still to someday be discovered.<br><br>Such limitless imagination, and from the mind of one sole developer. The world has its own dreamed up calendar system, its own social hierarchies, and a world map filled with incredibly diverse and awe-inspiring regions that change location with any playthrough. The art is outstanding, music is melodic and memorable, the tactical combat is addictive, and most of all the stories crafted by your adventure will worm their way through your mind when not even playing as infectiously as the parasites within. It's a game every lover of tales will remember and think about for a long time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29757580', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29757580' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29757580\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29757580' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29757580\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29757580', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29757580_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29757580_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29682874\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/waftwaffle\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93076053\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e24386871a23553cc0b2fd4ee8d47a8a682b06cb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e24386871a23553cc0b2fd4ee8d47a8a682b06cb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e2\/e24386871a23553cc0b2fd4ee8d47a8a682b06cb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/waftwaffle\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93076053\">waftwaffle<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/waftwaffle\/games\/?tab=all\">144 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/waftwaffle\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/waftwaffle\/recommended\/437250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t+ If you enojoy Sunless Sea, give this a try.

set in a bizarre patchwork dimenions.  Though a bit unpolished, it's compelling and extremely well-written, with plenty of twists and turns, a lot to do, and multiple ending.<br><br>You may have heard some concerns about the game's polish.  There are some. However, this is also a game where I was able to seduce a one-eyed undead woman at a bar inside a hollow tree before dropping off a passenger at a city of slavers where I was looking to forment a rebellion.  I also found a dog from another world, fixed an election, and now a guy who exists in two tmelines at once wants to sleep with me.  So I'm forgiving some polish issues.<br><br>So let's get the questions out of the way:<br>1) The launch was buggy and there were some polish issues.  The author worked his backside off on those to fix them in the first few days.  As of this writing there's still some bugs being quashed and new features being added - it's actively supported.<br>2) It's inspired by Sunless Sea and Fallen London but is very much its own world and own thing, with it's own feel and sensibilities.  In fact, some of its other influences will surprise you when  you find them . . .<br>3) It's probably one of the best-written and most imaginative games you'll play, period. For sheer gut-punch emotional impact I'm going to put it up there with Personal 4, Fallen London, and a few other games.<br><br>OK, done there, good.  On with the review.<br><br>House Of Many Doors is a sandbox &quot;explore-trade-interact&quot; RPG in the vein of &quot;Pirates,&quot; its inspiration &quot;Sunless Sea,&quot; and more.  Highly literate, atmospheric, and story-driven it's probably a game that means &quot;Sunless Sea&quot; is a genre now, kind of like GTA became.  Sunless Sandbox?<br><br>You play an adventurer and writer who was born in the House, a dimension that steals from other dimensions and stashes parts of them inside itself, a giant structure of connected rooms.  In this dark, mysterious place are cities, places, people, and even gods and natural laws pilfered from elsewhere.  Despite the chaos, civilizations have managed to arise in this place over the centuries and do what civilizations do - write, fight, expand, study, and die.<br><br>You decided to explore it, though as you come to after a pirate attack it's not going quite as planned.  Soon, depending on what you want to do you might search for missing memories, follow a god, battle pirates, or become a news reporter.  Or just get to know all your crew and seduce them as you travel around in your Sex Train.<br><br>There's a LOT to do in House of Many Doors.<br><br>Gameplay consists of:<br>1) Wandering through the &quot;cells&quot; of the house in your &quot;Kinetopede.&quot;  This is pretty simple if fast-playing.  Most of it involves looking for glowing signs of interesting stuff or dodging enemies.<br>2) When you can't or don't outrun enemies (which isn't too hard especially if you build a high-speed Kinetopede) you fight them in a kind of turn-based FTL-style combat.  Combat is interesting, though not as well explained as it could be.<br>3) In cities and major locations you can trade, interact, upgrade your kinetopede, sell, buy, and indulge in all sorts of adventures and stories.<br>4) You interact with your crew to improve abilites and follow their stories, and if you want, get romantic with them.  Not all of them are romance options, many have complex and interesting stories with multiple endings - not all of them good or happy.<br>5) Actions unlock all sorts of other actions, stories, challenges, and more.  One posession, one choice, one test might send you down a whole other story. Part of the game is figuring out what unlocks other parts.<br>6) You can take on a variety of jobs and tasks; preach about a god, write for the news, smuggle information, start a civil war.  Played right almost any path is rewarding.<br>7) You can write in the game.  Get experience for writing poetry, compose a mangum opus, be a news reporter. and more.  Experiences and news are like items - you can acquire them, combine them, and use them to achieve various goals.<br><br>So when it comes down to it, yes the game is good, in some cases exceptional, and in a few groundbreaking.).  There's a lot to do, a lot to explore, many options.  It's brilliantly written and incredibly evocative.<br><br>There are flaws as mentioned.  The launch was buggy.  The game has a lot of polish issues, little things that could have made it easier, or irritating design choices.  It has, pretty much, the very issues you'd expect to find in an indie game.<br><br>However, it's a very impressive game.  So the question is, who is this for?<br><br>* If you like indie games and games that get truly imaginative and outrageous, it's hard not to reccomend it.  This is everything we expect from a good indie title, something that doesn't just push the boundaries, it pushes them off a cliff - especially in the area of writing and worldbuilding.  It's existence is a reminder of how good game writing can be and how a world can come to life.<br>* If you want a change from the same-old-same-old  sandbox-explorer type games.  This is a change, especially with the plot and the unusual choices.<br>* If you're looking for AAA type polish, no you won't have it.  This is an indie game, with it's limits.  It's also an indie game so it gets over many OTHER limits, but it has its flaws.<br>* If you're not sure of the whole sandbox-literary-rpg mix it's not a good starting point.<br>* It'd probably make a good gift for an indie-loving friend.<br><br>House of Many Doors isn't for everyone.  But the fact it exists makes the gaming world a little more interesting for all of us.  If you think it might be for you and are willing to invest some time getting to know it, it'll probably be worth it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29733794', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29733794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29733794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29733794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29733794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29733794', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29733794_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29733794_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30008736\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197968907104\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"8641376\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94306d1086e36b3751a3acda0484afd47772fa08.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94306d1086e36b3751a3acda0484afd47772fa08.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94306d1086e36b3751a3acda0484afd47772fa08_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197968907104\/\" data-miniprofile=\"8641376\">TheSHEEEP<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197968907104\/games\/?tab=all\">465 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197968907104\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197968907104\/recommended\/437250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttl;dr version: You like games with excellent writing and\/or Sunless sea? BUY THIS!<br><br>I would say Sunless Sea and A House Of Many Doors are like siblings.<br>Clearly the same family, but really quite different characters.<br><br>A House of Many Doors is the bigger one - the map really comes off as bigger, though divded into sections, a bit similar to Binding Of Isaac.<br><br>It is also the more talkative sibling - there is simply more writing (but excellent writing, no less).<br><br>It has a worse taste in fashion - the UI has many smaller quirks and issues and is rather inefficient at times, which can be a bit annoying.<br><br>It is a bit more clever than it's brother - instead of action combat, combat in this game is turn based and allows you to apply some actual tactics and send people around. Nice!<br><br>It is more merciful - you can save at (almost?) any time and have different save slots.<br><br>It is a worse dancer - The controls range between working fine and &quot;why does this feel so weird to control&quot;, some of this is related to the UI issues.<br><br>It is insane - I mean, even more so than Sunless Sea. Wonderful.<br><br><br>If asked which one I would recommend more, I'd have kind of a hard time. Sunless Sea is more polished, no doubt. But give this one some more time &amp; publicity and I am sure the developer can iron out many of the remaining issues.<br>But either way, you can't go wrong with buying A House of Many Doors.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30008736', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30008736' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30008736\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30008736' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30008736\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30008736', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30008736_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30008736_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30863967\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/KevTM\/recommended\/437250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"68877767\">kevthemagnificent<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 98.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like it.

The basic premise-- that you are an explorer piloting a vessel through dangerous, otherworldly darkness-- is exactly the same. You move through text-based storylines that lead you from one port to another, and often require you to collect items from unknown ports in other parts of the world. That being said, this game has its own benefits and shortfalls as compared to Sunless Sea. <br><br>Pros: Progression through the game feels much faster. Your craft travels fairly quickly, and through fairly easily obtained upgrades you can make it move quite fast. On multiple replays, the beginning isn't quite so repetitive, because you aren't channeled to one or two main quests. There are more options. The world feels much vaster. I haven't completed the map, but as compared to Sunless Sea, it seems as though there are far more cities to visit. Money is also much easier to accumulate, so you don't feel as though you are just scraping by for too long. Also, using the weight-based (rather than item number based) cargo system, it's much easier to carry around a lot of light, useful items, and you can increase your hold size without affecting travel too much.<br><br>Cons: The art style is a bit lacking. I get sick of seeing the same rocks, the same trees with the same interaction text, the same ruined buildings with the same events over and over again. I also don't like the way travel feels choppy (though it is justified in the context of the game). I would like running seamlessly through the world far more than I would popping from room to room. The music, while I generally don't have a problem with it, is grating in some regions of the map-- too loud and intrusive (up by Chimer, for instance). The combat system is only so-so. I don't like how I get whisked away to a sort of mini-game to fight. I would prefer combat be incorperated in the terrain that was provided by the room. Also, because the terrain of the rooms is randomly generated, sometimes I appear in a room and immediatly smash into an archway or something, which is annoying. There are also some movement glitches or something where, though it appears there's nothing in the way of my centipede, I can't move forward or turn. The game is also a bit buggy in general, though I do think that it's being actively worked on. <br><br>It's a fun game, albeit less polished than I would like, with good writing, good pacing, original locations, and reasonably quick progression.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30172915', 'recent_short' );
