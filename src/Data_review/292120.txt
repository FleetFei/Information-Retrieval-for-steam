Yes, it is a linear RPG that made the unfortunate choice of putting the first section of the game literally &quot;on rails&quot; (a railroad), and it is absolutely true that it takes upwards of 20-30 hours before you get to the open world sections. <br><br>People tend to forget that the most beloved &quot;open world&quot; final fantasies only felt open world: you could go to your choice of 2 or 3 new areas or backtrack, not travel wherever you wanted. This mis-remembrance is really the source of most of the game's hate, in several areas.<br><br>First, the aforementioned linearity. <br>Second, unlikable characters (apart from 9, and now 15, I believe this is true of ALL final fantasy titles).<br>Third, &quot;oversimplified combat.&quot; This is the one that irks me the most. People complain that the paradigm system encourages you to &quot;just mash x&quot; with no strategy. These people must have not progressed very far in the game, because managing sentinel and healer roles while preventing your stagger bar from depleting with damage classes is a difficult balance to strike. As for &quot;mashing x,&quot; this is what you do in every. turn. based. rpg. ever. You cycle up the attack command or whatever skill you're spamming, and mash x as fast as you can. the only difference here is that you can use libra or fight the same enemy type repeatedly to have your characters learn what spell is the best. How does this change the traditional RPG experience?<br><br>Instead of scrolling through lightning and blizzard to get to fire, the character learns that fire is most effective and auto ques it for you, which you push X to confirm.<br><br>Don't believe the hate. It's an engaging and beautiful (graphical fidelity still holds up today) game that gets you 50+ hours of gameplay for around 20 bucks.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30448075', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30448075' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30448075\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30448075' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30448075\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30448075', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30448075_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30448075_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30382905\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134172576\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"173906848\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134172576\/\" data-miniprofile=\"173906848\">liquidswordz89<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134172576\/games\/?tab=all\">3 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134172576\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134172576\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">60.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery good game, totally don't understand the extremely negative reviews.  Overall it was a really fun game that I definitely enjoyed, the battle system especially was fast and fun and provided a lot of strategy where you had to customize and switch up your style to defeat certain bosses.<br><br>This game definitely has problems however, mostly in terms of the story and the leveling up system.  I really enjoyed the leveling system towards the end of the game where it opened up and offered more customization, but the criticisms that it essentially was an automatic function that gave you a false sense of choices in the beginning half of the game are valid.  The weapon upgrading system also was not explained and presented well, but besides not exactly knowing what was going on you can do it and really have no problem, though later game weapons were made useless as it makes more sense to just continue to level whatever weapons you started to level in the beginning.<br><br>In terms of the story, this is where the game really falls short, but the linearity was NOT the problem IMO.  I don't mind linearity because it allows a compelling story to be told, though this game could have done a better job disguising it (kindof like how FFX did).  The main problem with the story was the way it was told.  Upon researching further into the story I found that really crucial and important backstory wasn't explained or addressed in the game, not in the cinematics or the datalogs (I read every single datalog), and therefore motivations and plot points weren't understood, and you had to essentially say &quot;oh well I guess this is what is happening, just because&quot; and accept the premise the game was giving you if you were going to continue to enjoy the story (which I did and therefore was able to continue to enjoy it).  It also falls into the trap I've been noticing in FF recently where the rules of the universe aren't clearly defined, and then the story breaks those rules without offering any explanation.  What happens then is that main points of the story don't really make sense, and since they lead to other threads and main points further in the story, it makes it really hard to follow as the foundation the story rests on isn't stable.  Contrary to what a lot of reviewers say the story isn't convoluted at all, it really isn't even all that complex.  If that were the case I would have enjoyed it, what it really was was just told in a convoluted manner (the 13 days of flashbacks that are broken up into about 20 different segments that are revealed out of order at different times throughout the game) and main aspects of the story don't make sense, you essentially just have to accept them as such and not think about it too much.<br><br>When researching into the story and its further backstory what is being told here is actually quite compelling, I just wish the game did a better job of explaining all of this in-game, datalogs included (most of this stuff wasn't explained in them either).  Also the ending pretty much uses a deus ex machina that doesn't really make sense, and it was one of the only FF endings that didn't have me tearing up or really eliciting strong emotions and feels, which is a real downside.  The other extreme negative was that there were quite a few sections that were essentially just padding, filler to grind out levels or so the game could reach its 40-45 hour playtime length, that really added nothing to the story and that I just wanted to get through.<br><br>Overall however this was a really fun game that I really very much enjoyed, besides the filler levels, the poor execution of the story and the sub-par ending, I genuinely thought multiple times throughout my play time &quot;Man, I don't get why everyone hates on this game it is actually really good!&quot;<br><br>There is a lot to enjoy here, the battle system is great and strategic, towards the second half the leveling up system worked really well and you really felt like you were becoming strong as hell when you make it through the final stages and onto the final boss, and there were genuinely great moments in the story that really captivated me.

You will see.<br>Personally i really enjoyed this game i have played other ff games (X, VIII, XII).<br>Like in any other FF game, it's open world expect for this one. At chapter 11 you finally have an open world which i was waiting for. I't really didn't matter to me that it was linear and straight forward.<br>The combat in the beginning is a bit too easy expect some eidolons.  I had some problems with Shiva, Odin.<br>The story was a bit lackluster but they did explained it later on. Alot of people seem to have some fps drops, I had no fps drops whatsoever<br>So i really like the game i am not done with it but i almost finished the game itself.<br>I can understand why people don't like this game, it's something you haven't seen in a while different combat,....<br>Apparently this game has 2 sequels, I haven't played them yet i probably won't ever cause it seems not very interesting for me <br>That's it, if you stick along this far you probably are bored and have to do something with your life. You should have already left this cause there are better reviews about this game.<br>If you are a FF Fan just buy it it's really not that bad\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30943914', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30943914' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30943914\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30943914' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30943914\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30943914', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30943914_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30943914_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30363926\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashirolikesbaumkuchen\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"92286422\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/277fad8dc0c2dd3bd03b1eb502ef2beefa973b16.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/277fad8dc0c2dd3bd03b1eb502ef2beefa973b16.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/277fad8dc0c2dd3bd03b1eb502ef2beefa973b16_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashirolikesbaumkuchen\/\" data-miniprofile=\"92286422\">Mashiro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashirolikesbaumkuchen\/games\/?tab=all\">307 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashirolikesbaumkuchen\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashirolikesbaumkuchen\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou basically want this game not because it has awesome gameplay (which it doesn\u00b4t)<br>You basically want this game because it has awesome cinematics, and a pretty good story with nice kawaii chars in it.<br><br>or something..<br><br><br><br><br>DID YOU SEE LIGHTNING?

Either you love it, or you hate it. Hence I'm not surprised to see such mixed reviews. (Of course, the poor port is adding fuel to the negative flames, but I'll address my views on that later on).<br><br>So here is where I am coming from; I have NEVER played a Final Fantasy game. This is my entry point into the franchise. I have played JRPGs but not on the PC, PS3 or Xbox; only old-school stuff like Sword of Mana on the Gameboy.<br><br>I did not expect much from the game, as whilst I patiently waited for it to download, I read almost exclusively negative feedback on steam and on the internet. I tried to ignore it, yet it did leave a sour taste. I launched the game expecting the PC to practically burst into flames. Hence my extreme surprise at how much I am genuinely enjoying myself.<br><br>I expected the game to be &quot;unplayable&quot;. Touch wood, but the game has not yet crashed\/stuttered\/glitched whilst I have been playing it. I have not needed to tweak Nvidia settings besides fiddling with V-sync; I did this after I had some lag in one battle with 6 or so enemies. After switching it off, the lag didn't happen again (I don't know if that was conicidence or not). My computer is not state of the art. I could list the specs but, really, it's not the newest nor the best. However, it does exceed the minimum and recommended specs listed below. I think that perhaps one should bear that in mind when buying this game; I don't know how well it will run on either listed specs. Perhaps ensure that you either hit recommended or exceed it.<br><br>Now, about the port. Yes, I wish the resolution wasn't fixed\/I could adjust graphics or sound in game\/the file size wasn't so damn large. But honestly? I am really captivated by this game. Perhaps this is due to me being fresh-faced. Perhaps I don't have preconceived standards for JRPGs and SE and FF. But, to me, the game looks magnificent and beautiful. I haven't even bothered to download the resolution fix because I'm enjoying the game as it is. Just as a side note, I am using a controller but I played for a bit with the keyboard and it was highly manageable. I prefer using the controller simply because I think the buttons have been mapped appropriately.<br><br>Now the actual game itself. The issues I saw on the internet about the game mainly revolved around A) a confusing story B) linearity C) rubbish characters. Here is what I think; The story really isn't that confusing. I have spent a bit of time reading the in-game datalog but I'm following it just fine. The game is linear at the beginning, but it hasn't exactly irked me up to this point like I expected it to. In fact, I needed the slow, linear, tutorialized start because I am completely new to the game style. In terms of characters, they all are fantastic. Yes, the infamous Vanille is poorly English voice acted and makes, um, extremely strange sighs and moans. At one point I turned to my sister and said, &quot;This sounds like a dodgy adult film.&quot; But she is overshadowed by the incredible Lightning Farron and Sazh. Lightning is a badass, yet her pain and inner conflict is so evident and tangible. Sazh is just great. Plus he has an afro with a chocobo chick just chilling inside it, try and not find that adorable.<br><br>The combat is REALLY great. I was worried it would bore me, but it has not as of yet. With the tougher enemies you need to micro-manage the fights intently; using Paradigm Shift has been a really interesting strategy and I'm starting to use it to my advantage. Combat is rewarding and I feel as though this game hits just the right difficulty; not too hard, not too easy. Just right for you to enjoy yourself yet still be challenged, without getting frustrated. This is so rare to find in a game.<br><br>I know my views conflict with others, yet I reiterate again; I come from a fresh-faced point of view. I had low expectations that were exceeded by this game.

I have 3 playthroughs now, looking forward to a 4th, and I would like to bring up a few points and offer my opinions, that potential players might have a better perspective on the game beforehand. This review will be quite lengthy, for there is a lot to cover, even scratching the surface as I am. I assure you there are no story spoilers.<br><br>Journey - The game is very linear. The first 80% of the story takes you on a singular path from one locale to the next, with little deviation, before it opens up into the main side-questing hub. (Firsttime players: at this point, I strongly advise following the map and pressing on with the main story for the best experience; there will be plenty of time later to complete this content, and you will be much better prepared.) Those of you looking for a cohesive, story-driven rpg that will keep you glued to your controller for 40 hours before you even get to the endgame, look no further.<br><br>Story - An intricate and well-developed plot replete with heroism, hope, despair, and intrigue. Consciously make sure you develop a firm understanding of the terms being used (l'Cie, fal'cie, etc.), or you will find yourself a bit confused often. The game introduces the story in a very logical way, and if you diligently read the journal entries, you may find yourself thoroughly immersed. The characters are very human (if sometimes melodramatic), and the overall experience was satisfying and complete.<br><br>Presentation - The polish in this game is quite astounding. The graphical style of the characters seems to deviate just enough from photorealism to avoid the uncanny valley, yet be very believeable; and I found myself often taking time away from the story to just stare at the environments for a bit. The soundtrack is phenomenal, sound design is very pleasing, and the voice acting is absurdly well done. If there was such a thing as a quadruple A title, this would be one.<br><br>Combat - Combat starts almost insultingly simple, but evolves into an extremely tactical and customizable aspect of the game. The systems used are quite novel, and somewhat difficult to describe. Your party maximum is 3 members, but you only control the party leader, and the commands you select are executed when your command queue (called ATB gauge, which charges within seconds at a set rate over time) finishes charging. This makes combat a much faster and action oriented experience than the customary Final Fantasy turn-based combat. Another aspect of combat is the paradigm system, wherein you save up to 6 builds (called paradigms in the game) for your party (out of combat) by specifying each member's role. These paradigms can then be cycled through (called paradigm shift) on-the-fly in combat to fit the given situation. There are 6 different role types. Put simply: tank, healing, damage, damage multiplier increasing, debuffing, and buffing. There is a ton of potential for diversity here. In order to survive many battles post-game, careful timing, thoughtful planning, and equipment tailored to the situation will all be required.<br><br>Progression - This is one of my favorite things about the game. While the system for leveling up is arguably as linear as the story to a certain degree, it simply cannot be denied that there is a vast and satisfying journey to be had in regards to increasing your party's strength. The game's EXP is used to purchase abilities and stat upgrades from giant role 'skill\/stat trees' (for lack of a better term). All 6 roles have their own trees, and eventually become accessible to everyone, but each character is 'native' to specific roles, meaning that progression with EXP through their native trees is much cheaper. This essentially means that your characters will be limited in their individual role capabilities until you are well past the end of the story. Maxing out each tree is possible, but it is an extremely daunting goal that will take many hours of post-game play to achieve, so there is a certain definite replayability in the way you level up your characters. At a certain point, you can also decide which 3 of 6 party members you utilize as your active party, and who you use as party leader (all of which can be changed at any time, once available). The role trees will be your primary source of progression, but upgrading weapons will increase their damage stat (there are 2 damage stats: strength and magic) boosts, and earlier in the game you will also find it useful to use accessories to boost your stats.<br><br>Endgame - As mentioned earlier, some of the endgame content is actually accessible before you finish the story. The trick here is that most of the encounters in this area will either leave you sweating by the end, or simply have you die within the first 10 seconds from a single blow. There are 64 side quests in the game, with some of them actually being woven into and required to complete for the main story. Each quest is essentially a boss enemy you are tasked with hunting down, and the 'quest givers' (term used to avoid plot details) are spread throughout a great portion of the game. To offset this, there is a fast travel network you unlock as you complete certain quests. Generally, the higher the quest number, the more difficult the boss and the better the item and EXP rewards. The fact that there are enemies that can simply wipe the floor with you by hardly trying is one of the things that makes this such a fun experience for me. Because eventually, if you do enough side quests, farm some of the more lucrative quests (quests are repeatable), and obtain the right equipment, you will eventually be more than a match for that enemy. And those groups you were sweating to beat when the quest hub unlocked will die in seconds. Other activities aside from questing include working at completing a robust set of achievements, upgrading your weapons to their ultimate forms (very expensive), upgrading your accessories, and maxing out role trees.<br><br>Replayability - As mentioned earlier, there is some replayability value in the design of the role tree system, and which 3 characters you choose to have your experience with when the feature is unlocked. There is also a choice to make for each character: that is if you are specializing them for strength or magic or both, in regards to weapon choice. Some characters may be more naturally inclined to one stat over the other, but it's still your choice. Personally, I think that perhaps the story itself is one of the greatest advocates for replayability. Despite its extreme linearity, it was an amazing and intense journey that I look back fondly on.<br><br>Beginner Tips - 1.Once you start gaining experience, don't rush the game and skip encounters. Doing so will leave you much weaker once you near the end of the story, and you will really just be making the game uncomfortably difficult for yourself. 2.Best defense is a good offense here most of the time. 3.Paradigm shift. A lot. 4.Grab ATB and accessory upgrades from the role trees asap.<br><br>Other opinions - As far as hearsay regarding this game in comparison to FFXIII-2 and FFXIII-3: The second and third games seemed little more than truly terrible fan fiction to me, and featured some awful game mechanic and interface changes\/additions. I simply can't understand why anyone would claim that they were an improvement over this game in any way whatsoever. Unfortunately, I found that the only way to preserve the memory of the wonderful characters I came to know and love in this game was to pretend that the second and third games do not even exist. Story and mechanics aside, they are absolutely abysmal ports, with the first game being BY FAR the best optimized port of the three. FFXIII is the masterpiece, people.<br><br>Closing - If you've taken the time to read this entire review, I hope you've gained a better understanding of what to expect from this game, and wish you a very enjoyable experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23286543', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23286543' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23286543\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23286543' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23286543\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23286543', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23286543_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23286543_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t251 of 307 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>31 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18794430\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"108939286\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d8c162bd0a7968376e9273b7a560b611743d672.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d8c162bd0a7968376e9273b7a560b611743d672.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d8c162bd0a7968376e9273b7a560b611743d672_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/\" data-miniprofile=\"108939286\">YoichiKuroma<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/games\/?tab=all\">1,540 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/YoichiKuroma\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">91.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 31, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">ok, now i finally beat this game, time for a review <br>\nenglish is not my main language, so bear with it.<\/div><br>FFXIII is different from other's FF i've played (VII, VIII, IX)<br>If you are looking for another [insert your favorite Final Fantasy here]. you wont get it here.<br><br><b>Story<\/b><br>When I started playing this game, I had no idea what's going on, too many terms i dont understand.

I don't want to spoil anything, but this kid has some serious issues, and the others let him get away with it bigtime. Really, his issues are solved for all the wrong reasons. Because of this, whenever I could, he wasn't selected for my battle party.. I am pointing out that Hope Estheim (among others) is a believable annoying character. One you would like to have a seat and talk to, and he starts screaming in your face and it's all your fault and you have to calm him but you can't and the only thing that calms him is to play along with the lie he's been telling himself (BAD MOVE SNOW! Now he thinks he's right, you a-hole). Phew. <br><br>As for the game(play), it's a Final Fantasy alright! I've played FF5 and up, and it belongs amongst the FF series. The game is for most of the story fixed on a path (as in, no free roam), which deviates from most previous FF's, although in all fairness you couldn't just go freeroaming in most other FF's. The gameplay unlocks very slow, I believe it was chapter 11 of 13 total, where you get to pick your own battle team and set up your preferences. It was chapter 11 that made me realize I actually was playing a Final Fantasy game, broad maps, lots and lots of side dishes, and monsters that snuff you out in seconds. Chocobo's finally make an entrance, and you get an introduction to one of the cooler features: Missions. To be able to wield the best equipment and beat the biggest monsters there is a lot (let me emphasize: A LOT) of grinding involved, which I like. This is on par with other FF's, the endboss of the game is laughable compared to some optional quests (missions) bosses. Next to powering yourself up (crystarium level up system, meh), you get an Eidolon per character. I barely used them at all, they change into vehicles once dismissed and that was something I found stupid (they have legs, some can fly for gods sake, no need for a vehicle). I really miss Ifrit too, although he probably is happy Square didn't turn him in a motorboat or bicycle or trike or whatever. <br><br>The meat of the game is the grinding part for all equipment (Treasure Hunter trophy isn't for the lazy to obtain, and this is how it should be, some easy trophies and some you have to work for) and the missions. The missions (64 in total) are ranged from easypeasy to how the hell am I going to beat this guy, and the difficulty exceeds the endboss' by far. Which is good, you only unlock the complete power up grid AFTER beating the game and you choose to 'git gud' and go for the mini-bosses and trophies, or choose to be satisfied and quit playing. If you choose to quit, you're missing out on some of the finer battles of the game, as well as the bigger hits and stronger teams (999.999 damage is fun to dish out). <br><br>So, it's slowwww going, annoying characters (yea every FF has those), weird plot, kind of a serious approach (I actually wouldn't let young kids near this game because of the heavy themes without lighter moments), for endgame there's a good deal of grinding and farming involved and reoccuring FF characters are missing (Wedge, Biggs, Ifrit, etc). Still, I like and I don't know why :).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30918735', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30918735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30918735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30918735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30918735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30918735', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30918735_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30918735_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30891814\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sandrohuang\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"193035735\">HappyGoLucky<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 47.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">INTRO<\/div>Final Fantasy 13 is the first season of Final Fantasy 13 Trilogy and it's how Final Faantasy have always been using ATB style, but FF13 could charge up to 6 ATB basic command use 1 while some use 2 or 3 or even 6. FF13 lvl up system is a bit different from the other FF games, i'll tell you later. <br>1st let's go to the story<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">STORY<\/div>Actually, i wouldn't bother buying 1st season of FF13 Trilogy if it's not for it's story, well the story is just that worth it for me. The story basically feels like so sad, so tragic, so touching. It's all about human who became a l'cie to fulfill a mission and they are going to sleep after doing the mission, so why is it interesting for me ? Let me tell you, i like how Square Enix style in writing the script for Final Fantasy 13 like there is this protagonist who is a soldier acting all tough all the time and so cold and there is this guy called Snow feels totally like an idiot but in the same time he is so cool. Well i won't spoil anymore than this just personally i think that this story is good if you like a story might as well try play FF13 Trilogy.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">BATTLE SYSTEM<\/div>As i mention before FF13 use ATB for it's battle system. We have 6 character and we choose 3 in combat, and there is about 6 role to master but every character only has 3 role in the beginning. In FF13 we can customize every character equipment, we can obtain the equipment from drop, or chest and then we can upgrade it too.<br>About level up system in FF13 it use something like experience, you get it and then spend it to boost stats or obtain certain abilities, but there aren't that many option to spend it, it's like a tree trunk with a few branches.<br>Combat system uses ATB as i mention before, we insert some command and then excecute it, and remember we can only control 1 character and we're free to choose. Also we can choose auto command in battle or repeat command to use your previous command.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">PRO<\/div>+ Great Story<br>+ Cool character<br>+ Voice acting is quite awesome<br>+ Main character is beautiful and cool<br>+ Soundtrack is wonderful<br>+ Many side quest, i haven't finished most of them but i think there are many of them<br>+ Setting is pretty good<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CONS<\/div>- Only road, the map is large but it's basically only a road<br>- Combat system is too passive, we can play it without thinking, just push the auto command in every battle<br>- Level up system is much less the same as they choose it for us even though they want us to boost our stats by ourselves<br>- Boring combat system<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CONCLUSION<\/div>If you're a story lover you definitely should play it, but if you like gameplay more than story i guess you shouldn't play it cause you might stop halfway, and i think even if you skip this game you can read the story in the next season, i mean FF 13-2. Well the main story isn't so hard to beat so enjoy it if you choose to play it. Hope it help you :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30891814', 'recent_short' );

I hope the bring back the Paradigm battle system in more titles.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30814454', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30814454' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30814454\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30814454' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30814454\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30814454', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30814454_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30814454_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30798512\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198178157062\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"217891334\">Komplex<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 24.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis and the whole XIII series of the Final Fantasy are the best :3 Sometimes i feel a bit tierd of the combats but then a new cutscene comes in and i'm just watching it like a little kid the a cartoon.

I really like the soundtracks\/music. Gameplay and story are alright. Battle system is pretty good. As this is a Final Fantasy RPG game, some grindings (and looking at walkthroughs) are required to get a 100% achievement. If you hate grinding, you don't need to try to get 100% achievement because I also found it tiresome \/ not worth doing. I spent about 200 hours in this game because I tried to get 100% completion and sometimes I was just idle, but you can finish the main story in about 50 hours.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30796568', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30796568' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30796568\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30796568' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30796568\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30796568', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30796568_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30796568_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30781347\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Z-95\/recommended\/292120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"33549319\">Z-95<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 83.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA fun game full of interesting and unique characters who are fighting to attempt to avoid or change their fate.
