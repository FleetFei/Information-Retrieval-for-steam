Though i might not be the best reviewer, since I normally dont make them, i read them. xD<br><br>My progress at the point of the review is, i have beaten the main game and are trying to find the hidden secrets, still left within the tower.<br><br>So, the gameplay itself if quite interesting, if one takes into account, this is an RPG Maker VX Ace game. Its a dungeon crawling type game, where one could skip enemies, if one has learned their moving patterns. You can expect to grind a bit though.<br><br>The fighting itself is really nice, though it does have some flaws. There are some enemies and mini bosses, who cant do anything, after they have less than 0.5 AP, making the fight impossible to lose.<br>This luckily doesnt happen to the main and secret bosses, since they can replenish their AP, even if their AP-regeneration has been debuffed.<br><br>The story itself is quite good, though, since i played other games by Neok, i know, he could have done better. Its just about, you and your teammates Karin, Mishika and Aeri, trying to find the secrets of the towers, wont spoil much more about this, since it does have some nice plots.<br><br>The music is nice, though some tracks can get a bit repetitive after a while.<br><br>And the art style, is well drawn, though here is the point, its somewhat anime oriented and might not suit everyone.<br><br><b> Last Words <\/b><br><br>Well, I do recommend that game to others, though it has it flaws and might not suit everyone with its gameplay and art style. For me personally, I think the 8,49\u20ac have been well spend. Its main game is long enough, to not get to repetitive, while actually staying fun.<br><br>For those, who are still unsure about this game, maybe check the playtrough of Hadriex, it might help to decided, if it worth it for you, or wait for a discount.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29529016', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29529016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29529016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29529016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29529016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29529016', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29529016_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29529016_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29624075\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hadriex\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"85619508\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f7911cb18350c0425d65428db48338c266cd338.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f7911cb18350c0425d65428db48338c266cd338.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1f7911cb18350c0425d65428db48338c266cd338_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hadriex\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85619508\">Hadriex<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hadriex\/games\/?tab=all\">49 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hadriex\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hadriex\/recommended\/572640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI find it difficult to describe this game.

Though it has some flaws, they're relatively few compared to all the strengths this game has.<br><br>It's a fairly rudamentary dungeon crawler, one that, as the description states, is heavily inspired by Etrian Odyssey.  The tower is split up into several areas, akin to EO's stratums, each with their own gimmicks and puzzles to solve.  The puzzles are pretty simple, but slowly grow more complex as the game continues on.  That said, never do they feel overwhelmingly difficult, so exploring the tower never slows to a crawl. The lack of random encounters only serves to make these puzzles more complex, akin to Etrian Odyssey's FOEs which served as tile movement puzzles.<br><br>The battle system is where the game truly shines.  Fake Happy End removes a lot of the drudgery that many RPGs fall into out of tradition, such as dwindling resources that you solve by either having an infinite number of recovery items, or by halting your progress and backtracking out to restart everything all over again.  Instead, all actions in battle cost action points, which constantly regenerate throughout battle and reset to half-full at the end of every fight.  This creates far more interesting battle scenarios, as having a pseudo-infinite amount of resources at all times allows for battles to be far more difficult and require more strategy than many RPGs, which tend to only have regular encounters as a sort of long-term battle of attrition designed to exhaust you for the inevitable boss at the end of dungeons.  With your resources starting from default at every fight, it lets you fight each battle with all you've got, and you'll need to in order to survive.  Enemies operate under the same rules, making the battle system feel fair in that respect as well.<br><br>Aside from skills naturally gained through level ups, skills are primarily gained by equipping elemental souls. Although the game categorizes its attacks according to elements, nowhere is there an elemental weakness\/resist system, so there's not even the suffering of random guessing to find a weakness.  Instead, the importance of elements comes from their secondary effects, such as stat debuffs or ailments.  Indeed, buffing and debuffing are very important, and picking the right sets of skills for each party member to make sure you can power yourself up and weaken enemies in the right way is the key to victory, as only defeat awaits you otherwise.<br><br>The basic description of this game's story is written in the store page, so I'll save you the trouble of repeating it here.  Overall, the story is fairly decent, though it can be pretty hit and miss at times.  The overall mystery of the tower and main plot of the game are solidly written, keeping you going until the end, but it preserves a light-hearted tone with plenty of amusing interactions between the main four characters.  More on the miss side are the lewd scenes, which feel thrown in for needless fanservice at the expense of derailing the pace the quick exploration of dungeons set.  The characters themselves also don't manage to quite feel that distinct, other than Aeri simply for being the voice of reason in the group.<br><br>The dating sim aspects of the game are also fairly rudimentary, with basic choices deciding which character you'll favor and ultimately end up dating towards the end of the game.  In some ways it's nice to have choices not be obtuse; helping out Karin gives you Karin points, while agreeing with Mishika gives you Mishika points, and so on.  On the other hand, it makes most choices lack subtlety and nuance, which could've gone a long way in making characters feel more distinct.  The characters do grow a decent amount as the game goes on, though I can't help but feel like there wasn't a good balance to their development, with one character feeling far more central to the plot than the others, making them feel underdeveloped as a result.<br><br>Overall, despite the sort of hit and miss nature of the story and its characters, there's enough to make you want to really sink your teeth into where the game shines, and that's the core gameplay.  Defying a lot of RPG conventions only makes you wish more of them had the uniqueness this game shows, and the fun I had searching out every last secret of the tower is something that'll stick with me for a while, if nothing else.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30726655', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30726655' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30726655\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30726655' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30726655\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30726655', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30726655_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30726655_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/572640\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 3 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29529016","29624075","30726655"]}
