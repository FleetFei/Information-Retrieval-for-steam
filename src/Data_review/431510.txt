Some of my favorite things about the game:<br><br>-I love that the MC has so much personality and has a backstory and issues of her own<br>-The art is amazing. Mystic Destinies is without a doubt the most visually stunning visual novel I've ever played. <br>-Great side characters!<br>-The music, particularly the softer music played during more emotionally driven scenes.<br>-There are dozens of facial expressions for all of the sprites, including side characters, that add so much personality to the characters. <br>-Takumi's route was my favorite but I also really loved Tatsuya's, and I think a lot of people would be able to relate to them.<br><br>It seems like a lot of the negative reviews here are based on the payment and game release structure which doesn't seem like a good metric to judge the actual game on, especially considering that there are a lot of episodic games out there right now that are purchased the same way as this one, but cost much more.  I also think it's unnecessary and unhelpful to negatively review a game because you thought you were getting the whole game for free but only got a demo. <br><br>Aside from all of that, I am 100% in support of the three women behind Aeon Dream Studios who are making the kind of content I never knew I was looking for.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30345448', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30345448' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30345448\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30345448' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30345448\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30345448', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30345448_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30345448_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30468006\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198274029230\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"313763502\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cf\/cf80e9288f3be5e4e8e4c02b54df45944b25591c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cf\/cf80e9288f3be5e4e8e4c02b54df45944b25591c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cf\/cf80e9288f3be5e4e8e4c02b54df45944b25591c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198274029230\/\" data-miniprofile=\"313763502\">nini<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198274029230\/games\/?tab=all\">23 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198274029230\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198274029230\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOkay, I wanted to wait until I've played through every possibly ending from every route, but, I just couldn't wait because y'all need to know that this game. Is freaking. Amazing. Hands down, the beST visual novel I've ever had the opportunity to experience. 1 MILLION\/10 would recommend oh my god. <br>Phew. With that out of the way, I'll give a more thorough review of the game and what it has to offer.<br><br>MUSIC: 9\/10; this game has a dynamic, scintillating soundtrack that changes and flows with the mood of the story as it progresses. The songs aren't too busy that they distract you from reading, in fact, they support the words. I found myself easily picturing and creating in my mind the scenes before me. Certain tracks are repeated, but, I don't mind. It did get a tiny bit old after the third route, but, with Takumi's route, there were some pretty sexy saxophone tunes that I really enjoyed. Hopefully with the release of Hikaru's route, there will be new music added as well.<br><br>ART: 20\/10; what first drew me in from the very beginning browsing the store was the artwork. the art is more realistic, as opposed to the usual manga\/anime style drawings you find in other otomes. I found that very refreshing, and I was able to relate to the characters more deeply because of that. The sprites are immaculate, each with countless different expressions, including side characters, that really helped solidify the emotions protrayed in the plot. The backgrounds are polished and vibrant. Everything about this game is so aesthetically pleasing, I'm seriously so amazed by the hard work the developers must have put in to make this game look so good.<br><br>PLOT: I loved how each route you took was completely different in regards to pacing and character development, yet, they all occured within the same functioning universe. It always made me curious as to how the other characters solved their particular dilemma without the main character there to help them. For example: what happened to Tatsuya's <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>family and his mother's cafe without MC to encourage Tatsuya to overcome Katsu?<\/span><\/span> Or what about <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Caro and his obsession with MC and her power? (in Shou's route)<\/span><\/span> I'm the type of person who wants to know all the details, so, I'm left wondering.<br><br>TATSUYA: talk about tsundere, oh my goodness, my all time weakness. I am proud to say that I got the Mystic Ending on my first try. When I went in search of guides, I saw people were having trouble, but, I guess I love tsunderes too much that I'm an expert at getting them to like me in otomes. I have to say, in terms of character development and substance, Tatsuya's route has to be my favorite. Not just because his character troupe is my kryptonite, but, because it was long enough that I was able to get to know almost every aspect of his life. I teared up a few times, I won't lie. I loved slowly breaking down Tatsuya's walls and seeing the mushy man inside.<br><br>SHOU: okay, I usually don't like the ditzy, happy virus types, but, Shou was pretty much the exact opposite of Tatsuya (literally if you look at their powers). I went into his route prepared to be indifferent, but, I actually fell in love with him. He's so pure and honest, he wears his heart on his sleeve, simply precious. I was disappointed that his route was so short compared to the others, especially right after having played through Tatsuya's monster of a route (16 chapters total). I found myself wanting to go deeper and wanting to know more about Shou and the intricacies of his creature community (again, much like we do in Tatsuya's route). But, I took it in stride, and it was still an enjoyable route.<br><br>SHINJI: Shinji was a bit of a wild card to me. I didn't really know what kind of character he was going to be, and, going through his route and getting to know him, I still don't quite understand him. He's very closed off, but still very polite. It took forever to get to the real him, pretty much the last chapter <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>even though he and MC had sex multiple times in earlier chapters, I swear, no otome I've played has had that many sex scenes I was both amused and annoyed<\/span><\/span> is when the real Shinji appears. I changed MC's name to Miku, which was funny because Shinki's mother's name is Miki, so, there were a few mixups on my part lol.<br><br>TAKUMI: talk about a total change of pace, rollercoaster, whirlwind of emotions all at once. Cheese and crackers, Takumi's route felt like I was playing a completely different game than the other three, I'm not even kidding. I could tell without checking that the same person wrote Takumi and Tatsuya's routes, because of writing style, and length, and how they went in depth for every aspect of the plot, including side characters, which I greatly appreciated. Action packed, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. If I didn't have to go to work, I'd have plowed through the entire route in one sitting. I adore Takumi. He's funny, adorable, and stubborn. A little like Tatsuya in that sense, but more like an overgrown puppy. I found his route to be the saddest, however, in the end, even if it was 'happy'. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Because, Takumi is the only human MC ends up with, which means he'll eventually die, and that's just so sad to think about :((<\/span><\/span><br><br>HIKARU: Since this is my first review, I'm not sure if I'm able to edit this after I've played Hikaru's route when it's released, but, I'll definitely be back to post my thoughts on that. I seriously cannot wait, I'm waiting with bated breath because I have a feeling his route is going to be epic.<br><br>TL;DR I HANDS DOWN RECOMMEND THIS GAME. PURCHASING THE ROUTES IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.

I do have some problems despite it being a game that I would still recommend<br><br><br>HUGE DISCLAIMER: Despite what it says on the page the game is not free. After the prolouge, you need to purchase the routes as &quot;DLCs&quot;, rather than making a full purchace. So if you do not like this payment model, do yourself a favour and save yourself from disappointment. This review will also have spoilers so please don't read this if you don't want spoilers.<br><br>Coming in, I think I had very low expectations because I find it difficult to find an otome game I am completely satisfied with. I wasn't really a fan of the art style, however after sleuthing around and finding their concept art and Go Fund Me pages, I felt a new appreciation for it. You can tell that a lot of thought and effort went into their character design. The motions are very fluid and the colours used are very beautiful. The stills on their own are even better: I don't really have much to complain about art-wise. <br><br>However, I have noticed some of the backdrops they used are recycled and have been used in some other games. I guess I can understand because they are on a budget, but the consistancy was a little off. I felt as if Takumi's route had higher quality, more unique backdrops whereas Tatsuya only had one or two which were unique to his story. <br><br>That being said, the story telling is very good. I may have just been biased towards Tatsuya, but I felt his story was a lot better than Takumi's. Shou's was also good, but not as good as Tatsuya's<br><br>Here's why: I feel as if the story is far too focused on him and not enough on the main character. We know that she gives up her studies and any relationship she has with her family all to persue her mother, but it never ends up happening. Instead, we only see Takumi's problems: trying to find out how to cure his comatose brother and getting revenge on the people responsible. While it's good that they don't shy away from themes such as substance abuse, I can't help but question the way that they went about it. I was left feeling the character to be weak-willed, when I wanted to empathise with him. Even towards the end, there's no resolution to him &quot;shooting-up&quot; enchancement drugs, let alone mention of it. You see one major relapse in the story, then after the resolution, it's assumed he's suddenly okay. That bothered me. I feel as though they were attempting to make the character edgy, but it fell short because we're not shown anything else substansial to his problem. Is he going to go to a magical rehab? Does his parents know? How would they react? Why isn't Tsubasa doing anything about it? All these things aren't even answered and it's unrealistic to leave these things out. Making Takumi the &quot;rebel&quot; felt like a double-edged sword. They wanted to add more to his character, but they are spreading themselves too thin and have bitten off more than they can chew.<br>Maybe they go more into detail in his Epilogue and it is more geared towards the main character. If this is the case, that would make it a little better, but I felt a huge lack of closure in Takumi's route in comparision to Tatsuya's or Shou's. I was honestly expecting his to be the best route with how hyped it was, but I ended up liking it the least. <br><br>That being said, I was still amazed by how engaged I was by the story, and the originality of the world and characters it portrayed. Even though it's a romance sim, I felt like I was getting so much more than that. The characters felt authentic, raw and no-nonsense. Even though this is fiction, the characters deal with very real problems, and I found it very easy to relate to them. <br>The opening for the game was absolutely heart-stopping. I loved the ambiance it gave to the entire game and it completely drew me in.<br><br>However, I do have a problem with the pricing. While it is worth the money, I didn't like the model they used. It's typical of the Google Play\/ IOS platforms you see (Stuff like Voltage Inc.). It's not a big criticism, and I get they probably need as much financial support as possible, but it feels like they are ripping me off. I would have liked the option to pay the game in full, like the other titles on this site, rather than pay $7+ on each character's prologue and epilogue. Again, I understand they are releasing the routes individually, but I would have perferred to wait and have the option to buy the full game.<br>A lot of content is nice, but it felt too dragged out and long. It would have been nicer if they divided it into more chapters rather than me sitting there for more than 30 minutes just to get though one chapter. Maybe that's just my personal preference.<br><br>Overall this is a stellar game for the indie community. It's good enough to compete with giants such as Otomate and Cheritz.<br>My loyalty is still to Tatsuya, and I highly recommend his story. I Felt Shou's was pretty soild and pleasant to read as well. Takumi's on the other hand is darker and a lot more confronting so if you are okay with drama and angst then it's okay. For me it wasn't really my cup of tea.<br><br>I look forward to playing Echos, but I hope they make a second season for these characters. I look forward to reading Hikaru's route when they finally release it. I hope they continue to add and layer this really cool world they created. I find it phenomenal that only 3 people created something this high quality. I would love to pledge, but I don't really have the money for it.<br><br>If you're not afraid to spend a little money for a great story, this is definitely something to consider.<br><br>(p.s thank you for putting a megane love interest in this game)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30697416', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30697416' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30697416\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30697416' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30697416\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30697416', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30697416_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30697416_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30397175\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299209187\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"338943459\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3af3f6242045093538fd00cf7f47b5375545d8fe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3af3f6242045093538fd00cf7f47b5375545d8fe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3af3f6242045093538fd00cf7f47b5375545d8fe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299209187\/\" data-miniprofile=\"338943459\">tenesedra<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299209187\/games\/?tab=all\">18 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299209187\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299209187\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">38.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10\/10<br>Best visual novel I have read so far!

That being what it is I felt that writing a review of this game from the perspective of someone who is a fan of the genre was necessary.<br> <br>First and foremost I can't get over how lovely the art is. Sprites, backgrounds, and CG's are all beautiful! It is very obvious that a lot of love and attention to detail was put into the visuals of this game, and the style is something new and refreshing. Also, the music is suprisingly great as well. The writing was really solid. The dialogue is believable. Characters have defined personalities and the plot is pretty interesting (I have seen the supernatural theme come up in a lot of otome games but the story has it's own world and lore makes it just a notch above other games with a similar theme) and the writing was pretty sound grammatically too and was void of any glaring typos. If a game of this genre has all of these things it is already superior to 90% of the games that are out there. <br><br>I have seen some complaints from other reviewers with the way the game is being distributed with the prologue and sneak peek of each route being free, and each full route being availible for individual sale as they are released. I for one don't mind this. I feel that each route is long enough that the price per route is fair, and if it allows me to play each route sooner since I don't have to wait for the whole game to be completed then I don't really see what the big deal is. If every route is just as long as Shou's route, there will be hours of play time for each character route, with multiple endings for each one. <br><br>To be honest I am pretty hyped up to play the routes as they become availible. I think this is shaping up to be a really great game!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21378530', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21378530' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21378530\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21378530' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21378530\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21378530', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21378530_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21378530_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24216706\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ensignr7\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"85270436\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c57178746f2ede82d19cdfd7af1e22b87be7aaab.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c57178746f2ede82d19cdfd7af1e22b87be7aaab.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c57178746f2ede82d19cdfd7af1e22b87be7aaab_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ensignr7\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85270436\">Tch.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ensignr7\/games\/?tab=all\">1,211 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ensignr7\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ensignr7\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo be honest I was disappointed when I read that I'd have to pay for each route after the prologue (I play quite a few mobile games like this and it's ok I suppose but it wasn't something I was expecting to see as a pc game) and as much as I enjoyed the prologue and first chapter I didn't buy the main stories straight away for this reason- nothing to do with the actual game itself, t'was just me being stingy.<br>Spending time playing other Otome games made me want to come back to this and give it another shot, (I guess it also helped that I had some spare monies!) So I bought all the stories available and fired it up.<br><br>Well I am so glad that I did! After playing through each story and epilogue I can quite honestly say it's one of the better Otome's available on Steam at the moment.<br><br>I loved the writing; it draws you in and really makes you feel like a part of the world. The 2 available guys both have equally fascinating stories, (although I have to say I loved Tatsuya and his route just that bit more than Shou) and I didn't once feel like cringing or rolling my eyes at their actions\/words unlike some games I've recently played. This game has such a lovely wholesome feeling to it even with Chisaki and her comments.<br>The artwork is amazing- it's soft and colourful and just really really beautiful, and I don't just mean the characters, the scenery in this game is equally as lovely and I found myself admiring the details in the backgrounds more than once.<br>The music is also very fitting and I instantly fell in love; it's very mystical in itself and adds that finishing touch to a great game. I really really want a soundtrack of some sort so that I can listen to it when i'm away from my computer- I found the opening song on spotify and have listened to it non stop for a few hours already...<br><br>I haven't any cons for this game yet and I hopefully won't with it's further releases. I initially didn't like having to buy the routes separately, but I've since found out why it's been released this way and it makes perfect sense. Plus it's too good of a game for that to be an issue and it certainly won't stop me from buying Shinji's route in August. I really can't wait to find out all about him and the others in the coming months. Keep up the good work!!<br><br>Edit; Soooo Shinji's route was pretty amazing too! Really loved the way his story played out, well written as usual and kept me hooked right until the end. The epilogue is nice, a bit short but I can't remember if they're all like that or not?<br><br>Roll on Takumi's route... whenever it get's released! ;) I'm hoping the extra time they're taking for his route means it'll be extra amazing. Although I'm certain it will be anyway. C'mon guy..

A lot. This one immediately stands out to me because of the beautiful coloring and linework, and the incredible backgrounds. I can tell a lot of time and effort went into making this game. The music is STELLAR! I'll update this review once I've finished Shou's route and have more to say.<br><br>Yes, you do have to buy each route. At $5 a route(sold as DLC) for 5 total routes, this amounts to $25 which is a pretty standard price as far as quality visual novels go. Cheritz's games (Dandelion and Nameless) run for about $28 each. If you enjoyed this game I highly recommend checking those out as well!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21422504', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21422504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21422504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21422504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21422504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21422504', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21422504_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21422504_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29186734\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gotchibi\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"160082573\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/dbd1411cc8e7a009a37c3bddf19b865ffa68745e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/dbd1411cc8e7a009a37c3bddf19b865ffa68745e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/db\/dbd1411cc8e7a009a37c3bddf19b865ffa68745e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gotchibi\/\" data-miniprofile=\"160082573\">\u2729 Helen\u03b1 \u2729<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gotchibi\/games\/?tab=all\">569 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gotchibi\/recommended\/\">328 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gotchibi\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">27.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love this game so much.

I don't expect any of them to be the same, that being said, here's what I think of the game from playing the Shou route, and sneaking a peek at the others too.<br><br>I think this game is really interesting and cute. The story kept me wanting to play more (so I'm a little bummed that I can't play the other routes yet, but I'll be sooooo excited when the Takumi route is available :P ), and the characters themselves are really interesting. <br><br>I like how all the guys aren't just hitting on the main girl character constantly. I find that to be a bit irritating in some games. None of the guys look the same, they all have their own personalities, and none of them seem to be overbearing as far as personality goes. <br><br>I can't wait for the next routes. I recommend this game to anyone who likes visual novels. :&gt;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21540305', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21540305' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21540305\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21540305' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21540305\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21540305', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21540305_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21540305_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21640387\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127237377\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"166971649\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c33850a1781b03a86b7f6188414ef778615f83f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c33850a1781b03a86b7f6188414ef778615f83f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c33850a1781b03a86b7f6188414ef778615f83f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127237377\/\" data-miniprofile=\"166971649\">\u2702\ufe0eDeathWish\u272f<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127237377\/games\/?tab=all\">22 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127237377\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198127237377\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAwesome visual novel game.

I love each and every character. How every character is different with different conflicts and in every character routes you could gain different informations that could solve your personal problem. I really love the soundtrack as it compliments every scene very well and brings the right emotion for the players to feel during specific scenes. I surely didn't regret buying all of the routes. I hope the developer would continue adding more and more chapters to this game as i am starting to get really fixated on this game.( you could say obsessed as i replay every route like every night :) ) I would really recommend this game to everyone.

A friend and I played this to just pass the time, not thinking much of it at the time, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the stories are executed in this game. Each one is unique and keeps you wanting more. I highly reccomend this game for whoever is really wanting an adventerous story! I'm eagerly looking forward to what Aeon Dream Studios has instore for the future!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29658870', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29658870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29658870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29658870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29658870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29658870', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29658870_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29658870_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29535499\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198303504625\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"343238897\">willafield93<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 228.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love the game, everything to the artwork to the storylines. It\u2019s a lot different than my other games that I pay, but something\u2019s drawn me to it\u2014I think it was both my friends\u2019 recommendation and the artwork\u2014and I am so glad that I bought this game. I also love the fact each story will have multiple seasons we could play far after the first story; I love that we will see more of the boys and how Ena [my character] copes with the major things that happened in the first story. If you love fantasy in a different light and deep stories, put up this game\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29535499', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29535499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29535499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29535499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29535499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29535499', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29535499_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29535499_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29475355\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Springfall\/recommended\/431510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"65278144\">\u25b3 Gucci \u25b3<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29475355', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29475355' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29475355\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29475355' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29475355\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29475355', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29475355_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29475355_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/431510\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 240 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30345448","30468006","30697416","30397175","21378530","24216706","21422504","29186734","21540305","21640387"]}
