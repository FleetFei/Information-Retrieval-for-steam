The campaign itself is about 5ish hours long and sort of encourages re-starts. In fact it has a survival version of that campaign that has reward tiers and a leaderboard that refreshes weekly. In addition to a daily challenge. <br><br>Removed from that is the game itself. Procedurally generated levels with a few objectives, generally kill the Lieutenant (or a sort of Elite enemy) or destroy some crystal structure that usually is well defended. There are some boss battles as well but they aren't the main show. <br><br>This game is very similar to a onion. Lots of layers and under those even more. There are two campaigns but the story is mildly irrelevant and blas\u00e9. I'll attempt to surmise it quickly; Angels and Demons don't like each other. You as the player don't actually aim which may seem a bit silly on it's face but this game is kind of chaotic especially in later levels. It becomes much more closely related to a Bullet Hell game where you're sort of dispensing any damage you can whilst mostly dodging enemy attacks. <br><br>There are Blessings \u2013 which are the most \u201croguish\u201d of the mechanics. Gained on a level up, specific to each run of the campaign. You select one of four and then upgrade those throughout. Once selected they cannot be undone within that campaign. These effect things such as chilled bullets or holy damaged AoE effects on jumps among other things. They are randomly introduced so waiting for one you want may be a better option than using one of the slots for an ability you don't care for. <br><br>The other leveling has more of a permanence. Oaths, Transmutations and Miracles. Once unlocked, they stay unlocked and remain consistent through each campaign. Transmutations being the second most roguish mechanic. While unlocking them is permanent they provide no permanent effect to the player, only those things unlocked become available randomly in lockers and chests found in the levels. <br><br>Oaths require shards to be crafted and applied to different areas either offensively or defensively, these however behave similarly to the Blessings but are more permanent. Miracles are the active abilities, set on cooldowns they need to be crafted as well using components found mostly from enemy drops. There are a ton of components. Luckily you don't need to actually pay attention to which ones you need as they come fast and furious.<br><br>There is also a mechanic called Rebirth. Which differ from what are called Resurrections; resurrections essentially equate to lives per level. Death incurring the penalty <span class=\"bb_strike\">like Dark Souls II<\/span> of lowered max health. Three deaths and it's game over. However this penalty is removed by completing the objective and moving on. There are also checkpoints which are usually behind a timed door section that behave very much in a similar fashion to Spleunky with it's cave shortcuts. Now, Rebirth on the other hand is for all intents and purposes a \u201cPrestige\u201d mode. Removing all other upgrades for some base character upgrades and the process is started over. <br><br>I hesitate to call it a MetroidVania as those traditionally have item or ability gates that make you backtrack however <b>Seraph<\/b> being procedurally generated has none of these nor is anything blocked by a specific ability. <br><br><b>THE GIST<br>While the game is not mechanically unique it plays very well. Given definition by its easy to play, hard to master mentality. You may gas out on it in long stretches but it's easy to come back to because of the familiarity of the mechanics.<\/b><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/curator\/25764029\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" ><i>Follow my curation page for more.<\/i><\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30363059', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30363059' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30363059\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30363059' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30363059\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30363059', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30363059_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30363059_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30355422\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Whitetailfox\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"68463172\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/636c7b2968be87f6878296b61402e32522408404.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/636c7b2968be87f6878296b61402e32522408404.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/636c7b2968be87f6878296b61402e32522408404_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Whitetailfox\/\" data-miniprofile=\"68463172\">Whitetailfox<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Whitetailfox\/games\/?tab=all\">160 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Whitetailfox\/recommended\/\">33 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Whitetailfox\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">66.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo put it simply you basically get what the trailer shows and it's very well done.<br><br>Game is basically a 2D sidescrolling action rpg with the emphasis more on the action part. That means player skill at dodging and anticipating enemy attacks while returning fire is pretty much key to survival here. Game is thus very skill-based with the RPG aspect being in collecting items that help you upgrade your gear, progressing in levels and swapping out abilities.<br><br>The basic game is really simple: you're dropped into a level with the goal of either defeating a boss enemy or a bunch of stationary enemy spawners. After that is done you reach the exist, collect your xp, level and upgrade and move on to the next level. While this seems like it would get repetitive fast, Seraph does a huge ammount with this simple concept.<br><br>Then there's dynamic difficulty system. If you're collecting disproportionately more xp to the ammount of times you're supposed to be hit, the game starts gradually upping its difficulty, with the rate of difficulty climb increasing as your xp gains go even higher. Difficulty in this case means enemies getting faster, with higher damage, faster attacks with decreased window to dodge, enemies now having whole new attacks and new types of enemies appearing entirely. It also increases the rate of appearance of elite enemies and the special abilities those are spawned with. In practice this means that even with good gear and breezing through a bunch of levels easily, you will be encountering enemies that will challenge you again.<br><br>Here also lies one of the most frustrating parts, while the difficulty of enemies rises in accordance to your performance in dealing wit them, the levels and their architecture is randomly put together, as are the boss enemies which are extremely buffed normal types with some powerful extra abilities tacked on. It is thus through this random generation process possible to encounter a boss encounter or a group of elites you just won't have much a chance to realistically dodge or deal with. Whereas other times the architecture can allow you to cheese an enemy who would normally be a huge pain to deal with in open areas. Basically its possible to spawn at a level and immediately be met with several elites and very little room to retreat to although its also not something that happens a lot either, its not something that ruins the game, just frustrates and slows progress.<br><br>It also stands to point out you can newgame+ if you get stuck or go into challenge mode to earn upgrades and thus make the base game easier as they carry over in between modes. Challenge mode particularly allows you to earn rare crafting materials, although nothing is exclusive to it and surprisingly no micro transactions or anything of the sort, beyond a few cosmetics.<br><br>To sum it up, great game that seems simple but has depth and keeps itself challenging. Game is ironically the most boring at the starting few levels before the difficulty picks up, after that I was too busy fighting gradually more difficult and creative enemies to notice that every level has the same objective.<br><br>Definitely worth a buy.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30355422', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30355422' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30355422\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30355422' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30355422\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30355422', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30355422_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30355422_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30751663\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xoxsubzeroxox\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83672349\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/197223a7528f6690e79304ddcc12df952e3ff85d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/197223a7528f6690e79304ddcc12df952e3ff85d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/197223a7528f6690e79304ddcc12df952e3ff85d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xoxsubzeroxox\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83672349\">Seraph<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xoxsubzeroxox\/games\/?tab=all\">878 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xoxsubzeroxox\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xoxsubzeroxox\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSeraph is a very enjoyable 2D action platformer if you like fast-paced skill-based action, procedural generation of levels and enemies, account-wide upgrades through crafting with materials gotten from drops and daily\/weekly leaderboards for daily challenges and weekly survival runs.<br><br>The plot features strong Heaven and Hell themes, but not tied to a specific religion as Heaven is referred to as Origin and Hell as Terminus. Seraph is stuck in a human vessel in Reality, which is just the earthly realm, after having been imprisoned there for three decades. All of a sudden its prison opens, only to see the facility it was imprisoned in to be overrun with Daemons from the Terminus. Seraph must now slay hordes of Daemons which all have a little bit of its essence in them, to regain its power and be able to return to Origin. Some type of dark magic has Seraph trapped in its vessel, and if it dies, Seraph dies too.<br><br>I like the plot and how you slowly uncover the truth and come across some twists as you progress through it. It was all fine except for the end, which offers a choice and no follow-up on that choice or any clear ending at all. I'm fine with open endings, but this one didn't lead up to any outcome at all so it's just too open. A few lines of dialogue after the choice at the end could have gone a long way in this.<br><br>I get that story was never this game's main focus, but the gameplay was. And luckily it's good enough to carry the lacklustre ending, as it's easy to enjoy the game a lot without even paying any mind to the plot. The combat is fast-paced and aims to deliver a challenge customized to every player's skill level with its difficulty scaling. Essentially, it will keep increasing, but more so if you don't get hit a lot and are having an easy time overall, as it will try to compensate for that by increasing enemy health and damage as well as adding more elite forms with different attacks and more aggressive enemy behaviour. This system isn't perfect, however, because despite it increasing if you're doing well or have good gear, it will not lower once you eventually hit a wall where it's too hard and you would have to restart. Higher difficulties give better drops, so it's still good to push as high as possible. Your main means of defeating Daemons are your dual pistols which have endless ammunition, but you can find secondary weapons such as a shotgun, an assault rifle or dual SMGs which generally perform better but will run out of ammo. You don't actually have to aim your weapons, as the game auto-aims to your nearest target, which I'm glad about because the gameplay is already hectic enough with all the attacks you have to avoid. Besides guns Seraph also has access to its Miracles, which are activated abilities on a cool down timer. These you do have to aim manually.<br><br>The fast-paced and fun nature of the combat is greatly amplified by the game's movement system. Not only can you double jump, you also get two charges of a dash which recharge quickly. So you can jump at least four times before hitting the ground, and also stick to walls for a bit before starting to slide down. Dashing and jumping around and through enemies and off of walls while casting Miracles and unloading guns is just so much fun. Seraph is also animated acrobatically, for example doing an airborne cartwheel while shooting at an enemy below it.<br><br>During the levels, you will either have to kill a Lieutenant or destroy several Fountains of Terminus to unlock the door and progress to the next one. You can choose to rush through and go for the objective, as it is always highlighted, but you can also explore thoroughly and increase you amount of drops and experience you get. Each level also has a locked area you can unlock, which will have some containers and a buff to either increase your toughness, damage or experience gain and could make the objective easier. <br><br>As for character progression, there are lots of account-wide upgrades through slotting shards of various rarities into Oaths for a bunch of stat bonuses and a transmutation system where you can craft new or improved versions of guns, Miracles and Wards with all sorts of materials dropped by enemies. There is also a levelling up system which is tied to the specific run and is lost when you end a story playthrough, start a new one or die in Survival mode. If you really want to push it, you can even Rebirth up to five times, which requires a set amount of the highest quality of shard and resets all of your progress for a slight base increase in some stats. I feel like the stat increases should be a little higher because now it hardly feels worth how long it takes to get to a Rebirth and then get back up to the point you were at to even notice the barely increased stats.<br><br>I'm also a fan of the way the game looks. The flashy combat, the Miracles' nice visual effects and every tile set looking great all make for a very visually pleasing game.<br><br>If you're into end-game and grinding, you can keep coming back every day for the daily challenges and get rewards depending on the tier you ended up in, and do high-level runs to farm up a lot of shard fragments and crafting materials. Unfortunately someone with way higher stats and many more upgrades than a new player will have a big advantage over them aside from skill, so it's not entirely fair.<br><br>All in all, I've really enjoyed the game so far and I still want to play a lot more to get better and gear my character out to make getting leaderboard positions easier. However if I didn't want to do any of the end-game and competitive aspect of it but only cared for doing a single playthrough, it would have only lasted me three or four hours, which is still worth it for the price but a sale discount would make it much more so.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30751663', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30751663' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30751663\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30751663' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30751663\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30751663', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30751663_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30751663_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30778819\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198088938245\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"128672517\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94911ef404acb12bfc1f9191cf005ac861b8a3ae.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94911ef404acb12bfc1f9191cf005ac861b8a3ae.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94911ef404acb12bfc1f9191cf005ac861b8a3ae_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198088938245\/\" data-miniprofile=\"128672517\">Validus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198088938245\/games\/?tab=all\">197 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198088938245\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198088938245\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTaking on the role of an angel possessing a human body, you and your host have just escaped from prison and are trying to make sense of your surroundings as you leave the facility. The angel is not the only unearthly entity to have come to Earth however, and this is where the action and the story begins.<br><br>This is a fluid side-scrolling 2D platform shooting game, with the emphasis on acrobatic movement and dodging. Using your angelic powers, called miracles or blessings, it is possible to do double jumps, mini-teleports, force away projectiles\/ foes and a number of other divine actions to smite your demonic enemies. This is combined with earthly forms of combat, using a range of firearms, to create a combat system that has a fair level of flexibility and options, but is not overly complicated. When combined with the platform aspect of the game, you can pull off some amazing stunts and gravity defying acrobatics. As movement and dodging is the primary concern, aiming is automatic and needs very little input, often needing none at all. <br><br>The objective after arriving on the level is to either destroy multiple static objects or the 'Lieutenant' demon before making your way to the exit. This is repeated throughout the enitre length of the game, so you need to be comfortable with this very basic premise. The exceptions are the 2 boss levels which are just an outright shoot\/dodge session. <br><br>The difficulty of the foes you face is scaled with how well you are playing. The less damage you take, the more difficult it becomes. I think this works really well, keeping you challenged but never really facing an impossible enemy. Bosses are still bosses though! To counter the difficulty, character progression is through the acquisition of divine shards that can be used to enhance an aspect of the character, such as speed, or give a minor advantage, such as increased ammo drops. In addition to this is the transmutation ability where you improve the equipment you are using. All of these improvements are done at an account level, so even if you are having trouble, you can restart, keeping your character progression, and you will eventually overpower it.<br><br>Positive:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The developers are very active on the forums and interact with their customers better than any others I have encountered. On the strength of this I bought one of their other games to support them!<br><\/li><li> Very, very smooth and responsive gameplay.<br><\/li><li> Well designed character progression, allowing you to play the game the way you like.<br><\/li><li> Daily and Weekly competitive challenge events.<br><\/li><li> Conceptually very basic but brilliantly executed and enjoyable.<br><\/li><li> Achievements are balanced and reward progression through the game, until a tough few at the end that require a grind and practice<\/li><\/ul>Negative:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Combat can sometimes occur off-screen, and it is possible to drop into a group of enemies who will strike you before you spot them, let alone dodge. Given the pace and scale of the game, this is expected but frustrating.<br><\/li><li> Could do with a little more variety on level objectives. Only having 2 is not really enough.<br><\/li><li> Has plenty of lore in the logs, but the story is lacking. The story comes second to the action, but then,  nobody ever said otherwise.<\/li><\/ul>Conclusion:<br><br>Smooth, slick and stylish. Well balanced from beginning to end, the game rewards skill and the ability to learn from your mistakes. It also offers enough variety (just) to make it replayable. As there is a lot of repeating aspects to this game, this was necessary, but could put off some people who want more depth from a game.<br><br>Take it as you see it. Basic, but done very well. A well crafted piece of action gunplay with divine aspects thrown in to mix it up and give it flavour.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>It is plastered everywhere, but needs to be stated again as it really is a must. <u>Use a controller.<\/u> The game is many times more enjoyable with one and vastly frustrating without.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30778819', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30778819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30778819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30778819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30778819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30778819', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30778819_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30778819_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25614111\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970313982\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10048254\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/14653745a14a8074079463170008c542e67da418.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/14653745a14a8074079463170008c542e67da418.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/14653745a14a8074079463170008c542e67da418_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970313982\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10048254\">ADS<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970313982\/games\/?tab=all\">320 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970313982\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970313982\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTLDR: Buy it.<br><br>I had no idea this game existed until I saw it released from early access today, and picked it up on a whim and have been very pleasantly surprised.  It's a very slick action oriented platformer that's a ton of fun to play.  If you have any interest in difficult platformers, pick this up, it's an absolute steal.<br><br>Positives:<br>Adaptive difficulty - I *love* this feature, if I'm playing well I get better rewards and things ramp up.<br>Refined movement - Double jump and and a dash with invicibility frames really lets you flit around and dodge like a madman, when you're in the zone it's a ton of fun.<br>No aiming - As weird as it sounds, I actually like the fact you don't have to aim, it makes concentrating 100% on movement possible.<br>Daily\/Weekly challenges - There are challenges which reward high level upgrade items in game if you do well in the rankings, which keeps things interesting and provides incentives to keep improving.<br>Enemy\/Item compendium - The pics\/info on the enemies is really cool and helps provide some background to the story.<br><br>Negatives:<br>Backgrounds can be tough to differentiate - At times it's hard to tell if something is the ceiling or an opening you can jump through.<br>Unexplained mechanics - A lot of the mechanics in the game are left up to you to figure out, the loading tips are useful but there's no manual or any detailed explanations for what everything in the game does.<br><br>Summary:<br>I love platformers and buy a ton of them, this is one of the best I've played in a long time.  Highly recommended.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25614111', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25614111' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25614111\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25614111' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25614111\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25614111', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25614111_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25614111_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25701201\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"83963746\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26af27637b7871ac2a330371835aba7c6c3cf0cc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26af27637b7871ac2a330371835aba7c6c3cf0cc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26af27637b7871ac2a330371835aba7c6c3cf0cc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83963746\">A dude named JJ<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/games\/?tab=all\">1,030 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/recommended\/\">99 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198044229474\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity engine, done right.

You also have an upgrade system like that of an action-RPG, where enemies drop resources that can be used to improve your weapons, spells (&quot;Miracles&quot;), and special limited-durability items that are the closest thing you get to armor.  In addition, your character gains passive buffs, either from gathering the game's equivalent of experience points or from using special items called Shards, which interact with Seraph's three skill trees--Munitions, Defensive (which I recommend focusing on first, because your very limited health needs all the increases it can get) and Holy, which is a mix of offensive and defensive bonuses.  Shards work similarly to combining metal in Team Fortress 2: three of Shard A makes Shard B, which is stronger; three of Shard B makes Shard C and so on, and Shard strengths and rarities are represented through colors, similarly to a loot system.<br><br>The game doesn't really &quot;have&quot; a loot system per se, as other than finding resources and Shards that enemy Daemons drop, you are responsible for what you want to earn and upgrade.  You can't make crafting decisions while you're in the middle of playing a section, but you can do so in between levels, as well as (smartly) from the main menu, which comes in handy if you know you're facing one big enemy instead of many little ones.  However, you also don't have true weapon loadouts: other than your dual auto-pistols, which are always with you and are your only infinite-ammo weapon, you can carry a second weapon by gathering one from numerous lockers spread throughout the game.  Which weapon you get--shotgun, assault rifle, submachine gun, railgun--is randomly generated, though some lockers might instead just offer extra ammo for the one you already have.  Weapons don't have randomly generated prefixes or suffixes that determine their capabilities, so their power generally depends on your investments into upgrading their stats.  Don't neglect your pistols, as they're invaluable when your stronger weapons run out of ammo.<br><br>Even basic enemies can severely damage Seraph, and health pick-ups are very rare and rather meager when they do appear; in some cases these will barely replenish the equivalent of taking one hit.  The game's central mechanic is its 360\u00ba evade system, whose two quickly recharging uses also function as a quadruple jump.  You're meant to rely on the invincibility frames this gives you.  Seraph targets enemies automatically and is generally smart enough to prioritize the close ones, though you can also lock onto them if you want the camera to focus on enemies instead of you.  At times I'd like to zoom the camera out before blindly jumping into an area I can't really &quot;scout out&quot; beforehand.  Along with replenished health, you get three lives per level, each of which having a significantly smaller maximum health than the one before it, so you effectively have 200% health spread over three lives.  Lose all of those, and--this was forewarned but may turn a lot of customers away--you resurrect at the last checkpoint you activated, even if it was in a previous level.  Many levels, which individually are small despite their nonlinear design, have secret areas that have these checkpoints and health\/gun\/ammo refills, so after you complete an area, you might not want to make a beeline for the exit without also looking for a secret checkpoint, unless you're already about to die.  The game's few major boss fights thankfully auto-save at their beginnings.<br><br>You can also find text logs, and for its genre the game actually bothers to tell a decent story; its writing style is flowery yet sometimes vague, but the story tries to be more complex than just a straight good-versus-evil tale despite its techno-religious motif.  It's even a bit touching when it's not being cynical.  These logs, which can be read during gameplay or accessed from the main menu, do a good job of setting up the complex relationships of the game's small cast, especially between Seraph and &quot;its\/their&quot; vessel--intriguingly, but never ham-handedly, a Middle Eastern woman, whose interesting backstory brings up a lot of ethical questions.  Character dialogue can be skipped but is worth reading.  Even the weapons, the various Daemons, and the resources they drop have their own little bits of lore, which is a really nice effort despite the weapon designs lacking creativity.  All these bits of story do a good job of explaining concepts other genre entries might take for granted: why are there Daemons, and why do you in particular want to fight them?  How does gameplay death work if you're an angel?  How do experience points work?  Some of the Daemons, however, look like they came out of Dead Space and were then run through a grayscale filter--some more color and design variety would have been nice.  The ending gives you two choices but doesn't really explain much afterward, even if I still had fun overall.<br><br>Many enemies also have icons over their heads representing their abilities, but the game doesn't extensively explain those unless you look them up in the main-menu manual; the ones that really matter, however, will probably become obvious during gameplay.  The procedurally generated level designs function well (except for the one time a mandatory enemy spawned inside of a wall, forcing me to exit my Survival run) but don't always have a lot of 'art' to them.  Graphically there's not as much style as something like Transistor or Mark of the Ninja, but the setting concept is thoughtful and interesting.  The soundtrack, which reminds me of a mix of Frozen Synapse and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, is a lot better.  On smaller notes, some of the platform supports can be jumped through while others cannot (not sure why), and the &quot;Motes&quot; you gather sometimes look a bit too similar to the light fixtures.<br><br>The single biggest reason to play the game, besides its defense mechanism, is its difficulty, numerically represented in a corner of your screen.  This adapts to your playing skill and singlehandedly keeps the game fun: the early levels might seem too easy while the game calibrates, but that won't last.  You can also choose starting difficulty from a few options.  The main story may only take about four hours, but the last boss fight was INSANE even compared to the rest of the game (14 Nov EDIT: This difficulty got nerfed shortly after the game's launch but is still formidable) and took me yet another four hours' worth of attempts, with the difficulty never decreasing all the while.  I'm not complaining--it was amusing and even somewhat welcome to see a game so utterly unapologetic about its challenge, and I most certainly never got bored.  However, (this will hopefully be fixed) that last fight could use better optimization, since the bullet spam repeatedly slowed down my framerate--devastating in a high-speed game like this--and caused one of my two crashes.  There's also a funny but minor glitch where Seraph's graphic got stuck in a prone position but otherwise played fine.  A controller is highly recommended, as the keyboard technically works but makes directional evades a bit of a pain.  Most actions can be rebound, except for pausing and (on a controller) movement and enemy focusing, though the left and right stick functions can be swapped.<br><br>You also have daily and survival challenges you can do, complete with leaderboards, and some select rewards from these challenges carry over to the main game.

This review is coming from someone who bought the game during it's Early Access and playing the now finished version<br><br>Whats goood about it?<br><br><b>Artstyle<\/b> - Very vibrant colors and nice visual effects that can really immerse ya into the gameplay<br><br><b>The Adaptive difficulty<\/b> - Is a pretty cool feature. When im in my zone, I can kill everything in sight and the difficult ramps up which also rewards better stuff. If im not playing so great, the difficulty scales down and I wont be punished as much by the swarm of enemies.<br><br><b>Auto aiming<\/b> - Is a total first for me to love auto aiming in a game, even the ones with 'assisted aim' i always disable this. This gives me more focus on the acrobatics and platforming<br><br><b>Gun Fu Acrobatics<\/b> - It feels like a 2D Bayonetta at times. The movement and animations are very good. Lots of acrobatic moves while shooting stuffs<br><br><b>Level Tilesets<\/b> - This adds even more replayabilty to the game because even if you have to replay the first level\/mission, the tileset will be different from the previous run, making things a little bit more unpredictable<br><br><b>Crafting \/ Loot\/Weapon\/Item Pickups<\/b> - Is another cool feature that I wasn't expecting. Is possible to craft new weapons, miracles and other things that grant certain passive skills. Another big Plus in my book<br><br><b>Daily\/Weekly challenges<\/b> - These can really help with getting relics\/loot and adding even more replayability to the game. There aren't that many different challenges at the moment, maybe 4 or 5 different ones for Daily and the same for Weekly I think? However the random tilesets again adds more replayability<br><br>Whats Icky about it?<br><br>Hmm, to be honest the only thing that bothered me about this game was that the main character, Seraph HAS NO SHOESS!!<br>-Thankfully the dev has addressed this critical issue as we all know, every butt kicking angel deserves to be wearing some  awesome heels or boots (= <br><br>On a serious note, the only negative thingy I can find about this game is that sometimes the level design can be a tad confusing at times while moving throughout. <br><br>If ya are looking for a fun 2D shooter with uber replayabilty, then give this title a go for suree. <br><br>Do I recommend it? <br><br>Yap Yap<br><br><b>9.5\/10<\/b> (=\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25620739', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25620739' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25620739\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25620739' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25620739\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25620739', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25620739_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25620739_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28314217\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stray_pengo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"158338919\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab8299af1dd601dff8ca84af2cc3b7b182eb25d9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab8299af1dd601dff8ca84af2cc3b7b182eb25d9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab8299af1dd601dff8ca84af2cc3b7b182eb25d9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stray_pengo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"158338919\">stray_pengo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stray_pengo\/games\/?tab=all\">1,325 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stray_pengo\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stray_pengo\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">199.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSeraph is a run-and-gun platformer with procedurally-generated levels and adaptive difficulty.<br><br>The unique auto-aiming feature puts the main focus on fast-paced platforming which is fun - up to a point.  Random levels are there to break the monotony (if not much else,) and trite story is revealed through dialogs (without voices) and mission logs scattered around in the lockers.  They adequately hold your interest for ~10 hours through the main story mode.<br><br>There are weapons, passives, and special abilities to unlock\/buff, so when the going gets tough, you can go back and grind the daily\/weekly challenges for item giveaways or even restart the story mode as the perks are shared across the board.<br><br>After that, you can see how far the difficulty can be pushed.  The number is conveniently posted on the HUD, and there is a discrete satisfying sense of progression that &quot;now I can take difficulty n+1 with the new buff.&quot;  Higher difficulty means better loot which leads to more buff and higher rankings - there's a positive grind loop.  If you are so inclined, there is a MMO-like prestige system (5 &quot;rebirths&quot;) with slight permanent stat buffs to go for.<br><br>Unfortunately the difficulty doesn't scale very well.  Enemies don't get smarter; they just become faster, OP'ed, and spongy.  Even if your reflex is fast enough, the game makes sure it won't stay that way by speeding up everything and swarming you.  It's a lazy self-defeating design which encourages HP\/DPS grinding rather than the skill-based play it purports to promote.<br><br>The game starts to fall apart under such cheese, eventually to expose its core problem: the lack of tactical options.  You can't play scout\/stealth (poor visibility + dumb enemy AI,) there's no positional advantage (no headshot\/backshot) nor crowd control ability, loadouts don't make much difference, passives are mostly HP\/DPS tweaks.  As the sales pitch goes, it's literally &quot;evade or die.&quot;<br><br>In fact, among all the actions lingers a hollow feeling of dissociation.  The environment is completely static.  Enemies don't react; they are obvious automatons programmed to run\/hover\/warp to your location then spam their attacks.  You can't affect their motions; they won't even bother to flinch when shotgun is fired in their face, then dissolve into nothingness with a puff of smoke when defeated.  Seraph dances for a strangely transparent and distant audience.<br><br>On the technical side, this is a poorly optimized Unity game which is way more resource-demanding than should be.  If your rig is not up to scratch you'll suffer low FPS as well as desynced inputs - missed jumps, unintended double jumps, all those ugliness.  (It seems to be the latest &quot;Unity thing;&quot; I'm suffering from this with Oxenfree as well.)  Be warned.<br><br>TL;DR: Seraph may have fallen short of its aspiration, yet it does offer an unique mix of procedural platforming and MMO-like grinding.  It can make a good timesink if and only if the solid core mechanic by itself can be a motivation enough for you to play on.  For an engrossing story, interesting skill tree or elaborate level design, I'd look elsewhere.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28314217', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28314217' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28314217\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28314217' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28314217\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28314217', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28314217_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28314217_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22654410\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">Hobbes<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/games\/?tab=all\">3,565 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/\">95 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>Disclaimer, this review is for an EARLY ACCESS product, this means the review should be deemed provisional, and will change as the game evolves over time.

When you ramp up the incoming fire to near bullet hell levels of difficulty!<\/div><br>Seraph, from the developers of Ironcast, a rather interesting game in its' own right, is in essence a side on shooter where you play an acrobatic angelic\/human host, bound up in a prison explicitly designed to hold said angel, for reasons unknown, and at the start of the game, your prison is opened. The guards are well, they're not doing so good, you collect a pair of pistols from the ground, and set off to find answers.<br><br>As an angel in a human host, you have access to miracles, most key of which is the ability to despatch demonic invaders with a flash of your wings and a touch of your hand. This requires you to be in -close- proximity. Considering that everything in the local area wants you dead, and you've a limited time to make this happen, this can be rather dangerous. You also have your rather human tools to hand - guns, lots and lots of lovely guns. They come currently in two flavours, the default twin pistols, which can be aimed at two seperate targets, and primary weapons, which range from the straightforward (Autopistols, shotgun, submachine gun, AR) through to the nutty (Railgun... RAILGUN?).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Spend your bullets carefully, you don't have infinite numbers...<\/div><br>These primary weapons are categorically more powerful than your plink plink pistols, but they have limited ammo, and as a consequence you have to budget your use of these powerful primary weapons carefully, saving them for the much more powerful demons that can regenerate, and the multi stage demonic champions that require multiple smites in order to bring down.<br><br>This arsenal is all fine and well, but it doesn't touch on the signature element of Seraph's core gameplay, a &quot;smart targetting&quot; system that takes the hassle of finding enemies for you. Seraph will auto-lock the closest threat and direct her fury at them with whatever firearm you've selected whilst you focus on moving, using miracles, and generally not dying. The not dying is important, see, these enemies will throw a LOT of nasty attacks your way, and as the difficulty ramps up, the attacks not only increase in damage output, they'll also increase in variety. <br><br>Enemies gain -new- tricks as your difficulty dynamically cranks up, matching your skill as you go. Finding things too easy? As you mill the enemies, you'll see the difficulty counter in the bottom counter begin to race upwards, and before you know it, your opponents will have new toys to play with, will hit harder, and need more ammo to bring down. The reward however is more components, and more experience.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">An early taste of the angelic offerings<\/div><br>Currently the game only offers a subset of the possible blessings, oaths and miracles that will be in the full version, we've a lot more to look forward to, but the moment to moment gameplay is absolutely excellent, providing a good cross between spectacle shooter and bullet hell where your management of the blink resource and your positioning proves more vital than targetting and dealing damage. This is a game that rewards good placement and evading your foes, before surging forward to deliver lethal strikes in a real hurry. You need to be fast, elegant and acrobatic.<br><br>Graphically, for a two dimensional game it is highly reminiscent of ACE's Abyss Odyssey, but with a very futuristic touch, and a matching soundtrack to boot. The soundtrack having a very electro-industrial feel puts you in mind of things like Equilibrium and the Matrix, which is very fitting given the gunplay involved.<br><br>There's also suggestions and bug fixes being worked through by the developers, and more good things will hopefully be on the way.<br><br>At this point my final judgment is -<br><br>Verdict : <b>Highly recommended<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22654410', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22654410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22654410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22654410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22654410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22654410', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22654410_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22654410_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30913844\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shattered_steel\/recommended\/425670\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"36113935\">$hattered_$teel<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 19.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGood platformer.

Animations are fluid and dynamic, with a lot of inspiration from &quot;Equilibrium&quot; for movement and shooting. Solid controls and I appreciate the auto-aiming mechanic that lets me concentrate on dodging and platforming. The character does tend to be very &quot;grabby&quot; on walls resulting in inadvertant ledge-grabs or wall climbs that can slow you down, and I've never really gotten &quot;lock on&quot; to do what I want so I generally just let the game's aiming handle it, but that works well enough anyway. (Steam controller, so it could be that the right touchpad is a little wonky for it compared to a right analog stick on something like a 360 controller.) <br><br>It took me a while to really understand how the various power-ups work and interact, so I'd definitely recommend poking around the community area for a write-up if you're looking to really get into it.<br><br>I LOVE the scaling difficulty system. Brilliant bit of design.<br><br>I do wish levels had a minimap. The objective arrows help get through the game but if hunting through a level for something they don't highlight (for example, I found a door-opening console but died before I could get through the security door and want to get back to the console to try again) the somewhat undifferentiated level backgrounds and room layouts can make it difficult to find my way back.<br><br>But that's a pretty minor quibble on an overable very enjoyable game.

It\u2019s a pretty straightforward game to get into, but there\u2019s a fair amount of variation and weapons to pick from. Every few levels the setting changes, so that the scenery doesn\u2019t get too monotonous. The game has various modes, with Twitch viewers allowed to interfere if you allow them and speedruns encouraged; it\u2019s entirely possible to turn off dialogue and just focus on the action.<br><br>There\u2019s not really much to the story. There\u2019s brief talking head moments at the start and end of certain levels and ship logs that give insight to what happened on the ship that you\u2019re on. To be fair, the focus is more on the gunplay than story. It\u2019s not terribly difficult to guess where it\u2019s going.<br><br>The gameplay is fantastic for what it is. I played it a fair amount over the past few weeks. There\u2019s a pretige \/ level system that allows you to reset your progress in exchange for permanent upgrades that carry through. There\u2019s a variety of active and passive abilities, with crystals giving the Seraph little perks and active \u201cmiracles\u201d that give you two abilities that can vary from setting up a damaging wall of light to throwing an orb that passes through all enemies, doing more damage on the way back. There\u2019s a crafting system that allows you to upgrade or add weapons, accessories and miracles that can be used. In addition to this, the Seraph levels, allowing certain perks that can multiply your chosen skills. The difficulty autosets itself, depending on how poorly or how well you\u2019re doing.

This game truly is one of the rare gems out there and has captivated me from the start. You play as an angel who fights her way out of prison, destroying demons with firearms and angelic powers while jumping around at the speed of lightning. It honestly can\u2019t get much better than that! <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Effective movement is key to become good at this game, and it\u2019s your only true job! Since the game aims in your place the moment you get close enough to an enemy, all you have to do is finding that perfect angle and pulling the trigger. Dodge incoming projectiles and hungry demons by utilizing your environment to the maximum of your ability. It\u2019s definitely challenging to bypass foes with slick and smooth moves, and it gets more and more difficult as you progress through the main story.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div>Rapid combat requires high-quality graphics to create an excellent gaming experience, and the developers have managed that perfectly. Nothing too spectacular, but you won\u2019t be staring at your surroundings or idling through cleared levels anyway.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Game modes<\/div>Apart from the main story, you get two additional modes where you can compete against other players in an attempt to achieve the highest ranking. Every day starts with a new challenge that gives you the opportunity to test your skills, as there\u2019s always a specific perfection multiplier that grants you extra points based on how well you performed. The other mode is based on survival, takes quite a bit longer to complete and its leaderboard refreshes every week.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Character progression<\/div>Performance is not the only thing that helps you grow in this game. As you clear the available levels of the main story and participate in the ranked modes, you collect shards and other essences that you can use to improve the power and efficiency of your angel. From crafting better weapons to upgrading your celestial abilities, you name it! There\u2019s also the possibility to gain a permanent increase in strength through rebirth, which you can unlock five times in total. Do note that you lose any other progress you\u2019ve made beforehand, so you\u2019ll have to start over from scratch once you gain a permanent bonus.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall verdict<\/div>Honestly, it never gets boring. Once I committed myself to playing this game, I was hooked for hours of fun. If you enjoy swift combat with guns, I\u2019d definitely recommend to try it out. You get quite a lot for a relatively low price and having wings never goes out of style!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29885474', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29885474' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29885474\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29885474' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29885474\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29885474', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29885474_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29885474_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/425670\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 312 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30363059","30355422","30751663","30778819","25614111","25701201","25662004","25620739","28314217","22654410"]}
