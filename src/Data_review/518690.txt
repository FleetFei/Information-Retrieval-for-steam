So far, it's been 100% rock solid, with only a couple of irritations that are quite easily dealt with;<br><br>* Some software, especially Nvidia drivers, don't play nice with SKPC and requires to be turned off before reinstalling.<br>* It can be frustrating to accidentally block something that is called via rundll.exe, as SKPC will block EVERYTHING that uses it - and as I couldn't find a way to unblock it (the usual methods didn't seem to work), on the advice of the tuys at SK, I had to remove SKPC, reboot, and reinstall.  <br><br>Currently, I have not tried the Gaming Accelerator, as my current system has no need for extra FPS.  I purchased this solely for the security system.  Judging by other reviews, I would suggest if you have a mid-range PC, you will very likely benefit from it.  <br><br>Negatives?  None really, I think I would prefer a nicer, more professional looking UI, the huge black and orange window does the software itself an injustice.  I would much prefer a smaller, cleaner interface without the orange.  It is professional software... make it look like it!<br><br>That's about it.  I personally recommend allowing SKPC to act as UAC, this just stops extra clicks and so far is working very well.  Recommended for those who start with a fresh Windows installation, are comfortable with basic Windows file systems, and understand this is not an active scanner, but a passive guardian.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30500521', 'summary' );

It's a replacement for an antivirus and (probably) doesn't work with one installed. An antivirus scans the filesystem, deletes suspicious files and prevents them from being executed. Many files need to be scanned and the application that is requesting those files is slowed down.<br><br>What PC Security does instead is keep a list of applications. (All applications installed before PC Security will automatically be added to this list and trusted.) Any application being started that is not in this list will be caught and PC Security will display a list of options how the application should be handled.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Yes&quot; gives the application access to change the system.<br><\/li><li>&quot;No&quot; prevents the application from being launched and blocks any further attempts to launch it.<br><\/li><li>&quot;Limited Access&quot; sandboxes the application and prevents it from making changes to your system.<\/li><\/ul>If you were to download a virus then running it in &quot;Limited Access&quot; mode would prevent that virus from harming your system. An application is only checked once when it starts and is not slowed down once it is running. Reducing stress on your drive and CPU.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5u6Fvjy.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5u6Fvjy.png<\/a><br><br><b>Run all new applications in &quot;Limited Access&quot; mode first to prevent getting infected with a virus anyway.<\/b><br><br>It is also customizable what types of files should be caught before they are launched.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y32nq7n.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y32nq7n.png<\/a><br><br>All of this works almost perfectly. There are a few applications that require PC Security to be disabled when first installing them. Microsoft Office is one example. Almost every application functions normally with it enabled. Two applications I came across that didn't work correctly were the &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; dialog not popping up and WinRAR being unable to extract files directly from the right click menu. Opening the archive and extracting from there works fine.<br><br>I also tested the unsupported usecase of installing an antivirus alongside PC Security. Temporarily disabling PC Security before installing allowed it to install correctly and function normally. This was tested with Avira Free Antivirus and AVG Free Antivirus. Both installed via Ninite. Your mileage may vary. I suggest against doing this since it adds negligible extra security and can potentially cause serious issues. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gaming Accelerator 2<\/div><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XiI3M9n.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XiI3M9n.png<\/a><br><br>Enabling Gaming Accelerator reboots the computer with all startup applications disabled by default. You can select which applications you do need on startup. Selecting an application to load with Windows starts it without having to reboot and will remember your choice. Additionally, Gaming Accelerator temporarily disables background services to provide a boost even without any startup applications. This also disables PC Security to prevent any issues while running your game.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/L3h6TjZ.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/L3h6TjZ.png<\/a><br><br>Restarting and enabling Gaming Accelerator might take a while. If you have an SSD and Fast Boot\/Fast Startup enabled this shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>Gaming Accelerator does actually provide a boost to FPS unlike many other &quot;accelerators&quot; and &quot;boosters&quot;. You'll also experience less FPS drops due to there being no background applications. Requiring a reboot makes this incredibly hard to record in action and prove any numbers. This review will be updated with footage and benchmarks once I have a way to record them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Recommendations<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I recommend the average user to stick with their antivirus. The security is good enough and you can assume everything just works.<br><\/li><li>I recommend Gaming Accelerator for anyone that wants extra performance or just has too much applications starting with Windows. If you are not interested in the PC Security part of this application then buying just Gaming Accelerator 2 might be a cheaper option for you: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/520840\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/520840\/<\/a> .<br><\/li><li>I recommend PC Security for the user that wants more security and knows how applications work and interract with the registry, user data, the rest of the file system and each other and doesn't mind troubleshooting when something doesn't work quite right.<br><\/li><li>For anyone that is the option above, doesn't mind breaking their installation of Windows and wants maximum security. You could look into setting up an antivirus alongside PC Security as a failsafe. This adds negligible extra security, can potentially cause serious issues and is probably not worth the effort. You also won't get any performance improvements from PC Security and is not supported by Seventh Knight and might break at anytime.

Honestly I was interested in what the company claimed to offer, and read through Alot of the discussions about it.  I did my homework and sold myself on the product, and it was a hard sell to be honest as the $60 asking price was alot more than I was looking to spend at the time I was browsing new releases.<br>So Is it worth it?  Does it work?<br>In a nutshell yes, and hence the thumbs up Im giving it.  But there are some heads up, disclaimers, caveats, what have you with those answers.  As its a 2 for 1 package deal let me try to cover them both individualy and jointly.  Jointly, the programs are a very easy install.  Just like anything else here on steam, Just down load and run, and follow the promts.  This worked really well for me until I got to the part where I had to restart to complete the installation.  Wouldn't you know it there was a Windows Update hiding in the background, that decided to install itself in the middle of the restart.  Had me sweatting nails to be sure.  So I highly recomend restarting your computer before you even attempt to install the programs to make sure the same thing doesnt happen to you.  When the computer did finally restart I noticed right away that it was acting differently.  It took an extra 3-5 seconds after making it to the desktop before it threw an error and then loaded up the 7th Knight interface.  I emailed them about the error code i was receiving and have yet to hear back from them.  To be fair I emailed them late on Friday night, and now its the weekend, so Maybe by Monday Ill hear back from them.  I am only slightly dissapointed that i didnt hear back sooner after all the hype I read about customer service and helpfulness.  Anyway closing the error window made it go away and I have yet to discern any actual problems caused by what ever the error message was complaining about.  Also as I pointed out earlier Windows Update jumped in the middle of things and for all I know the update itself, or the bad timing of it caused the error in question.<br>Individualy now, first the &quot;anti-virus&quot; program.  Truthfully it is not antivirus program at all.  It is both better in some ways and all together unrelated to anything resembling an antivirus program.  It works by not allowing any program to run on your computer without you explicitily allowing said program to run (All the programs you have installed before installing this are considered safe by the program unless you specificaly tell it otherwise, and all other programs that attempt to run after installation that were not initially cleared promt the program to ask You to decide if its safe to run them..)  This will keep you safe from viruses as long as You pay attention to what you are doing on your computer.  Opening an email and all of a sudden a new program wants to run? Hello Virus.  This will not protect you at all if you are installing programs you think are safe, but in truth are not.  Downloading and using a Mod with a self installing exec that actually contains some kind of hidden nastiness.  You give it permission to run, and this does nothing to save you from said nasty surprise.<br>On to the Game Accelerator, yes it works too!  I easily picked up 5-10 FPS on FO4 depending on where I was in the game, and I was also able to set the speed to max on Rimworld and scroll the screen without stuttering \/ blurring on a ludicrous map size.  That said I opened up Task Master and still saw a couple of things I usually manually end process on when Im going to be hard core gaming and was surprised to see 7th Knight had not disabled them.  Things like Bonjor service, Mobile Device Service, etc.  Also for whatever reason, gaming mode does not turn off Windows Defender on Windows 10 but DOES turn off 7th Knight Security ???  So when I use it, I of course pull up Defender, turn it off temporarily and turn 7th Knight Security back on.  Turning off Defender while your gaming is a garunteed boost in performace, and 7th Knight should have zero impact on your gaming as it doesnt do ANYTHING unless an unauthorized program tries to run.<br>Final verdict, I feel the program(s) still needs some adjustments to make it a bit more reliable and Id strongly recomend a users \/ tip guide be included with the download and on their website.  Whole lot of typing there, hope its useful to anyone on the fence.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25818540', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25818540' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25818540\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25818540' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25818540\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25818540', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25818540_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25818540_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28266189\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paulmoffat\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"90592053\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94b40cef66e87a4927b0495cf3135482ed201c82.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94b40cef66e87a4927b0495cf3135482ed201c82.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94b40cef66e87a4927b0495cf3135482ed201c82_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paulmoffat\/\" data-miniprofile=\"90592053\">Dablin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paulmoffat\/games\/?tab=all\">351 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paulmoffat\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/paulmoffat\/recommended\/518690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI generally try to avoid security based applications such as Virus Scanners and Firewalls. Not because I don't believe in them in principle; a secure computer system is always a preferred ideal.<br><br>Through experience though I found most to be unreliable, expensive and in some respects outright deceptive and malicious. I tend to keep my own computer safe through common sense and caution which for the most part has helped keep my computer virus and trojan free... for the most part.<br><br>I came across Seventh Knight PC Security not by any attempt on my part to seek a security based application but honestly as just a bundled accessory that came with Gaming Accelerator 2. I wasn't really that interested in Seventh Knight in itself but the discount for both of them at the time was very appealing so I accepted it way.<br><br>I didn't place much stock in it, I didn't expect it to work 100% of the time, and I wasn't really going to put myself in situation to truely test it. But I was curious for some reason so I installed it anyway. And there it has been, running, scanning, monitoring... for the most part siliently in the background since that day I first started it. To be honest, I had tend to forget that it is even there the majority of the time.<br><br>I am though periodically reminded of its presence when I try to install some new application or game, it intervenes as intended as a safety barrier between new software trying to just run themselves unexpectingly - much like Windows built in UAC. I have had a couple of instances where I've had to disable the security system to allow some installer to run without error. But that isn't unexpected, there is actually an option right there in the given dialog to do that very thing for that very purpose. The Seventh Knight designers obviously had enough forsight to forsee that.<br><br>I'm going to be straight up and say, though I can't speak 100% of Seventh Knight, I do now feel alot more confident of my computers security with it there and for the most part I haven't realised any performance issues or unwarranted disturbances by it while its been on my PC.<br><br>The great irony about all of this, is I bought Seventh Knight to get Gaming Accelerator 2. I've used GA2 only a handful of times and have practically abandoned it. I did realise some small performance increases in some games while I used GA2 but nothing worth the time and effort of a full reboot of the system to achieve it<br><br>I'm content and very satisfied with Seventh Knight at this point. I have no qualms about it being on my PC and it hasn't done anything to make me question it or feel the need to remove it (ie. performance issues etc). Actually quite the opposite. If your looking for a security package seriously consider this application - atleast research it. I can't speak for other solutions that are available, I tended to avoid them out of habit, driven through bad experiences in the past. But I can say for the most part SK does what it says it does - and at the very least it gives you a catch point for any unauthorised application trying to run. If you don't trust something you can prevent it starting right then and there.<br><br>Security is an important concept in computing so I recommend you do your research and decide for yourself what will work for you. There are many applications available and I personally consider SK to be an honourable candidate for that role in an otherwise satuated and at times deceptive security based software market.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28266189', 'summary' );

IT CANNOT CLEAN AN ALREADY INFECTED SYSTEM AT ALL. HOW IT WORKS IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT. GET OVER IT. <\/b> <br><br>Now that we got that out of the way, I can explain what does this software do. Think of a smartphone. Something that runs IOS or Android. Remember how you use it. You can install applications, take pictures, add contacts, browse the internet, yet you almost never get infected. Your data almost never falls into wrong hands. You are usually totally safe. And they achieve this by the sandbox system they utilize. An application you run cannot run outside that little sandbox, it is given its own private playroom, and you can choose, to some extent, which toys(contacts, camera, loaction and stuff) are in that sandbox, or how big it is.<br> <br>Now think about Windows, there is no sandbox. No playrooms for the apps. The whole house is available to the app for it to run amok. It can even burn the whole house down or just steal the stuff in the house and go make money off of it. Now, imagine you hired a guard. It constantly patrols the house and inspect everything in the house, including the apps themselves to find such apps that can harm the house. That's how an antivirus works. Now imagine you bought high security doors which can't be lockpicked, destroyed or simply otherwise opened without a key. They completely confine the the place an app runs in, essentially making it run in a sandbox. You have all the keys and if you wish, you can open some(or all) the doors, in addition to deciding what is in the playroom(sandbox). That is PC Security. What does it do is to confine the apps into such spaces so that they never can do anything, I repeat, ANYTHING without your permission.<br><br>At the time you install it, it scans your software, so it can see what is on the system. Then it assumes whatever it found to be trustworthy. After that, every new executable you launch opens a pop up about how you should launch them. You can launch them in a small sandbox mode where they can't access pretty much anything, in a bigger sandbox mode where they have limited access to your contacts and settings. If you want to install new software though, you'll need to temporarily turn it off from the promt window it opened, allowing you to open all the doors for a while(don't do this unless you absolutely trust the software you're going to install). You can also prevent it from running at all. It gives you the sandbox feature similar to the ones being used in IOS and Android, with the option to actually stop the sandbox for a while necessary for things like installations. Nothing can run on the Windows without your consent and nothing on your computer can reach your sensitive data without your consent. Ever.<br><br>On the other hand though I must add that in IOS or Android, you never get the keys to the sandbox rooms, unless you root(Android) or jailbreak(iPhone) your phone. This is, actually a security improvement because it prevents the user from installing apps from outside of trusted sources. Be careful with which application you're going to use, especially when it requires to be outside of sandbox mode to run properly because if you, yourself let a malicious app out of its sandbox, it's going to harm your computer anyway as you have defeated the purpose of the application itself.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gaming Accelerator 2<\/div> <br>Once again, I'll have to start with a disclaimer, so here it is.<br><br><b> This is NOT A SYSTEM OPTIMIZER. IT DOESN'T MODIFY ANY SYSTEM FILES,  REGISTRY SETTINGS OR ANYTHING ELSE ON ANY WAY. IT WILL NOT MESS YOUR COMPUTER UP JUST TO FAIL TRYING TO ACCELERATE YOUR GAMES. THIS SOFTWARE'S PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON YOUR COMPUTER'S HARDWARE AND HOW BLOATED IT IS. IT MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON COMPUTERS WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE HARDWARE AND MINIMAL BLOATWARE, BUT IN THE OPPOSITE SITUATIONS, IT CAN WORK A LOT BETTER.<\/b><br><br>Well this software is a weird one. And by weird I mean really weird. It claims to accelerate games but doesn't seem to do anything to the PC at first glance. But it actually does, you just have to turn it on, and restart your pc with the prompt that appears.Then when Windows boots again, GA2 will block the stuff that start with Windows, including Windows's own software. That way it prevents your resources from being used by various machine-hogging applications, thus, giving you a much smoother gaming experience. It, albeit usually small, also can boost your fps,  depending on your rig and what it blocks but this is not the point of the application. The strength of this application is getting rid of(or at least greatly reducing) all that hiccups and stutters that annoy you so much. Even if fps is as low as 20(in GTA V).<br>To do this, it uses the same basic code PC Security uses to confine applications into sandboxes(remember that it can actually prevent apps from launching at all), but instead of sandboxing them, it disables them entirely. And the result is, bloatwares and unnecessary Windows components(unnecessary for gaming, that is) don't launch. Much smoother gaming experience.<br><br>Also, it actually has two modes, one that kills some of these unnecessary things while still giving you some Windows funtionality, and the other, called Max Boost, kills that functionality as well to provide even faster and smoother game experience so if normal gaming mode is not enough for you, you can try to maximize your performance with this. To end the gaming mode, you simply need to restart your computer again and it willl turn on as it normally does.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> To wrap it up:<\/div> The PC Security software brings the functionality of a sandboxed environment we know in smartphones to keep your pc secure and  the Gaming Accelerator 2 uses this sandbox functionality to keep windows and bloatware out of your gaming experience by disabling them, making your game look and feel much smoother, and a little bit faster. In my opinion, it's well worth the money you spend for it, maybe even more. But since PC Security eventually places everything in YOUR hands, if you make a mistake, and insist on it despite everything PC Security does to keep it away, you'll surely get infected. But if you know what you're doing, this is the PERFECT tool to keep your computer secure. Also the restarting requirement to enable\/disable Gaming Mode might be a little pain. But it's still well worth it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Final Notes: <\/div><ol><li>Due to how Steam DRM works, this product does NOT use Steam DRM, and the only thing you get for buying it is the installer and an automatically generated, fully working, activation key that never expires.

The bonus of the game accelerator software encouraged me to get it.<br><br><u><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pro:<\/div><\/u><br>I've been using this for 5 weeks now. So far this works well, At the end of every week I run two virus scans with Malwarebytes and malicious software removal tool just to verify that nothing made it past. It always reports clean. <br>The product basically acts as a sentry, if something foreign tries to execute on your system, the software will ask if you want to allow it. You can even sandbox the application your installing by selecting an option called 'limited access' to install it temporaily in a secure sandbox. This is a fantastic option in case your unsure about the application your installing. Viruses can't get out of a sandbox. You can add a password to the security prompt that appears when installing an application for added security. I found this especially useful because my less tech savy spouse would blindly click yes to popups on the pc with out reading first. <br>And the final Pro is the Lifetime Licence, enough said.<br><br><u><div class=\"bb_h1\">Neutral:<\/div><\/u><br><b>PC Security:<\/b> <br>When I first installed it, I did have a bit of an issue with the software always prompting me to activate whenever I restarted my pc. But Seventh Knight have a great customer support team and were very helpful in getting the software updated and working properly.<br>There is an option in the advanced menu (&quot;Assign Install rights&quot;) that you can turn on that will cause the software to ignore security protocols and allow the next program to be installed. Once installed the security protocols will turn back on. This can potentially be dangerous. Even though the software does explain what it will do with a yes\/no prompt, I think Seventh Knight should also explain the potential danger inherent in turning on this option.<br><br><b>The Gaming Accelerator:<\/b> will analyse your system and then prompt you to restart you PC. It will then boot up with windows running in a very trimmed down state (no bulk) improving your system resources. You should be aware that the PC security software will also get turned off by the accelerator. No problem though just turn it back on and your safe again.<br><br><u><div class=\"bb_h1\">Neg:<\/div><\/u> <br>If you use Tor Browser, it's completely incompatible and will not run unless you turn the PC Security off. <br><br><b>Note:<\/b> <br>Malwarebytes will report a false positive <i>Broken.OpenCommand<\/i> on the PC Security App. Just ignore it, otherwise you'll cripple the security software.<br><br>Overall I'm happy with the purchase<br><br>update Dec5: Had my first maleware attack today and PC Security did it's Job perfectly.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26550335', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26550335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26550335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26550335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26550335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26550335', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26550335_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26550335_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26746214\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"91992755\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/\" data-miniprofile=\"91992755\">FastJack<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/games\/?tab=all\">653 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/recommended\/518690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Seventh Knight PC Security + Gaming Accelerator 2-<br><br>I have been a PC gamer for so long I have learned the hard ways about how Ativirus software works! Most of them are very costly and install a buch of crap that you really do not need, they can also be bad for the gamers as they are resourse hogs!<br><br>Well not to long ago I came accross this one and knew exactly what it would be, I know it because these guys designed <br>the software for millitary grade quality. Now this version is scalled down for the home\/personal use! The best part of it is the security, it functions in a way that does not bug the user all the time with constant scans, instead it takes a snap shot of everything you have installed on your PC during install, and thats how it protects, so for example you download a new program online and it wants to make changes to your PC Seventh Knight will stop it and prompt you wheather it is safe or not! <br><br>To me it is the best on the market right now, no anual renewals, no scanning \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and the game accelerator is just what us gamers want, it works just as they claim it does, I have tested it so many times just to be sure and I can say it is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Awesome! Like I said earlier I am an older gamer so I have learned to see through all the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t software out there that claims to work magic...

However, it's not a scanner - it does not search your computer for existing malware. What it actually does is it prevents new software or files from being able to harm your computer unless you specifically allow it access. For example, you accidentally download &quot;totallynotavirus.exe&quot;. With any other security program, it may scan this file and match it to a database of malware. But if this specific malware isn't in the database, it's going to declare the file clean. On the other hand, Seventh Knight will see the new file and ask if you want to put it on the whitelist. The nice thing here is that most programs don't need to be whitelisted to run properly - non-whitelisted programs will still run, but they won't be able to do any harm to your computer because Seventh Knight will run it inside a sandbox. This means that Seventh Knight can actually protect you against Malware that we don't even know about yet. This also means that if you already know a specific file is safe, you don't need to worry about the false positives most anti-virus software will throw against clean files.   <br><br>Note that Seventh Knight assumes your computer is clean upon install, and thus will place everything already installed on your PC in the whitelist. <br><br>However, something I don't like about Seventh Knight is the rather clunky UI. First, there is no way to see everything you've whitelisted on... well... a list. While Seventh Knight does store that information somewhere, it keeps it well hidden, and there actually is no way to know if something on your PC is whitelisted or not. If you want to change the status of an existing program, you have to click &quot;reset a program&quot; and then launch that exact program - which will cause the Seventh Knight to ask if you want to whitelist it as if it were a new program. This is rather awkward and I hope they improve this in later versions.<br> <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Do you need Seventh Knight PC Security?<\/div> Seventh Knight does actually give you extra security that free products (or even other paid products!) cannot give against malware so new that it's not in any anti-virus databases.  It also grants you the ability to use potentially harmful software in the sandbox rather than simply bypassing it. But Windows Defender actually does a good enough job against more malware at keeping your computer safe, and there are lots of free products out there if Windows Defender isn't enough. True, they can't protect against as of yet unknown malware, but that extra security benefit wouldn't be worth paying for if that was all Seventh Knight did.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">So then, why are you recommending this software?<\/div> Simple - Seventh Knight only needs to run when you open new software for the first time. It doesn't have any kind of scanner, and that includes real-time scanning. This is important because real-time scanners scan every file you're working with, constantly to see if they are in the malware database. This means that your computer is using a lot more processing power to work with these files than it really should.<br><br>With Seventh Knight protecting the computer, you don't need real-time scanning. You can get rid of all real-time scanning on your computer <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/3569-windows-defender-real-time-protection-turn-off-windows-10-a.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" > including that of Windows Defender<\/a> and still be safe. Ultimately, the reason to get Seventh Knight is not the extra security, but for the resources you'll save by replacing real-time scanning. Well, than and the fact that you don't need to buy it again next year, and the year after that...<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Hey, what's Gaming Accelerator 2<\/div>Gaming Accelerator has a rather misleading name. Not that it doesn't accelerate games, but in the fact that unlike similarly named products, it actually works.<br><br>Most similar-named software are actually optimizers, meaning they change windows settings or mess with the registry or  otherwise mess around in your computer in an attempt to make your computer and\/or games run faster. It's possible that some of the changes they do may cause an improvement, but they don't do anything you can't just change yourself. They also tend to make changes that you may not want, such as disabling services you actually use (If one more program tries to turn off Superfetch...) or in the worst cases actually cause more problems than they solve.<br><br>Gaming Accelerator doesn't do anything like that. It doesn't change a single setting. What it actually does is it reboots windows in &quot;Gaming Mode&quot;. This should prevent almost everything from running other than your games. You are supposed to be able to allow specific programs to load even in gaming mode, but Gaming accelerator has the same UI as it's sibling and it's awkward to use this feature.<br><br>Since almost nothing else will even load at all (not just at startup, I mean PERIOD!), the games will have far more resources available to them. You know how DX12 and Vulkan are trying to get the games to talk directly to the graphics card without drivers getting in the way? Gaming Accelerator tries to get the games to talk directly to your hardware without *WINDOWS* getting in the way. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">So, do the games actually run better?<\/div>If you're running a game on a PC that just barely meets the minimum requirements (or even falls short), than the difference in performance may very well be night and day! Granted, they likely wouldn't run perfectly, but they'd be much better than without this software. For example, my old peice of crap (TM) actually reached double digit FPS. <br><br>However, most of you reading this review aren't using the crappy PC I got at Walmart in 2011. You'll likely be using a machine with far more resources available and high-end GPUs that cost more than low end PCs. And truth is, the gains on a high-end machine are far less noticeable, at least in terms of maximum possible FPS. However, depending on the game you may see a decent increase in minimum FPS, meaning less stuttering or stalling.

Pardon for my bad English, the review will be updated when necessary.<br><br>- When I first saw this on Steam, I was like ah, another &quot;game booster&quot; *poker face*<br>- I then read the description... oooh sounds too good to be true<br>- Proceeds to the discussion page then became curious about what it does<br>- Tested it out, I was like (redacted) wtf??? with a mix of amazement because &quot;omg it really works!&quot;<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Testing the software<\/div><b>Pre-testing<\/b><br>To begin with, I'm going to test GTA V using its own benchmark on a recommended graphics setting by GeForce Experience (most of it are set to high without the MSAA and FXAA turned on) on a mid to high-end laptop with the following specs:<br><br>- Intel Core i7 3632QM &lt;-- this processor doesn't have enough clock speed it needs to run GTA V but it works fine <br>- 4GB DDR3 RAM<br>- NVIDIA GT645M 2GB<br>- 5200RPM hard drive<br><br>*I'm about to run this test on a 30c \/ 86f weather with no AC just so you know. #HowToDestroyYourPC101<br><br><b>Testing<\/b><br>Here's how I categorized them<br>- With Max preset on<br>- With Gaming mode preset on<br>- With Razer Cortex's game booster on<br>- None<br><br><b>Results<\/b><br>- Max preset on with 40-60FPS at less than 10 FPS drops<br>- Gaming mode preset on with about 30-45FPS at about 10 FPS drops<br>- RazerCortex's game booster on with 30-45FPS at more than 25 FPS drops<br>- None with 20-45FPS at about 25-30FPS drops<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Additional notes:<\/div>- My taskbar became unresponsive at some point then it goes back to normal then goes back to being unresponsive again when I was using the max preset the whole time. I ended up running GTA V via Task Manager but other than that, no software\/hardware problems or errors occurred.<br>- Setting some unnecessary services into low priority in task manager seemed to boost performance(the fps drops kinda decreased a little bit).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros and cons<\/div>- The software is pretty light, It doesn't affect the system especially while gaming.<br>- Gaming Accelerator really does its job reducing stutter and increases performance when gaming.<br>- No more costly anti-virus software renewals (like really, in my case).<br><br><b>Cons<\/b><br>- You have to restart every time you turn on or off gaming mode (but the good thing is, the boot time when on gaming mode is noticeably faster). For hard drive users, this could be annoying.<br>- For Stardock Fences users, you won't be able to see your desktop icons there as it is also disabled by the software, unless you restart Windows Explorer.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div>Seventh Knight PC Security is not an antivirus, it works a lot like a prevention software, filtering stuff by choosing whether to allow, deny, or give limited access to it at your own discretion before it makes a mess rather than the other way around.<br><br>Gaming Accelerator 2 is completely different, unlike other game boosters which they just disable the processes temporarily, fire up your game, then restore when you're done. It\u2019s not just enough. This software reboots and puts you into gaming mode which I prefer to call it Windows &quot;safe mode&quot; where you can play on it with all the necessities needed to run the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">TL;DR part<\/div><b>Do you recommend this software?<\/b><br>Yes, and it's better than any game booster on the market. PC Security is a nice piece of software and very effective <b>only<\/b> if you know what you are doing.

I seriously don't play ANY game without it. It boosts my system up %79 each time and I can seriously see the framerate increase in games. Game that I struggled to get a smooth gameplay are now smooth because of this great software. I have a triple monitor setup and you can't always get high graphics settings, but with this software working for you then you can. Now I have high graphics in games and smooth gameplay without a hitch. I use to get weird gameplay issues before having this and now I don't at all.<br><br>What this software does is eliminate all the background noise before starting up a game, It turns off almost everything to give you the best experience possible for you to play your games. <br><br>The only con I have with this software is that sometimes it doesn't give the %79 increase, it sometimes goes to %11 or %20 of an increase. The way I worked around this is by restarting the &quot;Gaming Mode&quot; and then it usually hits the number I want. <br><br>The security feature is nice and helps you to monitor what is being installed but I mainly use the Game Accelerator since that is so great! <br><br>Is this worth the money they are asking? Totally!!! I absolutely love it! I won't game anymore without it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26095888', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26095888' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26095888\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26095888' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26095888\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26095888', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26095888_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26095888_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/518690\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 21 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30500521","25829586","25818540","28266189","25771455","26550335","26746214","26640640","25830406","25885706"]}
