At one point, fans were given the chance to purchase a Mushihime-sama v1.5 PCB. The very next year, they received another opportunity to obtain the elusive v1.5, by buying a first-print edition of Mushihime HD for the Xbox 360. Today, gamers everywhere can acquire this rare exclusive for less than the cost of lunch. Is v1.5 really that big a deal? In my opinion, it most certainly is. Mushihime-sama is already a great shooter. It's a testament to Cave's ability to deliver intense and fulfilling STG action. It's a required play for 2D shooter fans. When you add v1.5 to the mix, you're cranking Mushihime-sama to 11.<br><br>As with the main game, there are three modes of play: Original, Maniac, and Ultra. In your first experience with the game, you're liable to choose Original and start with standard weapons. What follows is a version of the game that isn't too different from...well...Original Mushihime-sama. The bullet-patterns are similar, the stages and subsequent boss-fights have changed somewhat, but everything is a bit easier. How much easier? I cleared 1.5 Original without continuing on my very first try. As of this writing I haven't cleared ANY of the modes in Vanilla Mushi, unless you count Novice (hah). If you want to get the most out of this setting, you have to dig a little deeper.<br><br>One of the noticeable changes in v1.5 is that enemies drop a lot of gems when you're nearby. Your weapons are also more powerful, so you'll wipe out even the toughest foes in a short amount of time. Because of these changes, you'll adopt a more aggressive style of play. Suddenly you've got fire in your eyes, and you're pushing yourself further, just to wring out an extra couple thousand points.  Still, it's the conservative players that will see the most success, thanks to the massive end-game bonuses for remaining lives. On the bright side, at least the minor additions to the scoring system make v1.5 Original more dynamic when played for score. Maniac and Ultra are are also very similar to their past incarnations. I'm not certain, but Maniac does feel a bit more forgiving in terms of the scoring system. It's easier to maintain the counter, and the extra gems dropped by nearby bugs really add up. Ultra is somewhat more manageable...somewhat. It could be that this mode is finally starting to grow on me. Maybe I should see a doctor about that...<br><br>The real fun begins when you play on MAX. First off, you're at max power from the get-go, and you get an auto-bomb. As with Arrange mode, even if you can manage to grab two or more bombs, your entire stock is cleared out if you get hit. That's not something you can really concern yourself over, because this mode is pure ruthlessness. The Joku fire at a faster rate, and even show off some dirty new tricks. Oddly enough, Ultra MAX is easier for me than any other version. I guess it has something to do with being on sort-of equal terms. I'm used to being out-gunned in 2D shooters, but not being stuck with the pea shooter is a nice benefit.<br><br>Original MAX is a sizable departure from every other mode. Now there's a counter, and a rank system. When the counter goes past 10,000, enemy bullets speed up. Apparently bullets move even faster after 50k and...that's just what I've read. It's the purest example of risk vs reward. By staying close to enemies and accumulating those gems, not only are you in immediate danger, but everything around you is moving faster, leading to more hectic situations. It's wild to consider just how much the game changes when you play for score. You'll welcome every instance of slowdown with open arms.<br><br>I can't stress this enough, Original MAX is worth the price of admission by itself. The only other time I've felt such an incredible rush while playing a 2D shooter, was stage 5 of Mushihime-sama Futari. Even when the bullets are flying by at blinding speeds, I reach this state of zen where I avoid everything with the grace of a swan. Admittedly, this amazing experience is short-lived, because the furthest I can get is the end of stage 4. At least I have something to work towards. The additions to the scoring system also allow for me to test new techniques in the earlier stages. While Original in both vanilla Mushihime-sama and v1.5 is great, MAX flicks all of the adrenaline switches.<br><br>Rounding out this add-on is an arranged soundtrack by the late Ryu Umemoto. One thing I've always noticed about the music of Mushihime-sama; is that there's always a tinge of melancholy amongst the high-adventure tunes. I suppose it could be because this is one of Umemoto's last works - before he passed away at a very young age - but the somber notes really hit home when I play v1.5. There's a lot of emotion that went into this arrangement. This is one of those rare times where I encourage credit-feeding, just to experience stage 5. The music, combined with the action, the bullets, and everything else going on at once. It's really something special.<br><br>To sum it all up, you're doing yourself a disservice if you pass on this DLC. There are three new modes, with two variations of each. That means six ways to play the game. Before you ask, yes there are six different leaderboards. The arranged soundtrack is extremely good, and helps make this journey into the forest just as fresh and superb as ever. Still, as much as I enjoy this v1.5, it doesn't make the original version of Mushihime-sama obsolete. It's a little difficult to re-adjust to how the earlier edition plays, but it's a classic all the same.<br><br><i>Disclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.<\/i><br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18901847', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18901847' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18901847\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18901847' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18901847\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18901847', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18901847_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18901847_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21590848\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055981406\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"95715678\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/68\/687a7b82567a49ec16706904d0859792669e80ca.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/68\/687a7b82567a49ec16706904d0859792669e80ca.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/68\/687a7b82567a49ec16706904d0859792669e80ca_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055981406\/\" data-miniprofile=\"95715678\">majinsteph<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055981406\/games\/?tab=all\">79 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055981406\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055981406\/recommended\/387920\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you enjoy Mushihimesama at all, you need this DLC.  The 1.5 version really makes you rethink how to approach enemies and starting out with 2 options, plus a fully powered up weapon if you activate MAX mode is just so much fun.  I think my favorite thing about this mode is the soundtrack though.  The late Ryu Umemoto really brings a new flavor to each stage with his arrangements and the sound contributes so much to really making the stages feel different.  1.5 is probably my favorite mode in all of Mushihimesama!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21590848', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21590848' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21590848\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21590848' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21590848\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21590848', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21590848_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21590848_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19017505\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/coolronz\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"27733964\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f2a85f612a664b9d78f0a2c2d22324dff7c97ad.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f2a85f612a664b9d78f0a2c2d22324dff7c97ad.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f2a85f612a664b9d78f0a2c2d22324dff7c97ad_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/coolronz\/\" data-miniprofile=\"27733964\">coolRONz<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/coolronz\/games\/?tab=all\">1,303 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/coolronz\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/coolronz\/recommended\/387920\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMakes a great game even better. As a casual gamer, I would have to say I don't really like harder, but this DLC is a little different, I would have to say its a challenge, but a nice change of pace too. But also since a little more going on, on the screen, seems to be a bit more slow down here and there, not sure if that supposed to be there or just to help players get out of tougher situations, almost bullet-time'ish. I don't honestly find it annoying though, its as though the ARCADE board isnt fast enough and its just replicating that on your PC. The voice overs, upbeat tempo's and music really do bring this fun little shooter to life. Overall, in my opinion, this is the funnest SHMUP STEAM has to offer and with this DLC its even funner. Not sure if this shouldn't have been included in the game itself, but honestly it doesn't matter, well worth the little extra. The XBox360 has so many overseas titles to its name, its hard to believe developers\/publishers haven't brought more stuff like this to STEAM. Nice job CAVE, two thumbs up!
