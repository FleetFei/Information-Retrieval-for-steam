The developer is active on the forums and seems intent on polishing it further, so I will recommend that you check it out if you\u2019re interested in a fun take on a streamlined space 4X game. If you are looking instead for a polished game I would say that you look for something else, even though the game\u2019s price tag isn\u2019t exactly going to be much of an obstacle. <br><br>In this game, you\u2019ll be able to colonize planets, build fleets, conduct research, engage in (very minor) diplomacy, and so forth. However, each planet will only be able to perform a single task: build a ship, send out a colony, attack, and so forth. Most of the time, you\u2019ll give a few planets some orders and then click \u2018Auto\u2019 in the \u2018Empire\u2019 menu to have all of your other planets simply generate revenue for you to spend next turn. <br><br>I like the graphics, despite the fact that they were obviously made for a much smaller screen (see below). I especially like the character design for the different alien races, with the Dev\u2019Orn \u2013 a warrior species where individuals appear to be encased in metal armour \u2013 a particular favourite of mine. I feel that with some spit and polish, the game can be improved remarkably. <br><br>In short, this is an interesting game with lots of potential. I love 4X games, but I seldom have the time to spend 20 hours in a single campaign. I\u2019d prefer for there to be more games that give you a 4X fix without being so time-consuming. As such, I\u2019m always interested in more streamlined approaches to space conquest games in the mould of the original Master of Orion, and as such Vincero Totus Astrum caught my attention. <br><br>Sadly, there are a few negative aspects that I wish to point out in hopes that the developer may be able to address them. This is a mobile port \u2013 the game was originally released on iOS \u2013 and as such the interface feels a little large and cumbersome on my 21&quot;, 1080p screen. For example, I wish that fleets that were stationed at a planet were indicated using an icon. Right now, when you look at the map, you won\u2019t be able to tell which planets have fleets and which don\u2019t unless you select the planet in question and check out the \u2018Deploy\u2019 menu or go to the Colony information screen. <br><br>Likewise, the game doesn\u2019t tell you at all if an enemy planet has a fleet stationed there. Before combat, you have to select a few options, such as how to deploy your fleet, but when you have no clue as regards the composition of the enemy fleet, how can you make any meaningful decisions? Do they have a small fleet composed entirely of fighters, or a large fleet complete with frigates and capital vessels? There is, as far as I can tell, no way to find out, except perhaps later via espionage. The game is stingy when it comes to doling out useful information. <br><br>I\u2019ve also encountered strange bugs (?) when attacking an enemy planet. Sometimes, I appear to have destroyed the enemy fleet, but the planet doesn\u2019t switch to my side. According to the in-game help, a planet should join your empire if all defences in the system have been taken down. Secondly,  whenever the battle results in a draw (with you, as the player, being the attacker), the game treats it as if nothing happened. You can use the same planet to attack again, using the exact same ships to fight the enemy fleet, with apparently none of the casualties of the previous battle having been removed from either fleet. <br><br>Finally, the text in the game is marred by typos and grammar mistakes. The in-game help is much appreciated, but the text is a little mangled at times. Likewise, the introductory texts displayed at the start of the game also suffer from mistakes. Here\u2019s a bit from the Dev\u2019Orn: \u2018We are prepared to being conquering [sic] the galaxy Sire,\u2019 and so forth. Punctuation seems to be all over the place, and there are also quite a few run-on sentences. That\u2019s a pity, since there\u2019s not a huge amount of text in the game; these errors could be easily corrected. I\u2019d even volunteer for that.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30529750', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30529750' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30529750\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30529750' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30529750\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30529750', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30529750_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30529750_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/314610\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30529750"]}
