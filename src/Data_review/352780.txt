I believe, on my first playthrough, that my first decision didn't take place until about 45 minutes or an hour into the game.<br><br>Which brings me to my larger point: this is a game for people who like to read and really enjoy a story. Decisions are fundamental to the game and many of them directly impact which ending you're going to experience, but you won't be choosing little things all the time. You'll be making big decisions, the narrative will be allowing the characters to make the small decisions.<br><br>That said, and it's said simply to inform so as to help those who might buy the game to avoid any confusion or frustration with the style of the game, and as I said before: the story is fantastic. There was a great deal of care and consideration put into the writing of this work, there are moral and social quandaries and complexities which are shown to the player and, depending on player choices, the player gets to see the difficult (and not wrong) decisions and opinions formed based entirely on the perspective of the character.<br><br>As one character says in the game, in a battle there are no good guys and bad guys. We all go through life convinced that we're right. Those of us who fight do so because we believe we'll get justice. Gilligan suggested that all violence is created by people seeking justice who believe they deserve something which they're being deprived of: be it respect, objects, or any number of other complex social equations. Violence is the attempt to replace feelings of shame and inadequacy with pride and worth. The writing in this game is good enough that it successfully creates multi-faceted characters who always have reasons for whatever violence they might create, and the game creates such a complex social tapestry that it's easy to see how the individuals (on both sides of the conflict) are, in their own way and with their own limited perspectives, right.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15259022', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15259022' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15259022\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15259022' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15259022\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15259022', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15259022_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15259022_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16749423\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"117837149\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ed\/ede26096ebf8c63936e31eabf76f33c16954052e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ed\/ede26096ebf8c63936e31eabf76f33c16954052e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ed\/ede26096ebf8c63936e31eabf76f33c16954052e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/\" data-miniprofile=\"117837149\">suikoder<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/games\/?tab=all\">5,542 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/suikoder\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 27, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI think that it's best to go into this VN blind, that's why I'm putting part of my review in spoiler tags. These aren't really spoilers but rather surprising things.<br>An Octave Higher is an interesting VN, I could recommend for anybody, mostly because it's not a dating sim, it's not lewd, it's not gory or depressing, nor silly. <br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>It is a branching story about people, music, magic, science, revolution, betrayal and life.<br>It has multiple main characters, or rather story is told from point of view of several characters, what's unusual for a VN. <br>There aren't that many choices, but most of those matter. As the story is branching, there are several endings.<br>A game is accompanied by classical music, what's also somewhat unusual.

It isn't a plausible story with all of its sorcery and magic spells, but also seems to be a lot less fantistical then the sort of dragon and giant spider fighting fantasy stories you might expect as well.<br><br>So far, the writing seems well done, and the art work is really nice.  I am impressed both visually with the art and the writing so far, about 15% through the game.  (You can check your progress at any point from the main menu)<br><br>Considering I am reading this story for my YouTube videos so far, and I am pace for about 10 hours, most people not reading the dialogue aloud will probably read at least twice as fast.  I'd guess this is a 3 to 5 hour game for most people, which will depend greatly on the user naturally with how fast they read or 'skim over' the writing.<br><br>Be advised at I just barely got into some pretty mature and very sexual-in-nature content at the 15% mark.  I was kind of surprised by this and the fact that there was no mention anywhere that I saw that this game\/novel included sexual or adult content.  No nude art as of yet, but pretty mature sexually natured dialogue, and I can see that it might get much more graphic in the near future.  I will update this as I play through, but BE ADVISED THAT THIS GAME MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN\/MINORS ESPECIALLY YOUNGER CHILDRED UNDER THE AGE OF 14 OR SO.<br><br>So far, I have enjoyed it, so at this early point I will give it a thumbs up with the understanding that I may change this entire review and even my recommendation at any time.  But right now, with the amount of content, the quality of the writing, the entertainment value, and the really nice artwork, I'd give this a thumbs up to anyone who enjoys this kind of game and\/or novel.  <br><br>At this point 15% in, there has been NO choices, and NO gameplay at all.  It's just reading and clicking the screen to move forward.  This is fine for me, as I'm sure choices will be made at some point, but I realize this might upset some people, which is why I have pointed this out.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15075522', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15075522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15075522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15075522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15075522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15075522', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15075522_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15075522_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16433614\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"106924073\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/\" data-miniprofile=\"106924073\">Ceaseless Duality<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/games\/?tab=all\">214 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/recommended\/\">66 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was truly a big surprise. I like visual novels despite that a fair amount of them have weak storylines, but this visual novel's story was not weak at all. It was surprisingly well-done and just awesome. Honestly, it could've made a decent storyline for a RPG, but I know indie companies don't always have the money for that. <br><br>The point-of-view switches between three different characters. I like this because it allows the reader to see from different story perspectives. It also doesn't cater to one character's biased interpretations of events. After playing through the game a lot, I must say that I think Elise is supposed to be the main character of the three. <br><br>The achievements for this game comprise of 5 endings and 1 easter egg. There is also a 6th ending that doesn't yield an achievement (because it's neutral\/generic). The easter egg is hilarious, by the way.<br><br>The artwork of this game is impressive. Although, sometimes the characters look a bit awkward in how they're drawn. <br><br>The music is lovely. Quite lovely. This is to be expected considering the title of the game.<br><br>I definitely recommend this game for those who like visual novels! It might also serve to be a good game to introduce someone to visual novels, since it's definitely one of the better ones out there.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16433614', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16433614' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16433614\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16433614' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16433614\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16433614', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16433614_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16433614_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19641907\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrRokuro-san\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"288971576\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9cdc6014f74ff7ea1a0ca4930fa3bf537461d500.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9cdc6014f74ff7ea1a0ca4930fa3bf537461d500.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9cdc6014f74ff7ea1a0ca4930fa3bf537461d500_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrRokuro-san\/\" data-miniprofile=\"288971576\">Mr. Hugh Mannity<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrRokuro-san\/games\/?tab=all\">423 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrRokuro-san\/recommended\/\">45 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrRokuro-san\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOkay this is the first time I reviewed a VN (I did one before with A Kiss for the Petals though that's not a 'proper' review imo) on Steam so bear with me, okay?<br><br>I count myself among the minority seeking out for more narrative-driven games and for better narratives within them.  And in this sense, I adore visual novels genre. So, when this gem showed up on my recommendation list, I wasn't expecting much. Maybe some average story, a couple silly characters, that sort of thing. What I got, instead, was a journey to an entirely new and exciting world that left me with a feeling of intrigue and a longing to someday return. A story about how circumstances can divide people.<br><br>Set in the city of Overture, a large city in the midst of an industrial revolution spurned by the discovery and implementation of magic, An Octave Higher comprises a nest of concrete and steel itself governed by the marriage of science and magic... that you might even call it magical science. From scientific theory to engineered machines, mana and the powers it provides Overture in its entirety. As you can probably tell, the story revolves around magic, where it is the key to it all: education, industries, to the country\u2019s militia, and is even used in everyday livelihoods for the upper districts and for those who can afford mana potions. Anyone with a mana potion can cast spells, and must do so if they want to live comfortably. Heated water? That calls for fire magic, born from the Courage attribute. Want healing? Summon your Compassion. Omnibuses, the flying taxis of the city, operate on wind and gravity magic (Faith and Willpower).<br><br>But magic is far from a catch-all solution if not without costs... It\u2019s borne problems of its own as the city is divided into a three-class system. The Aristocrats on top are the wealthiest, living in their manors and are in charge of most industries of any and all magic machines. The Bourgeois are the middle class where most can afford to use magic and to go to schools that teach the usage of magic. They primarily live in the middle city that takes care of itself. Lastly, the Proles, who make up the poor class that you will usually see in dead-end jobs, are rotting in the shanty towns that make up the lower quarters of Overture. Where the lower class is consistently in awe of the magic and machinery that the rich take for granted, the upper-class look down upon the proles, who grow more and more resentful. Poor citizens are reduced to being compared to simple parts in a machine, and at a certain point in the game we overhear a conversation among factory owners who weigh costs between buying new machinery or hiring more workers.<br><br>And this is where we meet our three main protagonists and their respective roles in society. There's Frederic, an aristocrat brat who is pretty much awful to everyone he interacts with despite being a great sorcer player. Soon after, we meet Franz, a well-off student and researcher at the local university. And finally Elise, a young factory worker who lives at a brothel and in a few short months is expected to join the ranks. The narrative jumps around between these three characters liberally and it does effectively convey what everyone is thinking about in any particular situation.<br><br>At this point, I can't say enough about the writing. The pacing is excellent, and it encapsulates world building to an almost perfect point. In every instance, the writers find ways to explain details to players. Questions such as: what does the average factory worker's day entail? How does this machine work? What are the rules of the arena sports game, Sorcer? All of these details are provided in context. Another aspect of the game I really loved was the complex theories of magic layered within it. I have no doubt that the game developers spent many hours getting the magic theories down to a science (like its clever use of using magic theories in place of real mathematics), and the end result presented to us definitely allowed me to further immerse myself in the rich fantastical world of Overture. I do wish there was voice-acting in the game though, as that would have definitely aided in the immersion experience.<br><br>The music, while a bit lacking in variety, is pleasant and soothing. This gives gameplay a relaxing and calming effect, which in turn causes the hours of playtime to quietly float by. Sound effects within the game have a tendency to fall flat, but they aren't distracting and don't take away from the experience. <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed playing this visual novel and it is undoubtedly one of the better visual novels I've played in recent memory. I grew really fond of the game's setting and characters by the end of the story, and I believe that the game's world still has a lot of potential left to be explored. This visual novel is one that fans of fantasy stories should definitely give a try! And by the way, the developer, Kidalang, already announced a prequel to this game called <b> A Small Fire at a Time <\/b> so make sure to look out for it!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19641907', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19641907' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19641907\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19641907' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19641907\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19641907', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19641907_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19641907_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15268397\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045255782\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"84990054\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/82\/82d7e5b2f4618c2b07c7089ad699a53471f59744.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/82\/82d7e5b2f4618c2b07c7089ad699a53471f59744.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/82\/82d7e5b2f4618c2b07c7089ad699a53471f59744_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045255782\/\" data-miniprofile=\"84990054\">Moppit<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045255782\/games\/?tab=all\">930 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045255782\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045255782\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 8, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally enjoy my time with &quot;An Octave Higher&quot;. Espically a story about flaws of a system that can't easily be change but that is not fair. How you go through the perspective of people living on both sides of the system on where the rich keeps get richer and the poor ends up suffering more and more. How people keep suffering until they can't handle it no more. Also really enjoy the art and piano scores through out the game. If I have to point faults there are a few but my opinion. Sometimes they lose story on spending so much time on one side of the system. There is no window mode as far I can tell. When you hide the text try to take a screen shot the text pops right back up while your doing it. Outside of that would reccommend this to anyone. Plus one of the achievements is misleading the &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; one.

The story is told from the alternating perspectives of three characters brought together by an unusual research project: Frederic, a narcissistic aristocrat; Franz, a brilliant but asocial student of magic; and Elise, a factory worker who dreams of being a musician.<br><br>While the story can be heavy on exposition at times, it's necessary to explain the complex and unique way magic works in the city of Overture in order for the plot to make sense. And aside from a bit of awkwardness when it comes to fitting those details into conversation, the story is really well-written. It's full of original ideas and morally complex characters, and while it's mostly pretty serious and dramatic, it has its moments of comedy as well.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed it, and I recommend it to anyone else who wants a good visual novel that's not too long. Make sure you don't stop after one ending, as there are several, some of which involve a much longer story than the others. I'd love it if the creators wrote more stories that take place in this world.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17936558', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17936558' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17936558\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17936558' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17936558\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17936558', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17936558_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17936558_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17192248\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sailortralfamadore\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"178451440\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9c2ae338409484f6074d994aa78475a633b10bb8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9c2ae338409484f6074d994aa78475a633b10bb8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9c\/9c2ae338409484f6074d994aa78475a633b10bb8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sailortralfamadore\/\" data-miniprofile=\"178451440\">SailorTralfamadore<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sailortralfamadore\/games\/?tab=all\">85 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sailortralfamadore\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sailortralfamadore\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn Octave Higher is a very refreshing, different kind of visual novel. it looks pretty typical with its steampunk-fantasy setting and magical battle elements, but it doesn't end there at all. It also isn't very romance-focused, despite looking like it will be that way at first. Still, it's neat to see something with a steampunk setting that actually deals with the social and political conflicts of the time. Its handling of the topics is really high-school-level &quot;intro to communism,&quot; but that still gives it stronger themes than most visual novels. Plus, it has some really engaging, well-written characters. If you can deal with it getting a little soapbox-y and the sometimes-cheesy overuse of music references, it's a lot of fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17192248', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17192248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17192248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17192248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17192248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17192248', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17192248_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17192248_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30704965\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198155659382\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"195393654\">Mr Orange<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am a big comic collector &amp; have never come across this style before......

The writing is just human and realistic in every way, the characters personalitys, relationships and developments are clearly visible and the dialogues are pretty much perfect in my opinion.<br>I laughed a lot, was happy, angry, got sad and even teared up at some point of the novel (not crying), i was very intrigued by the story and wanted to know more and more about what happens next.<br><br>There are a lot of funny and serious moments, which really made me think about the game and everything around it, because it is in some way relatable to the world we live in.<br>If you go for all the different endings you will also get another perspective about specific scenarios, which left me in a lot of thought as well, because almost every character and their motives are relatable and personally.. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>i couldnt really find a bad guy after finishing the novel, except the rabbits? and Joff maybe<\/span><\/span>.<br><br>The handdrawn art in this game is looking great for me and fits into almost evey scenario. <br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>There was one fight where the character models where spinning around each other, which was supposed to be a serious moment, but it got me by surprise so i burst out in laughter<\/span><\/span><br><br>The character drawings and different facial expressions were mostly fitting and looked pretty good and appealing to me.<br>I didnt like fredericks expressions too much, because it didnt really fit into the situations and didnt fit his character, but pretty much every other character worked perfectly with it.<br><br>The soundtrack in this game is also just fine and works out well with the scenery, so i have nothing to complain about it. The developers also did a good job in timing the music with the events or even leaving it out for some completely, giving it an even better atmosphere.<br><br><br><br>All in all i am just amazed by this novel and how good it was, even though i never played one (and never really felt like doing it).<br>I had this game on my list for a long time and now that it got reduced to the price of a sandwich and an apple i just bought it without thinking too much about it.<br>I was not disappointed in the slightest, but i feel a bit bad, because the game is worth the full price in my opinion, so i got it for a friend as well, who would never buy a visual novel by himself :P <br><br>Just try it out if you are even interested in the slightest bit, i mean, why not?\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30669835', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30669835' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30669835\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30669835' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30669835\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30669835', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30669835_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30669835_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30564620\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198042601745\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"82336017\">a_really_high_elf<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 20.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat story, premise, and aesthetics.

I love the themes this game explored though. Not only was magic explained in a scientific way - they explored careers, research, ways in which magic exists as a tool that this society exploits at every turn. Next, the political standpoints of society from a bourgeoise and proletariat perspective immediately called to me as a sociology lover. The political affairs were beautifully explained. Godwin as evil; Godwin as self fulfilling; Godwin as a business man. Is he evil? Who knows because life is literally filled with greys. The work doesn't have any solutions, nor does it claim them, but what I absolutely LOVED was this real portrayal of revolution. Often, it is romanticized as a solution - but it's not a solution, is it? This gets it point across beautifully.<br><br>Also, the characters. I would never have thought Franz would change as much as he did - into Amadeus, a mask, a figurehead for Libertad. When he claims Amadeus was just a role he was playing and then revealed his face, and his inability to do magic, it was so breathtaking. He stayed completely covered until the final moments before he died - where he spoke of peace and was literally decimated by the police. A perfect martyr. My heart aches for his plight.<br><br>I was delightfully surprised by the character development Frederic had towards the end, as well!  I thought he was never going to embrace his compassion affinity - but he did and then.. his death hurt. I was really hoping there was redemption for him and his relationship with Elise. I wanted that so badly.<br><br>Lastly, I just want to say the last scene, when Elize tries to revive Franz after he dies and then the PIANO \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING WORKS when the little boy accidentally touches it just ruined me. What an amazing ending - it is bittersweet but also filled with possibilities and symbolizes the potential of humanity and the potential of magic as mystical and inexplicable. <\/span><\/span><br><br>I wish I had my thoughts collected enough to write an in-depth review of how symbolic I found this work. I want to echo what others have said. Sometimes, the choices CAN feel arbitrary and they aren't many for the first hour of gameplay But, the story telling is just fantastic.<br><br>However, if you take anything from my review, just take this: buy and experience this game for yourself. It's worth it. It is literally unpredictable and just thrilling to experience from the first moment you open it up and the sorcer match begins... <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30325061', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30325061' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30325061\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30325061' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30325061\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30325061', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30325061_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30325061_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29601220\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Echocatt\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"294239427\">Echocatt<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>TL;DR<\/b> Give it a chance. But also, buy it on sale.<br><br>An Octave Higher is a difficult game for me to review properly. Playing through the endings, with the exception of a few points in each, I really enjoyed the game. However, as the mixed review status of this VN may have hinted, the game isn\u2019t without its flaws. Strengths in universe-building and the magic system are contrasted by a somewhat shaky plot and flat leads. But at the end of the day, I liked this VN a lot. For me, An Octave Higher is a nostalgic work. It reminds me of the sorts of artistic narrative-driven games I used to play as a child, like the Professor Layton series. It\u2019s not perfect, but compared to a lot of other cheap VNs available on this site, it\u2019s fairly good. While I find it does deserve a lot of the criticism I\u2019ve seen other reviewers throw at it, it also deserves a chance.<br><br>After playing through all 7 endings, here are my thoughts:<br><br><i>[Spoiler Warning]<br> [Major spoilers are tagged, but general discussions are left. Read at your own risk. Discussed endings are named by their corresponding achievements]<\/i><br><br>Pros (+)<br>+Interesting primary universe. Overture shines as a fantasy city.<br>+Fascinating magic system. Applying science to magic makes it an actual, comprehensible field that makes readers feel a very real connection to it.<br>+Gorgeous background art and lighting choices breathe life into Overture.<br>+Soundtrack is great, especially the main theme<br>+Fights are clever and well-paced, as well as accompanied by relevant visual aid. Although nothing is strictly animated, the fights never ceased to have me on the edge of my seat.<br>+Thorough economic system, and clever world-building around a magic-based technological society. This especially as expanded by Janis Woolf in <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> <b>Why not?<\/b><\/span><\/span><br>+Addresses the good\/evil divide in a more complex manner than simply claiming one side right and the other wrong. For a fantasy work, it\u2019s a refreshing change.<br>+Characters are likeable despite a few flaws in their writing.<br>+As far as tradables go, this game does pretty well. Cards are pretty fair quality, although a bit expensive. Emoticons are pretty average, nothing amazing but nothing totally worthless either. What really shines is the backgrounds. Hope you get lucky and land one of the rares. And even if you don\u2019t the common backgrounds are still really pretty.<br>+Everything following the timeskip in <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>So beautiful and lost and Why not?<\/span><\/span> is really good.<br>+Easy to get 100% achievements. Always a nice touch.<br><br><br>Neutral (\u2022)<br>\u2022A few other reviews cite the lack of music-related magic or the importance of music in the story as a major complaint. While they\u2019re not wrong, most of this criticism is unfounded. Beyond the title (which is likely only used for dramatic effect) there\u2019s no promise that music will be the unifying force of this story. And, quite appropriately, it\u2019s not. Although in the <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span><b>Why not? (true)<\/b><\/span><\/span> ending it does ending up playing a bigger role.<br>\u2022The <b>neutral ending, Your afternoon tea My Lord, Egregia \u2665\u2665\u2665 laude, Whatever I know about magic<\/b>, and <b>the Hidden Achievement (Happily Ever After)<\/b> are all parallel endings, with only minor variations between them. They also completely miss out on the back half of the game (post timeskip). If you get one of these endings, I urge you to keep playing for one of the others.<br>\u2022Somewhat unsurprisingly, the true ending is objectively the best one.<br><br>Cons (-)<br>-Out of the 7 endings, all but 2 <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>(<b>So beautiful and lost<\/b> and <b>Why not?<\/b>)<\/span><\/span> come about abruptly and are mostly unsatisfying. In each of these cases, after a certain event the story just\u2026ends. A lot of loose ends are disregarded or swept under the rug, and you\u2019re left with these sense of missing so much from the story and the universe.<br>-The ending for <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span><b>Your afternoon tea, My Lord<\/b><\/span><\/span> was especially disappointing, especially given some tasteless and honestly out of place \u201cfanservice\u201d snuck in at the end.<br>-The two main leads \u2013 Franz and Elise \u2013 are pretty flat characters. Hints of potential development are scattered throughout the story, but unfortunately aren\u2019t explored. While not unlikeable, on many occasions they only serve to advance the story.<br>-On the topic of flat characters, Franz didn\u2019t get nearly enough development, or even express enough of an opinion about the bourgeoisie\/proletariat divide <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> to make his assuming the role of Amadeus feel natural.<\/span><\/span> More development would have been appreciated.<br>-The plot involving <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Compassion magic<\/span><\/span> that drives our 4 mains together doesn\u2019t pan out in any but the <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Why not?<\/span><\/span> ending. After all of the buildup, the outcome was pretty disappointing.<br>- The Libertad\u2019s establishing characterization is weak. A greater connection to the initial plot or one of the main characters would have been appreciated. However, they do improve significantly after the timeskip in <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span><b>So beautiful and lost<\/b> and <b>Why not?<\/b><\/span><\/span><br>-No back button for dialogue. While there is a text log accessible through the menu, there\u2019s no effective rewind button beyond loading old saves.<br>-The fast forward option for dialogue chooses what to skip through based on what text you as a player have or haven\u2019t seen before, even if dialogue between different endings (given slightly different choices) is basically the same. A comprehensive, or at least less conditional, skip function would be appreciated.<br><br>Despite these, An Octave Higher is still a very good game. I urge you to give it a shot. However, as mentioned previously, buy it on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29601220', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29601220' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29601220\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29601220' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29601220\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29601220', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29601220_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29601220_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29404412\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198128382546\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"168116818\">JayfeatherRex<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>An Octave Higher<\/i> is well worth the cost with about 7 hours (playing all routes).  It takes about 3 hours to complete the story the first time, but only if you are doing one of the shorter playthroughs.  It's pretty standard VN gameplay with text, visuals, music, and choices.  The choices influence the story very much and I highly suggest playing all routes.  All of the endings have different emotions associated with them.  The True Ending is sweet and sad and is very well written.<br><br>Overall: A\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29404412', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29404412' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29404412\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29404412' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29404412\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29404412', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29404412_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29404412_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29231815\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053041265\/recommended\/352780\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"92775537\">slicedara<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm usually quite picky with visual novels, but I quite liked An Octave Higher!

You don't have to possess any knowledge on the topics, but those who kow will appreciate the added depth).<br><br>As fellow reviewers had noted, the pace-tone shift might be somewhat jarring (between the first and second act), and I can see why it could seem like two different games. However, despite a few plotholes here and there, An Octave Higher offers you a world worthy to experience. I like that this Visual Novel does not try to force-advance character relationships romantically, instead focusing on their roles in the story.<br><br>The writers tried to give nuanced personality to every character so none appeared particularly good or bad, but somewhere in the gray area. A commendable effort, though some might come across as being 'tryhard'. Perhaps the prequel would make up for this.<br><br>For those who like their stories tied up neatly, however, An Octave Higher might leave you wanting. The ending is open to interpretation, and some plot points were loosely let go. <br><br>Spoiler: <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Frederic's ending<\/span><\/span> was so damn weird. I wonder whether the writers had run out of ideas at that point or that they thought they should at least offer that ending as a lighthearted option. <br><br>May provide a more detailed review later.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28935986', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28935986' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28935986\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28935986' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28935986\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28935986', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28935986_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28935986_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/352780\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 141 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["18563846","15259022","16749423","15075522","16433614","19641907","15268397","28712002","17936558","17192248"]}
