I am delighted by the general premise, that the story doesn't stop at the 'happy ending', that married life can be tough and as much of an adventure as dating. <br>\tThe art style is very familiar for fans of Winter Wolves' games, though they have re-used quite a bit of artwork (mostly background) from other games, which means Amy may be living in the house the characters 'Roommates' inhabited, and the same town as 'Nicole' went to university. However this is a minor detail and can largely be ignored in favour of story and characters. <br>\tThe game follows on from the special endings of 'Always Remember Me' with the protagonist, Amy, married to whichever boy you picked. (You can set which route you want to play, so no need for save games). Each marriage has it's own set of problems, from jealousy, to recovering from abuse. Amy is just as much a wet blanket as she was in the first game, but this does at least make the few moments when she asserts herself all the more satisfying, even if this does occasionally lead to the sad ending. I'm not sure if the message here is 'Never stand up for yourself or you'll end up alone' or 'Tact and diplomacy are important life skills'. There are a few minor issues, such as a therapist telling her client that (potentially violent) jealousy just means her husband loves her very much, and taking his side about an assault against the protagonist. But mostly the game is enjoyable and reasonably compelling. <br>\tAt any rate this game is effectively 4 games in one, each route features 5 different endings (two sad, two happy, one neutral) as well as special epilogues (one for happy endings, one for sad endings). <br>\tThe game can be played as a visual novel (which is useful if you wish to replay a favourite story), or as a visual novel tied to a stat raising system reminiscent of 'Heirs and Graces'. <br>\tAll in all this game is delightful, though simple. No competition for Winter Wolves' best games, but still pretty solid provided you like the protagonist.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29944002', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29944002' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29944002\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29944002' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29944002\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29944002', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29944002_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29944002_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/534980\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 3 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29944002"]}
