Especially those that come from generation 4\/5\/6 Final Fantasy. Realizing this is a debut title and is going to have issues, being a fan of this type of game I plan to throw the book at it. Not out of malice, but because I really hope to see this game and future games improved from constructive criticism, rather than take on a holding pattern as a result of unwarranted praise.<br><br>In Whisper of a Rose, you are Melrose, a schoolgirl from a broken home with social issues at school who steals an iDream, an experimental device which allows you to live your dreams, from a museum in which it is to be showcased. In using it, however, she becomes trapped in an inhospitable dream world with no clear way to escape. <br><br>The story itself is well written and functional, and the characters diverse (if archetypal) but I find my relationship with Melrose to be an emotional rollercoaster. I seem to alternate between sympathizing with her plight and wanting to punch her in the face, because there are situations in which she has violent outbursts and behaves like a total b!tch on an irrational level. I mostly settle on indifference to her entirely. <br><br>The visuals, taking into account that the game was built in RPG Maker XP are very good, and I have thus far encountered no bugs or glitches that spring to mind, and experienced no crashes. However the way the interface is designed, while functional could definitely use improvement. When it is an allied character's turn, there are two visual prompts to assist in this - their 'wait bar' fills and turns red, and they flash white. Now, this is usually fine in areas with good colour contrast but in bright areas with really low colour saturation it is really difficult to tell whose turn it is, especially if two characters' wait bars fill simulatenously. Similarly, you are notified that an enemy is charging up an ability to use by the same white flash, which again is not readily apparent in low saturation areas with bright colours. I have little knowledge of the limitations of the RPG Maker interface, but in this regard I feel the battle interface could have been built better. <br><br>That said, the battle animations and particle effects for spells and abilities play out smoothly and are well done, and the diverse beastiary of enemies encountered are appropriately thematic for where they are found and the more cleverly named of them are aptly so. The game maintains an acceptable framerate, and apart from periodic pauses in isolated instances where the game informs me it is 'loading' there is no graphical stuttering.<br><br>Spells are learned inorganically and the screen on which they are learned is better described as a dark cave than a tree. It is needlessly large, and the little amount of the map that is visible on screen gives no clues as to which spells are in which direction until you stumble onto them, wandering aimlessly through it. I honestly would have rather had a cascade menu with each spell, a button press to unlock and branching menus to power up each attribute (Speed, Power, Mana Cost) than this... mess. The way in which Skill Unlock points are obtained makes some semblance of sense, however. Each one is obtained by completing a story segment, usually through defeating a boss. Though gaining Skill Upgrade points is frustrating and nonsensical to say the least, as they are loot objects in dungeons or obtained through talking to NPCs, rather than leveling up. However, the variety of spells and abilities available are fairly vast, each with different effects and power levels, and are unique to each character. I would have preferred a more heuristic approach to learning them, though.<br><br>Which brings me to the next point - magic is WAY overvalued in this game, especially during bosses with adds. At my current playtime I have 3 characters unlocked - the main character, Melrose (summoner), a mage and an archer. Melrose and the archer do little damage of any consequence with their basic attacks, and don't have enough mana to reliably use their spells to deal and recover damage. Whereas the mage, while having really high mana costs can usually wipe the field clean in one area of effect cast, and continue to do this reliably for many battles consecutively as long as the archer feeds her mana with his own abilities. A very big contrast to most other RPGs comparable to this.<br><br>The puzzles present in this game are generally very good, reaching and even exceeding complexity found in games like The Legend of Zelda. I have scratched my head for a while trying to work out exactly what to do with them, and even had to ask for help on one occasion. In this regard I give the game a very high grade.<br><br>The maps are generally well laid out, if sometimes needlessly large and complicated. I felt as if some of the areas were built to have complex routes to navigate through and multiple dead ends for complexity's sake, rather than to actually serve a purpose. Sure, some of them have treasure at the end, but others are just... there. Add to that random collision objects that pepper some of the maps and navigating them can be somewhat frustrating at times, but this is only an issue in very isolated instances and doesn't permeate the entire game. There are also frequently really long distances that need to be travelled through the world map, with no random encounters or treasure to discover to break up the monotony of trekking around the world looking for the next area entrance. <br><br>The crafting available in the game is somewhat esoteric. Recipes are found throughout the game in various places, but the materials required are often not that common without grinding and the interface for crafting is clunky at best. It's often easier to grind currency to buy items at shops and ignore crafting altogether until much later in the game, where crafting seems to be required to create relic quality equipment.<br><br>The music is okay, and what little voice acting is present is well done. I haven't encountered any audio stuttering, glitches or any other annoyances with it. The game has good KBM and gamepad support, though it seems notably easier to play with a gamepad than KBM, but that may just be me and not a rule. <br><br>My understanding is that a playthrough should take 30-40 hours, and with my 9-10 hours into it so far I believe that approximation to be accurate. <br><br>Overall, it's a decent little RPG. Though if you came hoping for something to rival titans like Final Fantasy, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean or Phantasy Star and take a walk down memory lane, you're probably better off spending the couple of extra dollars and getting an actual Final Fantasy game. If you just want a nice little RPG to get your turn-based fix, Whisper of a Rose is for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13133468', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13133468' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13133468\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13133468' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13133468\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13133468', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13133468_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13133468_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t61 of 93 people (66%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">14 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12947735\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"61672835\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ae\/aed7655b9f7705e302bb31f2f9cbf666969f14f3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ae\/aed7655b9f7705e302bb31f2f9cbf666969f14f3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ae\/aed7655b9f7705e302bb31f2f9cbf666969f14f3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/\" data-miniprofile=\"61672835\">Embryo-sama<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/games\/?tab=all\">1,294 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021938563\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">79.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 15, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;this is only a part of the review since I exceeded the allowed number of chars&gt;<br><br><i>Role Playing fans, rejoice! One of the strongest competitors to immortal classics like <b>Final Fantasy IV<\/b> for the SNES or the PC indie titles <b>Aveyond<\/b> and <b>Millennium<\/b> has been released for your playing pleasure. How does <b>Whisper of a Rose<\/b> fare in comparison to cult classics of both the ancient generation of consoles and modern indie classics? Please, take a few minutes to read through this text to find out.<\/i><br><br><b>Whisper of a Rose<\/b>, the debut production of <b>RosePortal Games<\/b>, is perhaps the most often updated title in their catalogue, with each new edition boasting additional content and a myriad of fixes and other updates. It's hard not to see the love for the game and its players in the actions of the developer, who despite working on two completely new titles, never forgot about the fans of the original game from 2009 that can safely be called a cult classic now.<br><br>As with most RPG titles, the vital part of <b>Whisper of a Rose<\/b>'s charm and appeal is its storyline and setting. Set several years into the future, the story features a college student by the name of Melrose, who's struggling to keep her life from completely falling apart. Not only she comes from a poor and pathological family (both parents abusive towards her), but she also faces the everyday problems of school bullies targeting her and most of the other students simply not bothering to even notice her. Eventually, when she finds out about a device that would allow her to travel into a happy and colorful Dreamworld, she immediately decides to get it and use it on herself - ignoring the warning that the iDream is a mere prototype and thus there are certain risks involved with using it.<br><br>And so she ventures forth into the Dreamworld but quickly discovers that it's not the peaceful, happy place it was supposed to be. As opposed to her wishes, it's more often shaped by her fears, both those she well knows of and those residing in her subconsciousness. She is instructed to find a way out of there... and despite her understandable reservations in the beginning, she eventually realizes that she must do so.<br><br>Thus begins her journey, full of sudden twists and mortal dangers.<br><br>The synopsis above may have reminded you about <b>The Wizard of Oz<\/b>, or Carroll's <b>Alice<\/b> - and while it may be bearing many similarities to those, it's also quite original, especially in comparison to many other indie jRPG titles which feature a destined-to-save-the-world protagonist in a fantasy setting, with most of the events being quite easy to predict. Melrose's role isn't to save everyone in the Dreamworld, she's merely a bypasser who's trying to leave. Whether or not she helps some of the NPCs (there's an extensive array of tasks the player is nowhere near being forced to complete in order to progress further) is entirely up to her... or to you. It's a very interesting spectacle of how a young woman matures, with being a self-centered teenager with multiple personal issues in the beginning and becoming a decent and brave young woman not hesitating to do the right thing in the end.<br><br>This is primarily Melrose's story, and via interactions with two of her Dreamworld-born teammates, the player will soon realize that they both serve to show <i>her<\/i> character depth, however not for a moment losing any of their own. However, with the appearance of the last party member, things become even darker than before. Christina may seem like a generic tsundere deadpan snarker at first, but she is also just as well developed a character despite not being the main star of the show. Her fears are much darker than Melrose's and when they are revealed, it becomes fully clear how tragic a past she had.<br><br>If you are a sensitive person and can invest yourself emotionally into the game, you'll find many scenes genuinely moving. I did shed a tear or two while baring witness to the no holds barred beatdown Melrose's deadbeat dad gave her very early in the game, just as I did when at one point her memories were in large part erased and everything looked hopeless. I genuinely felt bad for Christina when the horror of her past became known... and it's a lot from me because I don't cry a whole lot. In fact, almost not at all.<br><br>As far as the visuals go, the game is just as awesome. It takes time (or looking into the game's file structure) to realize that this is RPG Maker XP, due to a variety of reasons: first off, there's barely any stock material left in, mostly limited to spell effects during battles and a few leftover tiles in the areas - the entire remainder of the graphic resources is completely new and fresh. And much more detailed than the RPG Maker stock resources - <i>especially<\/i> the main characters. For pixel art, this is outstandingly realistic - visible limbs, proper body proportions and vivid animation of movement - something previously unseen in RPG Maker based titles. Here's how this looks from the technical perspective: RPG Maker VX and VX Ace titles usually have their chibi characters with heads doubling the size of the rest of the body on a single tile, whereas their predecessor engine RPG Maker XP has them a bit more realistic, utilizing two tiles - out of which one is usually for the face and another for the body. <b>Whisper of a Rose<\/b> uses <i>three tiles<\/i> for a character in total. Go figure. That's not all - the enemies have been given the same treatment as well, being incredibly detailed and fully animated. After this game, I found it hard to readjust to XP standard-size humans, while VX ones became a sight absolutely unbearable for me. That's right: <b>Whisper of a Rose<\/b> is downright beautiful and will steal your heart... <i>No love you will have!<\/i> (as would a certain witch say) Not for any other game, not after this.<br><br>That's not all in terms of graphics - did I mention, there's barely any stock resource in the game? I think I did. Now imagine the fact that there's <i>so damn many<\/i> unique locations I've lost count! We have a modern city, a bare, cloudy dreamworld area, a child's dream candy-filled land, a school - both real-life and nightmarishly twisted, mountain hills, a forest, several different cave systems, a valentine-themed town and an actually unsettling marionette factory. <i>I haven't mentioned all the areas in the first act of the game even... there's four times more areas in <b>Whisper<\/b> and all have original graphics!<\/i><br><br>There's also character avatars - something not available in the regular RPG Maker XP featureset (it was introduced as a stock feature in VX), and there's a lot of those, with more being promised in a future update. They've gotten a redesign since the original release of the game and both versions are equally beautiful. Each of the main characters has several of these avatars at their disposal, allowing them to fully show you the scope of emotions they're going through.<br><br>As for the musical score, it's very extensive and varied. Almost every location has its own main theme and many of the events have special tunes written for them as well. The musical styles are varied, but surprisingly consistent - that includes the new tunes written for this re-release. The music is mostly fresh, with a very small number of tracks being remixes of RPG Maker stocks (I think in the re-release there's just one such track left), or freely available on the internet (of those I think I know two). I've gotten the soundtrack album in the past and every once in a while I give it another whirl because even outside of the game, the enchanting soundtrack stands firm as a smash hit.<br><br>&lt;gameplay and technical aspects of the review in another post&gt;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12947735', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12947735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12947735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12947735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12947735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12947735', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12947735_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12947735_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12977119\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032349122\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"72083394\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6bcb518d20dca53ccc5181afbac6ab0a7d54d154.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6bcb518d20dca53ccc5181afbac6ab0a7d54d154.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6bcb518d20dca53ccc5181afbac6ab0a7d54d154_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032349122\/\" data-miniprofile=\"72083394\">Sadrin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032349122\/games\/?tab=all\">282 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032349122\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198032349122\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen I first saw the trailer I was immediately reminded of Alice in Wonderland and had to get it! I haven't played far yet (and apparently the game is over 25 hours so I still have a long way to go) but here are my thoughts so far:<br><br>Story: Very interesting and bittersweet. I feel like the story was written by a 17 year old girl, but in a good way, because it makes the story and dialogue believable. You also see the story behind the other characters, and it seems like the villains are heroes in their own way. It's very good, I almost teared up at a certain scene in the beginning (no spoilers).<br><br>Graphics: Beautiful! It has a nice old school look. It doesn't look perfect and modern, but that's good, because it fits in with the entire game's &quot;retro&quot; feeling. I've only played a little bit and have already seen SO many different areas with a lot of variation! There's a candy land, sewers, a museum, a dark school, etc.<br><br>Music: Sounds great. Some songs are just &quot;OK&quot;. They fit the mood but are nothing special. Other tracks (like when you fight the first boss) are absolutely amazing. I wish I could fight that boss over and over just to listen to the track!<br><br>Gameplay: The most important part! I really like that Melrose can summon a helper. It makes the beginning of the game more fun and strategic before you get the other main characters in your party. The battles are also real time so you can time your actions with the enemy! It's a lot of fun!<br><br>Conclusion: It's a really amazing game. It's right up to par with To The Moon and Skyborn for me. Actually, as a game it's WAY better! But I still have to finish it so I can't say for sure yet which of the three is best.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12977119', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12977119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12977119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12977119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12977119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12977119', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12977119_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12977119_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12964931\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198074332586\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"114066858\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198074332586\/\" data-miniprofile=\"114066858\">rumariss<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198074332586\/games\/?tab=all\">261 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198074332586\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198074332586\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs far as classic rpg's go, this is like a classic that never happened, almost like a dream (pun completely intended) the story is fresh and interesting like the true twisted face of &quot;wonderland&quot;. The art style is impressive and the music is amazing, the gameplay is reminiscent of old school final fantasy with some current day practices. My only problem is not being able to select the resolution, my screen seems to cut off a little, but beside that little fact, I wish modern rpg's would take a step back and see what an indie can do with a little passion and a whole lot of style.

She finds a device called the iDream and uses that to escape into her Dream World.<br><br>But she ends up finding out that the Dream World isn't as nice as she thinks it is.  After all, not all our dreams are nice and happy, there are plenty of nightmares as well.<br><br>Whisper of a Rose takes us on Melrose's trip through the Dream World.  Everything in the game is based on things that happened to Melrose and her own fears and wishes.  Even her own repressed memories show up at times.  The settings range from rolling hills to unpleasant forests and swamps.  And all Melrose wants to do is find a way home.<br><br>Overall pros:<br>+Lengthy game, it took me just under 30 hours to beat it, though that included having to redo some stuff when I was defeated.<br>+Gorgeous settings, you can barely even tell it's RPG Maker<br>+Wonderful soundtrack.  All the music fits great with the scenes and the battle themes are just amazing.  You can get the soundtrack for free at the dev's website too.<br>+Very responsive dev which is always a good thing.<br><br>Overall cons:<br>-Never thought I'd say I wanted random encounters in a game, but this game really would have been better off with them.  Visible encounters just don't work here with how difficult it is to avoid enemies and how they immediately respawn with no chance for immunity to avoid the encounter.  Monsters also don't stop while you grab treasure which leads to encounters you may not want.  (Edit: This has been improved upon as well with a short delay between respawn and an item to avoid encounters.  New Game+ mode gets an important item to allow unlimited avoiding of encounters)<br>-Regular battles can get lengthy and tedious.  (Edit: This has been improved upon and they are much shorter as long as you aren't avoiding everything and not upgrading equipment)<br>-While there is a quick means of travel, it only covers limited areas and you'll be backtracking a bit for sidequests, which makes the encounter annoyances even greater because you'll get stuck fighting some monsters when you just wanted to make a quick run to grab an item.<br><br>Achievement wise, it's not an easy 100%.  You'll need two full playthroughs to 100% the game and there are a few missables.  It's about 30 hours per playthrough from the looks of things if you want to be sure to miss nothing.  There is some replay value though since you get some new stuff on a second run and there's one sidequest that can only be finished on the second playthrough and it nets you the best summon in the game.<br><br>Still, it's a very good game and I do recommend it.  It's not exactly short and sweet, but it's worth playing all the way through.<br><br>Also a little tip for anyone playing it: don't sell your initial armor for any characters.  You'll need that later if you want to get the best stuff in the game.  It's doable to beat the game without it, but more difficult.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17219070', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17219070' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17219070\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17219070' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17219070\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17219070', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17219070_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17219070_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22131522\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"51625428\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51625428\">Jargonaut<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/games\/?tab=all\">612 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">157.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love this game and has been playing it for 100+ hours.<br>I would like to recommend this game to those that love good RPG Maker games with an excellent storyline.<br><br>You can play this game as a Warrior, Paladin or Summoner. In this game the Summoner is the most interesting character which also enables you to unlock a lot more achievements. The combat mechanics is interesting as you play with different form of elemental damages (fire, water, air, earth)  which are resisted by different degrees by different monsters. You also alternate between real and dream worlds. <br><br>Unlike most other RPGs, you do not gain skill points as you gain more experiences and levels. You need to explore every nook and cranny to look for skill upgrade points. You also need to talk to every character and do every quests to get skill upgrade and unlock points as well as better gears. As a summoner, you can also unlock different creatures to summon through various quests as well.<br><br>There is also an excellent crafting mechanism in this game as well. The best armors in this game, called Relic Armors cannot be bought or received as drops from monsters. They need to be crafted using various crafting items, as well as some very difficult to get monsters drop. Furthermore you need to keep your very first set of armor for all 4 characters as well, because you need to use them to craft Relic armors at the very end.<br><br>You can buy better weapons from differnet vendors in this game, but the very best weapons, called Ultimate Weapons can only be receive through quests too. Hence this elevate the importance of doing all quests.<br><br>To get all achievements, you will need to play this game twice, and hence giving it more replay value. This is because there is a New Journey+ mode which can only be unlocked when you finished the game. Furthermore there are quest that are started during your first game which can only be completed during the New Journey+ as well. So the achievements associated with these quests can only be received if you play the game twice.<br><br>The second time you play this game, you get a lot of benefits, including new skill sets which can only be unlocked in New Journey+ You can also get better creatures to summon and start of with certain crafting recipes which are not present in the first game. I have started on my New Journey+ and this game is still sustaining my interests even though I am playing it a second time.<br><br>This is a great game. The only shortcoming I can think of is that the graphics are OK, but not top-notched. However, considering that I got the game on sale at about $10, this game is defintely worth its weight in gold, in terms of the enjoyment value and the time played.<br><br>-------------------Review Update after Finishing New Journey+ ---------------------------<br>I am finally done with this game, after 156 hours <br>I played the game twice, and finished New Journey+ with allthe steam achievements.<br><br>In the end, all my characters were at level 47, and I had 31 DRAGON TEETH.<br>I just love grinding that green dragon for lots of XP and orbs.<br>That dragon also got me a lot of levels too!!!!<br><br>All my characters were equipped with Relic Armors and Ultimate Weapons.<br>I also made 4 of those awesome Tanzanite Rings with game my characters +9 magic attack and +3 magic defense. In the end, Helenna's Tornado was so overpowering that she can wiped out all the enemies in a single turn (equipped with Relic Armor, Ultimate Weapon and Tanzanite Ring).<br><br>I simply fell in love with this game, and that is why I spend 156 hours on it.<br><br>I put the prequel, &quot;Sweet Lily Dreams&quot; on my wishlist and will buy it when it is on sale. I am sure I will enjoy the prequel very much too. <br><br>Once again, thank you for the wonderful game, developer Lucia Silvermoon !!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22131522', 'summary' );

You can tell it wasn't made with a high budget, but everything is so detailed and original. The scenery varies greatly: there's a Candy Mountain, an underwater city, a fire city, a dark museum. I love the dark areas the most, they are actually quite creepy! <br><br>I played the earlier version of the game and purchased it immediately when I found out a new version was coming to Steam. The face graphics are completely new (I love them!), the dialogue has been re-written, the whole game feels more polished now.<br><br>The only downside to the game is that the beginning is a little bit slow, but it also allows you to sit back and take in the atmosphere and relax. Then later when more main characters are introduced the pace increases and battles become very strategic and exciting. The whole game feels like a build-up to the amazing climax (small spoiler: there's a huge battle on a sky scraper), but there are also a lot of interesting side-plots that get resolved.<br><br>What I love the most about the game is the symbolism. The whole game takes place inside the main character's &quot;dream world&quot; and everything there (even the quests!) are symbolic of a part of her personality, past and a part of human nature. The parent-child relationship is also an important theme that is explored throughout the game. At the beginning Melrose, the main character, seems a bit bratty and snotty but through her dream world the subject goes a lot deeper and you see her transition into a better person.<br><br>Concluding, I would definitely recommend this game! I'm going back to playing it again. :D Love that I can choose Summoner on first playthrough this time!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12942044', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12942044' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12942044\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12942044' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12942044\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12942044', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12942044_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12942044_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13185665\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lewisx7x\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"145784204\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50e5a93a5caaa3f106cdc0112586a87b14f11a5d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50e5a93a5caaa3f106cdc0112586a87b14f11a5d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50e5a93a5caaa3f106cdc0112586a87b14f11a5d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lewisx7x\/\" data-miniprofile=\"145784204\">lewisx7x<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lewisx7x\/games\/?tab=all\">92 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lewisx7x\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lewisx7x\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 1, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a standard turn-based RPG.  It looks like an old SNES RPG.  Story wise its pretty average and alot of the dialog is awkward at times.  The music is great, there are alot of stand out tunes that feel like they came from the glory days of RPG gaming.  The battle system utilizes the same mechanics as the Final Fantasy ATB.  Nothing groundbreaking here, but if you enjoy RPGs, this game wont let you down.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13185665', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13185665' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13185665\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13185665' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13185665\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13185665', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13185665_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13185665_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16845115\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036275457\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"76009729\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dd\/dd87b004f1c5f24c4ddc75c0f7cce8e394579d1a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dd\/dd87b004f1c5f24c4ddc75c0f7cce8e394579d1a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dd\/dd87b004f1c5f24c4ddc75c0f7cce8e394579d1a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036275457\/\" data-miniprofile=\"76009729\">Myurian<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036275457\/games\/?tab=all\">113 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036275457\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036275457\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 2, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGot to the Love Engine Dungeon... Did a puzzle requiring stepping on some star shaped tile on the ground and then pressed 1 to 5 to make a path for myself to a switch and a skill point. Once i got the skill point i leveled a skill and saved without realising that saving there would reset the puzzle trapping me forever with the switch on the other side. Since i saved with the puzzle reseted when i load i still am trapped since the puzzle reset without bringing me back to the puzzle entrance and there is no way to teleport out of a dungeon... <br>This is a great game and i came across no other bug. I'll have to restart it from the beggining now but i do hope they will fix puzzle reseting when you save for no reason and often trapping you forever unless you made many save file and are able to reload before you got to the said puzzle.

You can't expect triple A quality here, but what you will find is a love-letter to RPGs of the old days.<br><br>The Good:<br>- Graphics are top notch and have a lot of personality<br>- Great environments, with a lot to explore<br>- Well balanced (as of version 1.08) with enough challenge<br>- Several music tracks<br>- The world with interesting lore<br><br>The Bad<br>- The story means well but is a bit messy. All over the place at times. Could've used a bit more focus.<br>- The dialogues are of average quality. It's really hard to write compelling dialogue. So, with that in mind, the game still holds up pretty well.<br>- Some strange bugs like selecting &quot;fast&quot; for battle speed makes the battles slower and selecting &quot;slow&quot; makes the battles faster (try it!) or being able to walk on place where you shouldn't be able to walk. (even on the final beach this happens).<br><br>Overall I would recommend this game to players who really like 16-bit RPGs. This is not Final Fantasy VI quality, but there is enough to like here.

Very nice melodies that bring the game to life.<br><br>The artwork is very nice. In fact, each design invokes emotion. The Portal Demon actually scared me when I first played the game off the creator's site and Candy Mountain is one of my favorite areas aside from the sadly memory wiped Fureta Jungle (it actually looks like it is falling apart and &quot;shutting down&quot;, adding to the emotions embeded in the situation). <br><br>I honestly don't see anything to complain about in terms of the characters. Hellana is cute. Diamond is bravey. Christina is snarky. And Melrose is complex. I can actually relate a bit to Melrose as I have been severely bullied myself throughout my entire school career and I can easily sympathize with her on that note.<br><br>EDIT (AFTER FINISHING):<br><br>As for actual game play, this is very good. The ending was sad and funny at the sametime. Watching Melrose in the real world fall to her death on the left nearly made me cry and the happiness in the Dream World on the right was very uplifting. The two meshed well and kept me from bawling my eyes out for the whole house to hear. <br><br>The storyline is still very good. Sure finding all of the ingredients for the good armor was tedious but well worth it. I still highly recomend this game. I am currently on the Plus Story now and still enjoying the music and art. Also, the Virginitphosbius (how ever you spell the third form of Farah that was once called Agraphobius) is easily the most distrubing, scary looking monster in the game. It beats the portal demon, hands down in design and representation. <br><br>That's another thing, all the phobius represent a specific fear. Arachinphobius represents the fear of spiders while Agraphobius represents the fear of sexual abuse. Very clever there Rose Portal Games. It definitely show that they know quite a bit about pshycology.

Have not completed all sidequests. Have not started New Journey+ at the time of writing this review. <br><br>Potential spoilers in my review.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Good artwork and animation<br>- Good combat mechanics for an RPG<br>- Hard to recognize it as an RPG Maker game aside from the stock sounds and effects it provided.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- Normal battles get too long, tedious, and repetitive at the later part of the game. I found myself actively trying to get rid of these enemies as fast as possible, as they constantly come around repeatedly, and it gets boring after a while.<br>- Very easy to get lost sometimes. A main storyline quest is a bit vague.<br>- Sometimes the plot can get a bit dull at times, but there's plenty of good stuff in between.<br>- Could use a bit more portals for fast travel mechanics.<br>- Noticeable bugs. Avoidable, but noticeable.<br><br>Bug 1: Before fighting Lisetrix, you are offered a chance to save the game as well as heal up, as it brings up the menu. If you go to the &quot;New Skills&quot; area while at this point, you will be taken to the fight WHILE in the skill selection area. Results in you fighting Lisetrix in what looks to be a simple, beta fighting background, while the skillpoints are still visible. Not sure what happens if you defeat her as I didn't kill her the first time, but I imagine it might result in something gamebreaking, knowing RPG Maker.<br><br>Bug 2: At the volcano, there is a simple jumping puzzle that you have to leap through. It's possible to wound up jumping into the lava, and end up getting stuck in it if you take a certain path.<br><br><br>Overall, this is a game that took some excellent advantage of RPG Maker's mechanics. One of a kind.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17512838', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17512838' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short17512838\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17512838' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short17512838\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17512838', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short17512838_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short17512838_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short17441359\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jpsf91\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"230114815\">jpsf91<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 74.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 8, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is an old-school RPG Maker game, for better and worse. The game has a good story, a lot of areas to explore, find chests for items and equipment, fight enemies with solid combat, skill trees, crafting, many side-quests and a great soundtrack. Although all these elements are good for themselves, the biggest problem with this game it's the pacing: you'll have to backtrack a lot and fighting the same enemies over and over gets saturated. The 1.08 patch helps to skip random encounters, but you'll still need to gain EXP to be able to progress. And the side-quests are generic: talk to NPC, go there and there (more backtrack), complete task, and return for reward. But if you can overlook these issues, i think that this is an enjoyable game. The characters are likable and the story gripping, besides the pacing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17441359', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17441359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short17441359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17441359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short17441359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17441359', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short17441359_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short17441359_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short16923699\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/VampiricsLove\/recommended\/326730\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"50341252\">Heavenly Kitten<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 66.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 7, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhisper of the Rose is a slightly more mature version of Sweet Lily Dreams (also done by Rose Portal Games). The story revolves around Melrose who is in a harsh relationship with her (supposed) parents and rough school life. She thrives in happiness through her dreams and imagination. This ends up leading her to steal a device that allows one person to enter a dream world that may or may not be better for them.<br><br>The story is common among many people and may even connect with those who might be in a similar state (or were). The game play is a little different than SLD, but is still an RPG Maker Game with simple RPG elements. The game has some great music and you can even get through it with little grinding if you are decent with these kinds of games. The variety of sidequests also help to make the game a little more interesting when you start getting tired of the main story events.<br><br>Some of the game's plot can be a little too dull and may lead some people to give up early, but it ramps up the further you get into the game, making most people wanting to continue. The Skill Tree almost seems like a real tree. It has giant branches and is not the easiest to navigate, but once you get use to it, it is not that problematic. There is not a large variety of enemies, but each enemy  has different weaknesses no matter what type it is.<br><br>There are other good ideas and bad moments in this game, but I will not spoil too much to give anyone interested in the game a chance to experience the game for themselves. There is a free guide online if you ever get lost or need some kind of help and exploration is always recommended. You may find things that you didn't know you could get early on that will help with your game play. All in All, the game is decent for an RPG Maker game and is definetly worth trying.<br><br>7.2\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16923699', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16923699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short16923699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16923699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short16923699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16923699', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short16923699_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short16923699_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/326730\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 67 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["13133468","12947735","12977119","12964931","17219070","22131522","12942044","13185665","16845115","19317780"]}
