If you're not familiar with Isaac, it's essentially a strange hybrid of a roguelike and a multi-directional shoot-em-up (shmup). So, how does TSGO (as I'll be referring to it) compare?<br><br>Well, it tries, I'll give it that. Drawing comparisons to Isaac is quite easy, but I'll try not to do that for now. To start with, TSGO bills itself as a randomly generated hack \u2018n\u2019 slash adventure game with rogue-like elements. <br><br>All of this is fairly true, especially the bit about hacking and slashing. It's pretty fun initially to explore and defeat enemies throughout the randomly-generated rooms the game provides you. The game differentiates itself from similar games by having players slash enemies in a direction around them, as opposed to shooting projectiles of some kind. However, by visiting the shop between levels or by finding items, players can increase the range of their attacks. So, what about the rest of that sentence I mentioned a while ago?<br><br>Well....here's where things get a bit dicey. See, TSGO <i>is<\/i> randomly-generated to an extent, but the variety in environments, items, enemies, and secrets is pretty lacking to be honest. Sure, the game will place rocks and trees in different spaces for each room, but who cares really? The environments are the same 5 levels which is fine, but they could use some more variety in their theming. They're pretty basic as is - a desert, some snowy place, a dark &quot;spooky&quot; area, etc. I'd love to see more vibrant and creative ideas for environments, but the game just settles for the most basic of concepts. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier both the items and enemies aren't particularly interesting. The enemies have unique attack patterns which is nice, but they're constantly the same and I'd be interested in seeing some variety in them. Why not have different colored enemies with various attributes (stronger, slower, faster, etc.)? The items aren't much better either, as while some of them have neat uses, such as a hat that lets the player teleport, most are fairly uninteresting or just give a small stat boost. Oh, also there's secrets....but only a few, and they're not very cool or useful, besides the puzzles that unlock characters. Those are neat I will admit.<br><br>So, onto the bit about the game being an adventure game with rogue-like elements. Sure, it exemplifies some of the elements that are commonly found in the genre, like permadeath, various items, or whatnot, but the problem with The Story Goes On is that it just isn't difficult for someone of moderate gaming skill. Personally, I initially died 4 or so times and then &quot;beat&quot; (or rather, beat the 5 levels currently in the game) the game an additional 5 times after that. I didn't die at all between those 5 runs, and while I was initially amazed at my supposed skill with the game, I began to realize that it just wasn't challenging at all. The bosses (which by the way, are fairly creative in comparison to the enemies) are easy, the enemies are easy once you learn their attack patterns, and overall the game is just a walk in the park after an hour or two of playing. It didn't take long for me to get bored with TSGO, and that worries me because I enjoyed what I've played of it so far.<br><br>You see, the game is still <i>fun<\/i>. It's challenging initially. The art style is lovely, if a bit unpolished. The potential replay value is there, but the lack of any extended replayability in its current form beyond 5-10 runs or so is worrisome. Partially, this is due to the lack of <i>stuff<\/i> currently in the game, like levels, items, or enemies, but this is also because the game is just too easy in its current state. Now, however, the game is in Early Access, and while usually this is a curse for any interested potential customer on Steam, I can safely say that the developers are some of the most genuine and caring ones out there. They're all over the forums for the game, and they actively seek out community suggestions and any bug reports. Patches are constantly released for TSGO, and that's great! I love that the developers truly do care, and that's what convinced me to raise my recommendation from a no to a yes,<br><br>The game is fun as is, but it's definitely lacking in some areas. The developers seem to truly care about remedying the issues with the game though, and I appreciate that. They're constantly adding new content, such as enemies, items, bosses, or entire levels, in addition to fixing bugs all the time and taking in community suggestions or comments. This to me speaks miles compared to other Early Access developers who just put out a patch every 6 months or so. The commitment put into The Story Goes On makes me hopeful that the game will be pretty good, if not amazing eventually. In its current state though? Well, it's a bit rough around the edges, but if you're a fan of the genre or just looking to try out a new, cheap game, this isn't a bad option.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19263249', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19263249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19263249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19263249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19263249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19263249', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19263249_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19263249_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19139619\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"202025019\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/\" data-miniprofile=\"202025019\">Tawny Lawns \ud83d\udc97<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/games\/?tab=all\">3,493 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/recommended\/369560\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">22.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Story Goes On was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Due to an undying love for arcade, indie, dungeon crawlers and HnS games I unashamedly asked the dev for a key so I could try this game out and review it. Nobody was hurt in the process. But here's <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/100pAG\/discussions\/1\/496880503064257496\/#c496881136898978223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >the thread<\/a> so you know.<\/b><br><br>Check TL;DR at bottom of review if this is too long for you.<br><br>The past few days have been spent milling around inside this squeaky clean indie game with a handful of baddies and critters, all of us sort of gliding from dungeon to dungeon in a place deemed a maze and called by the rather grandiose name of, The Odyssey. Having realised there must be some sort of lore, it felt essential to plop on my deerstalker cap and produce some yummy Googley searches. The results were thankfully plump lore of where we are introduced to our main protagonist, seven year old Aidan. Of our four diversly skilled characters (three of which you unlock through hidden puzzles), Aidan is the one you're stuck with in the beginning. A trifle &quot;young&quot; for my taste, I only played him a few times before moving onto my favourite and more recent addition to the team, Gambit the Void Slayer <i>(flailing his ninja arms back in true Naruto fashion will confuse your sense of direction in the beginning, plenty of in-game references to many other delightful characters like this)<\/i>. But more on that later since the story goes on (couldn't resist the chance pun). On one fateful night Aidan's brother tells Aidan the tale of their grandfather, a man whose thirst for hidden riches takes him to a mystical place called the Odyssey where it is said treasure buried deep in the dungeon awaits those brave enough to search for it. It is a treacherous maze of the Scar, a gang of thieves operating under a dark leader Staz. Thirty years passed and to this day nobody knows what happened to their grandfather, seemingly lost forever in the depths of this strange world. In hindsight the current EA version of this game at the time of writing this review doesn't implement this lore much and stays bromidic in-game. Where there is a story if you want it, it doesn't suffice as a form of narrative within the game itself. Players <i>are<\/i> greeted by the trusty shopkeeper, Bob who offers hints and helpful in-game factoids to ease any progression difficulties for the newbie or aid unlocking secrets. This lessens the feeling of emptyness of hearing your own voice echo against the walls of the maze. <br><br>First of its developer, this rougelike has been hauled a terrifically long way from the start of its development. Even with the art and music there are videos of how it looked <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ALEWpdv5Gy0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >before<\/a>, the stark contrast hails the constant work the devs are putting in and it was a shame I couldn't find even earlier versions to form a timeline for it. It's wondrous and quite remarkable to be able to see a game progress within a sturdy community of gamers, and even as sorely overused wording, the term &quot;community made&quot; most certainly finds its proper use here as an indie title. Even as a person who hasn't had one awful experience with an EA title purchased before release (which is very rare) I understand and purchase these kinds of games with full knowledge that EA is a blind leap of faith however much content seems to be there or not. Yet this is still an early access game so that is what you get and the current price isn't too shabby at all. <br><br>With five levels so far (different theme for each world, very detailed for a first timer's indie offspring) it is difficult to call it a complete experience even though I gave it my all with repeated playthroughs totalling 15+ hours. The current game does not give you over fifteen hours of playtime. It gives you a couple of hours at the most. I spent a long time looking for secrets and mostly going through variations to unlock a certain character that seemed to be bugged so couldn't be found anyway (will probably be fixed soon). There are several secret hidden caves and dimensions to uncover using from the most obvious to the oddest methods. The biggest fun in this game was looking for the aforementioned locations, trying out all the characters you can unlock and unlocking them in the first place. Many of these increase in goodness when you use the guiding hand of achievements if you are interested in those at all. Characters can respectively throw roped hooks, dash, ninja leap around, place bombs and detonate them with good old sword swinging and teleport among other feats. Specific character introductions will be spared since getting to meet each of the characters adds to the lore of the game and should be experienced first-hand by the player. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">It plays like Larva Mortus with a face lift and a brain<\/div>One of the first games I knowingly completed 100% achievements for on Steam was Larva Mortus. As a person who enjoys arcadey games that make you grind until your bum is sore, it was a happy experience that I never really got again since most games that simple tend to crash and burn because it cannot keep your attention long enough to be completed. <b>The moment I booted up The Story Goes On, it reminded me of a new age Larva Mortus tripping on mushrooms.<\/b> Indeed there are trippy items in this game such as the mushroom (JUST EAT IT...) and the technicoloured unicorn item that made me dash back and forth like a loopy person watching my rear end fart rainbow coloured dreams (that crush all bad guys crossing its path <b>*insert diabolical fingertip tapping here*<\/b>). Moving past the simplicity of hack and slash, there are many other things I enjoy about this game. The primary school style of colourful graphics that made me daydream about it becoming cut-out animated game with dimension (gameplay and visuals are very Zelda), satisfyingly fun sound effects (I got addicted to a certain &quot;whip whoosh&quot;) as well as the secrets which push you to check everything you can karate chop with your weapon but not to the extent of dungeon crawlers that waste hours of your time pushing every stone on the wall. Plainly stated I had a lot of fun. But only after enduring about an hour of the actual game. It's currently short and I completed the game a few times but during that inital first hour I was worried about what I was going to write because it seemed boring. I was hacking and slashing in a game without an actual true ending as of yet (early access review), and without the end I felt lost. This will go away once the game actually reaches its finale with the narrative but the stable mechanics are smooth sailing and the relatively attentive developers are clearly working on this game with weekly updates where change is incontestably evident as you boot it up one week and then the next to compare. <br><br><b>Conclusion<\/b><br>It isn't all fun and games with bottles of Whey. If progression is your only joy in gaming this may not be the title for you (while in EA) since you can beat it in less than thirty minutes on your first try and move on from its current early five stage state. Difficulty isn't much of a problem and as basically everything is randomly generated you're not going through exactly the same sequence but as the game updates, currently the lack of difficulty is getting replaced more and more by tediousness. Some bosses are tedious to fight rather than difficult (most are plain easy), which is fine and a frequent factor in HnS games but it will not suit a lot of people who just want to be entertained right off the bat. The art looks like a children's pop-up book with fluffy stickers and scratch &amp; sniff, but it is detailed and keeps growing into what I expect will probably be one adorable HnS adventure for Aidan and his friends. <br><br><b>TL;DR -<\/b> <br>Only recommended if you: want to see an EA game grow, find HnS\/dungeon crawlers or shumps like Larva Mortus fun, find repetition soothing and\/or enjoy supporting small indies.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19139619', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19139619' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19139619\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19139619' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19139619\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19139619', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19139619_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19139619_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17216281\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MartyrA2J\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"99296163\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6822b6d1d42ac1e1ac7b9b6971c1f5d2e8a38b1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6822b6d1d42ac1e1ac7b9b6971c1f5d2e8a38b1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6822b6d1d42ac1e1ac7b9b6971c1f5d2e8a38b1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MartyrA2J\/\" data-miniprofile=\"99296163\">MartyrA2J<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MartyrA2J\/games\/?tab=all\">712 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MartyrA2J\/recommended\/\">388 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MartyrA2J\/recommended\/369560\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Story Goes On was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Disclaimer- This preview was written during Early Access. The Story Goes On is subject to change.-<br><br>On first glance The Story Goes On is a game you might pass up, the graphics are not flashy, nothing spectacularly here to catch your eye and draw you in. On second glance, if you dig a little deeper you might find a challenging and enjoyable title, especially if you're a fan of roguelikes. The Story Goes On is a Hack &amp; Slash, RPG, Roguelike, with randomized dungeons in the form of the Odyssey and perma-death. The title draws some obvious comparisons to the much beloved and revered gran-daddy of roguelikes, Binding of Isaac. The key difference of The Story Goes On being is that instead of poop demons and tears, we have some good old fashioned swords and magic. If I had to put The Story Goes On in a nutshell it would be a great game to introduce somebody younger or new to the roguelike genre. It has friendly, albeit simple, visuals and for the most part is simple to grasp and play.<br><br>The gameplay is rather simple and along the lines of other roguelike titles such as A Wizards Lizard or The Weaponographist. You travel from square rooms to rectangle rooms slaughtering indiscriminately in search of loot, keys, and the boss key. There are all sorts of random powers and buffs that alter your characters basic statistics like range, dash, and weapon speed. The powers or loot can range from a mace you throw at enemies, a trusty parrot that pecks at foes, to a ice wand with limited charges. These items\/buffs are all randomly placed including enemies, secrets, and randomized bosses.<br><br>The combat is the main draw here in The Story Goes On, and for the most part it works just fine. You mindlessly left click on your mouse until your enemies go poof and the rooms exits appear. Depending on which character you are using you will have some basic abilities. The main character you start with has a dash that makes him invulnerable, a hookshot, and his sword. I couldn't comment on the other characters as I had no indicator or hint whatsoever on how to unlock them. I can only assume it was by completing the first five sections of the game. Which I did not manage due to my issues with the combat.<br><br>Like I said, the combat works for the most part and is acceptable and challenging at times, yet there is polish that needs to happen. As an example entering a room sometimes instantly rewards you with damage as enemies spawn on top of you, also the enemies have very strange attack animations that makes it hard to predict when they are going to strike. This lead to my death more then once and left me feeling cheated at times, this on top of the fact it's a perma-death game, as you can imagine, was very frustrating. The main hero's abilities of hookshot and dash, seemingly got me into more trouble then they were worth, hacking away was far more easy and safer. The game currently doesn't really reward you for trying different tactics. Finally the enemies seemingly died from random amounts of damage, one would die from a single swipe and others in two or three swipes. This could be due to buffs and stats changing although this randomness continued in most of my game sessions.<br><br>After clearing many rooms and finding the boss key, you will face off against one of the games bosses. These are seemingly randomized but currently there are only about two maybe three per area. This is by far the area that needs the most balancing, as bosses are simply laughable and easy to defeat. Most of the time I felt the bosses were not even attacking me. I had more trouble with some of the mini-bosses that appear randomly while exploring the Odyssey. Speaking of the Odyssey, it was rather an enjoyable experience. The five sections of the game are rather unique in feel and design, despite the fact the game is completely in 4:3 resolution and doesn't support widescreen. You can put the game on fullscreen but end up with giant black bars on the side of your screen. Most of the problems with combat and UI design, I can forgive due to the game being in Early Access. Despite this, I just don't understand why the game doesn't support widescreen in this day and age.<br><br>Nonetheless, each of the areas does have a very unique tone, with monsters coming at you from all sides that suit the area and making each area feel unique. The areas come in different sizes and even contain some hazards that you must watch out for as you battle an onslaught of monsters. This I liked very much as it kept me on my toes. There are also some secrets littered about the game that can be discovered by hacking at everything, usually rewarding you with some sort of stat buff. This is again par for the course in roguelikes and works very well, rewarding exploration.<br><br>The game is surprisingly well put together for an Early Access title.(Former experiences with other EA games left me wanting) The base game right now is for the most part bug free and I never had any kind of hiccups. The UI is acceptable but does have the tiny issue of where the map that shows the Odyssey is placed. This map can cover up a portion of the map and hence an enemy might be hiding out of your sight. This is something that will hopefully be addressed by the time the game exits Early Access.  <br><br>Other areas need polish as well, including story, which The Story Goes On doesn't currently have ironically. The music I found was quite enjoyable and one of the areas I felt the game was nicely done, using a mix of fast paced electronica and old style chip tunes. The sound effects were acceptable as well, slashing, explosions, and magic all had a nice oomph to them and never grated on my ears. The enemies did fall quite silent though as all they did was go poof.<br><br>Speaking to the other accoutrements, such as options, I was not disappointed, offering motion blur, lighting effects, and fully rebindable keys. Replay value of the game is high of course as the dungeons are randomized, random items, and unlocking other characters. The overall games length lends itself to quick playthroughs lasting anywhere from 20 to 40 mins.<br><br>The game is fun and just difficult enough for newer and veteran players, at least for the first couple of playthroughs. I think eventually veterans will find the game a bit on the easy side. I can see myself playing the game a couple of times until all the characters are unlocked, however there really isn't anything I felt to keep the player locked into this game. There are some neat ideas here that need to polished but nothing that is really all that original. This could all be due to the game still being in Early Access, as more features and items make it into the game and add their own unique flair and keep me wanting to play more and more. It should also be noted that the game does come at an incredibly great price of $4.99, that price alone makes this game worth it. Like I mentioned, The Story Goes On a great way to introduce your friends or kids to roguelikes.<br><br>So if you are in the market for new and up coming roguelike that you can play with your kids and not worry about religious overtones(coughBindingofIsaaccough).

Everything down below I've written from a non-biased, early-access perspective and will remain unchanged.<\/b><br><br>If you like top-down hack'n'slash type games such as the original Zelda games or random maze generated gameplay like in the Binding of Isaac, then this may tickle your fancy.  The Story Goes on [Although Currently in Early Access] is a fun-fast paced game with hidden secrets and unique items.  <br>The gameplay goes very quickly and dying is something I may call a feature to the game: it works like losing lives, but as a throwback to old retro Atari\/NES era games, you start from the beginning upon game over.  This however doesn't depreciate gameplay in the slightest since the levels only get progressively harder and getting back to where you died takes mere minutes.<br>Regardless of that apparent length, purchasing the game will have you playing it for countless hours (I've already racked up a dozen myself in the last week)!  Bugs do come up from time to time, but as an early access game this comes to be expected and I can't really say any have made the game unplayable.  The few bugs there are have come and gone very quickly since the team provides updates almost daily.<br>Perhaps one of my favorite features about this game is that it's community-driven and community-made.  No, an entire community is not coding the game, but there are forum threads based in game discussion and Google Docs for players to post bug reports, recommendations, suggestions and sometimes supply their own art assets for the game.  The team creating The Story Goes On isn't working alone, and this is one of few Early Access games I feel I actual contribute to in the development process.  In fact, a few achievements, graphical changes and items I suggested have already made it in the game!<br>This game is certainly worth the minor change you need to shell out for it and it's one that you can pick up whenever you want; no save points, no getting stuck on a hard boss(bosses that spawn are completely random).<br>You'll never experience the same maze\/dungeon twice!<br>I'd give this game 7 lemons out of 2 rotten grapefruits.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16313806', 'summary' );

Needs more variety.<br><br>Levels: The overall size of each level is rather small and there's only a few areas until you reach the end of the story (for now). There needs to either be larger levels, or a lot more levels. There are more than enough bosses to create more levels if needed.<br><br>Overall: Game definitely has potential and is fun the more you play; however, that's only a good start.

The basic enemy units are predictable and the game becomes more about trying to find powerups and secret hidden items.  <br><br>The bosses do have individual strategies that you learn on the fly to dodge their abilities.  <br><br>This game can be very short, but its great for those short bursts of time where you might only have 5-10 minutes to play.  You can beat a level or two and save at the shop.<br><br>Its very very important to save at the shop inbetween levels otherwise you might play for awhile and forget to save and have to start over again.  <br><br>Through more time spent in the game you'll acrew more powerups and even unlock some new characters so even small bits of time spent in the game will add up to good progress.<br><br>I enjoyed this game and I think for the casual to moderate gamer they would enjoy this game if they had limited time available to play.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19169218', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19169218' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19169218\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19169218' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19169218\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19169218', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19169218_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19169218_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16320384\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/salmon4desire\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"70702726\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4c\/4caf64a5320bc3fa2ceec38a9c8327bb38642ffc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4c\/4caf64a5320bc3fa2ceec38a9c8327bb38642ffc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4c\/4caf64a5320bc3fa2ceec38a9c8327bb38642ffc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/salmon4desire\/\" data-miniprofile=\"70702726\">Salmon the Assistor<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/salmon4desire\/games\/?tab=all\">290 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/salmon4desire\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/salmon4desire\/recommended\/369560\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Story Goes On was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI happened upon &quot;The Story Goes On&quot; whislt I was browsing through the r\/gamedesign subreddit.

This game merges beautifully the dungeon crawling experience I have so assiduously obtained from a &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; title, and the rogue-like arcade aspect I have cherished from a plethora of games.

This game, in my opinion, is a pretty great Binding of Isaac clone. I wouldn't be fooled by the bland combat at the beginning, soon you will unlock powerups and weapons, or just continually upgrade the speed of your weapon. There are pets yopu can unlock, which when you reach a certain amount they then fuse together to make a really strong pet. There's also a selection of characters to unlock, all offering a new mix to the game.<br>This game is in no way AS good as Binding of Isaac, but I still had a lot of fun with it and would recommend it for a few hours of fun.

It's grown at an amazing rate and for an indie game made by 3 college kids, it's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing. It's a hack n' slash game but it still remains very entertaining and relaxed. I love playing this game while listening to my music. It's a really chill and entertaining game and I definately recommend it. Totally worth the price!<br><br>MORE TECHNICAL<br><br>The game runs really well, you could play this on any computer really. The game mechanics are great, the design is amazing. There are a couple upcoming bugs but they usually get fixed in updates very quickly. Malcolm and his friends are doing Early Access right, with the game getting progressively better due to bug fixes and game updates every couple weeks. This game is very well crafted. If you are a fan of Binding of Issac or Hyperlight Drifter you will most likely enjoy this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something new to play. :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23109442', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23109442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23109442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23109442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23109442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23109442', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23109442_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23109442_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short23092225\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198086747602\/recommended\/369560\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"126481874\">Heebie LF Doubles Partner<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Story Goes On was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is actually loads of fun, in spite of it not yet having a full release.

The price is good, and gameplay\/ mechanics work well. Of the powerups ive found they have been pretty unique and creative. One ive found really cool removes your 'hearts' and instead taken damage depletes your money stock, so running out of money will kill you! <br><br>From the time I've played so far I have come across two glitches\/bugs that ruined my run.<br>One after beating a boss I went into the blackhole, but it seemed like under the hole was a cactus or something that killed me.<br>And the other bug being at the sun boss, I seemed to have broke his little sun he throws and I couldnt damage the boss at all. Though both of these issues have only happened once each, they will surely be reviewed and amended in the future.<br><br>The only improvement I would like to see is with the minimap. I find it to distracting not being able to see where i am in the rooms, but instead have to look at a string line on the minimap following my path.<br><br>All in all I am pretty curious to see what else this game can bring\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22209570', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22209570' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22209570\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22209570' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22209570\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22209570', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22209570_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22209570_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22012889\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010347489\/recommended\/369560\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"50081761\">porcoddio a pedali<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while The Story Goes On was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlovee this game, is very nice\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22012889', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22012889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22012889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22012889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22012889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22012889', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22012889_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22012889_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/369560\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 84 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["19263249","19139619","17216281","16316747","16313806","19348666","16309891","16308715","19169218","16320384"]}
