You'll start off weak and grow more powerful with every upgrade including more health, more energy, long range attacks, etc.  Enemies and bosses have tactics and weaknesses that you learn and exploit.  There's not really much of a story to the game, you're there to assassinate the baddie, that's pretty much it.  Characters aren't really explored and are cliche for the most part.  Expect the dialogue to be not so good.  Game is pretty much constant action\/exploration which makes it enjoyable.<br><br>The game does have several issues.  The biggest is probably the wall grapple controls.  You can attach to almost every wall\/ceiling in the game and move around.  Getting off of these can be problematic at times.  You'll press the jump button to detach and instead he'll keep on hanging there.  The game automatically moves you up platforms if you get to the edge of them instead of waiting for a prompt from you to do so.  This can get annoying at times if you're trying to get close to the edge of a platform without wanting to go up on it.<br><br>The second problem is that the difficulty is inconsistent.  I played on hard and while I found the very beginning to be sufficiently difficult, it got easier from there, especially once you get the first 2-3 health upgrades pretty quickly.  Some areas are overabundant in health pickups &amp; killing enemies gives you a little health back as well.  Save points recover all missing health.  There's occasionally an area or two where the difficulty spikes for a little, but not too often.  Once you learn the basics of enemies, they'll usually give you little problems.   Later on, you can usually just run by enemies and mostly ignore them.  Bosses also suffer from the same problem.  There're 2-3 that are pretty tough and will probably kill you a time or two until you learn from your mistakes and win, but others are incomprehensibly easy.  The Pooh Sisters will barely put up a struggle and will probably only take down a fraction of your health before you slaughter them.  I beat both the final boss and his alternate form without dying once, and I arrived at the final boss with only about 40% of my total health.<br><br>The game can get a touch repetitive as you'll be fighting most of the same enemies throughout with occasional palette swaps which grant them different health\/damage\/special abilities\/weaknesses\/etc.  Would've been nice to have more enemy variety, though enemies do use different weaponry (Rifles, Snipers, Shotguns, Rockets, Machine guns, etc) which do make fights feel different.<br><br>You don't unlock the quick travel points until about 60-70% of the way through the game and the most that any one area will have is 1.  Some areas don't have any.  This can make backtracking for upgrades\/pickups a little annoying later on when you've got all the special abilities.  Especially since some areas are relatively sizable and could take 5+ minutes to run through.  Most 'essential' stuff is usually somewhere close by where you find a new special ability.  It's usually only the unlockable art\/intel\/character info that are far off somewhere, so it'll only be really annoying for people trying to 100% the game.<br><br>Graphics are fine, music is hit and miss but is decent enough for the most part.  Didn't run into any bugs\/crashes at any point.  Most of the games problems are minor points, though I would have really liked the game to be much more challenging, especially the bosses.  It's a solid entertaining game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30659026', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30659026' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30659026\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30659026' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30659026\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30659026', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30659026_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30659026_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30877161\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979948340\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"19682612\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6789e4a4513475bfa35a529c2aa9f56191562b3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6789e4a4513475bfa35a529c2aa9f56191562b3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d6\/d6789e4a4513475bfa35a529c2aa9f56191562b3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979948340\/\" data-miniprofile=\"19682612\">Capt.sweaty<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979948340\/games\/?tab=all\">187 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979948340\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979948340\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat an amazing recreation.

Controls are tight and smooth, levels are laid out in that great metroidvania style of peeling back layers as you upgrade your abilities, and boss battles are unique and challenging experiences. I've been replaying this recently because my 8yr old son restarted my progress (wish you could make multiple profiles ;) and I'm still enjoying it.

But the effort gone into all the lighting effects really shows and adds a lot to the detail level imo. Love the scarf being used as a dynamic light source. Didn't skip a beat fps wise and overall it's just a joy to play. The entire world is lovely, as is the accompanying soundtrack. Supports 1440p+ and 120hz+ setups which I was impressed with given capcoms history.<br><br>Game contains one giant world but it has reasonably intelligent level design, backtracking to unlock new areas with moves that were not accessible before and such. Guessing at the length it should last  around 6-10hrs. Maybe more if into collectables and higher difficulty modes. Tight controls with a decent combo system that should keep expanding for a while. <br><br>If you're a fan of Strider or metroidvania styled games in general, at this pricepoint it's a must buy imo. Immersive and enjoyable experience so far that fans should not be dissapointed with.

The game is fluid and fast.  The game plays like the Marvel vs Capcom series but with less emphasis on combos and a barrage of enemies to mutilate.  It is the type of game that makes you wonder why it took so long to come out.  It plays like Ninja Gaiden but with every game element taken to it's limit.  <br><br>You can climb ANYWHERE, secrets are EVERYWHERE, and robotic thugs aim to punish you.  Enemies come in both the cloned and overly personalized varieties.  The bright flash of colors and the effects are as intense as a psychodelic experience at times.  It feel's like a playable anime and it never givse you a moment to rest those button mashing fingers.  Intense and hardcore as they get.  <br><br>Buy this now, you will not regret it, <br>and thank you capcom for this wonderful experience!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9190121', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9190121' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9190121\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9190121' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9190121\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9190121', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9190121_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9190121_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t96 of 115 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18481240\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStrider is a reinterpretation of Capcom\u2019s 1989 arcade platformer classic of the same name. Reboots are always tricky, particularly reboots of a certain age. How much should a developer pander to the existing fanbase? And how should they entertain newcomers? Off the back of the largely successful Killer Instinct reimagining in 2013 for Xbox One, developer Double Helix Games had its work cut out for it when making 2014\u2019s Strider.<br><br>It\u2019s not entirely clear where game developers drew their inspiration from in the 1980s. Looking back at Capcom\u2019s original Strider, it\u2019s all somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Aldous Huxley\u2019s darkly satiric A Brave New World, with its looming dictator state, pseudo futuristic flying machines, and lone protagonist forced into rebellion. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was great fun, but like many of its 80s peers - Space Harrier and Altered Beast, prime examples - it was also a bit mad: level progression was jarring, and it was never really clear what was actually going on. What\u2019s clear now is that 2014\u2019s reimagining of Strider adds a little more cohesion to the old story, whilst compromising very little of the good stuff. <br><br>With what appears to be a less than subtle point to prove, the new Strider hits the ground running, all guns blazing, firing on all cylinders, and whatever other relevant speed\/capacity related cliche you can think of. It\u2019s fast yet at the same time entirely cool, striking an almost perfect balance for the most part. Immediately following a familiar hand glider descent into Grandmaster Meio\u2019s robot-policed Socialist republic Kazakh City, frontman Strider Hiryu wastes no time in relaying his reasons to player and enemy alike: he\u2019s a cyber ninja and he\u2019s here to kill. A flash of his Cypher sword immediately leaves a pair of automaton foes sprawled out on the concourse, but before their short-circuiting innards hit the floor, our hero has cartwheeled onto the next duo, executing the same lightening speed maneuver to devastating effect. And so Strider sets the pace which it manages to maintain almost from start to finish, doing so whilst retaining the vigor and swagger and red scarf-flailing of the protagonist\u2019s quarter of a century-old predecessor. Best of all - it looks and feels brilliant. <br><br>Much similar to his older brother, Strider Hyru is capable of such enemy trouncing acrobatics in concert with a wide range of skills. The only difference this time round is that the ninja\u2019s skill-set must be learned, each individual skill in turn, via the game\u2019s freshly imposed Metroidvania structure; or \u201cgear-gating,\u201d a term which seems to be becoming increasingly popular. At first, Strider\u2019s arsenal is limited, but this is matched by lesser-skilled baddies - largely generic foot soldiers in the opening stages - whereupon enjoying the velocity of the kill is more important than strategy, something which actually never gets old. Health orbs appear in abundance early on too, diminishing only slightly as the game progresses, but with a slew of evenly-spaced checkpoints throughout, back-tracking never really becomes an issue.<br><br>Although reluctant to overuse the slightly lazy term \u2018Metroidvania\u2019 - Strider is a bloody good one. By adopting such a mechanic, not only can powerups like sword-charging be learned - used to cut through shield-bearing foes - but classic stunts such as Hyru\u2019s signature double jump can also be accrued, adding not only a clever layer of depth to the game, but also a certain level of order - something distinctly lacking in the original. As expected in gear-gating games of this nature, each respective boss battle requires deft use of the previously learned skill - my favourites including the ability to deflect bullets ala Metal Gear Solid\u2019s Grey Fox, and manipulating time portals in order to unlock otherwise inaccessible areas - with completion often unlocking the next in turn. This works well on the whole, however there are the odd occasions where confusing layouts, regardless of the HUD map and pointer icon\u2019s input, lead to lengthy misadventures which terminate at superfluous collector\u2019s items, as opposed to the \u2018right way\u2019 - ie the next boss. For a game that relies on - and largely operates in - its fast-action, high-octane sequences, this proves incredibly tedious, placing a needless obstacle between the player and what the game does best. <br><br>Another issue with Strider\u2019s setting is its lack of variety. Although integral to the original, Kazakh City wasn\u2019t the game's lone location, as an Amazonian-style jungle and Arctic-inspired snow land also featured. These zones were initially included in early screenshots of the 2014 edition, however were dropped from its final iteration. This leaves certain areas feeling slightly monotonous - particularly in the latter third of the six hour or so quest- only noticeably switching things up upon entering Meio\u2019s headquarters towards the game\u2019s end. This, however, is best portrayed here by a gravity switching sequence, which will more than satisfy those in search of nostalgia. <br><br>But what Strider lacks in landscape diversity, it makes up for with deft use of camera angles. Although fixed throughout, the way in which the game switches from close to long range with each scene serves to govern the pace of each battle. With interchangeable camerawork akin to the Oddworld series, bouts viewed from distance tend to be drawn-out, planned affairs, wherein the player is afforded the time to pick and choose which enemies to engage with, traversing walls and ceilings with the strider\u2019s automatically activated grapple hooks; whereas closeups regularly become a mash of sweaty, quick-fire button-bashing until everything on screen has stopped moving. <br><br>Boss battled are designed to steal center stage, and often do. Each showdown has a sequence which must be understood and then adhered to and followed in order to match each antagonist. That said, some foes can be outdone by simply seizing space and battering the attack button, racing your health bar against theirs. More often than not, following the correct process works best but can at times becomes frustrating, as the difficulty of each boss is less than predictable. How much of a problem this actually is depends on the player, however I saw this balance of challenge and luck more of an homage to the difficulty of the coin-operated games of yore, of which Strider hails from. <br><br>Strider is unapologetic in its approach: it\u2019s a Metroidvania that thrives on speed, slashing, and general carnage. It manages all four very well. Story-lite it may be, but it never tries to be otherwise, and a host of bosses and enemies such as mechanical crabs, robotic gorillas, and snaking mechanised Chinese dragons, not to mention an army of drones and Strider-sized soldiers all keep the entertainment flowing. Of course the aforementioned cyber mammals, reptiles and arthropods will likely resonate with existing fans; yet the ferocity of these battles will also appeal to newcomers. And that\u2019s why this Strider works as a \u2018remake\u2019 - it clearly is a new game, built from the ground up, but is also laced with sentimentality.<br><br>Bear in mind the original Strider was introduced as a coin-op arcade game, predating the 90s and a fair whack of the modern market, therefore capturing a new audience is something Double Helix has clearly also set out to do. Match this with the Californian outfit\u2019s reimagining of Killer Instinct last year, and it would appear they know what they\u2019re doing when reinterpreting the classics. By adopting a Metroidvania-guise here, rather, gear-gating, Double Helix shows that it can in fact teach an old dog new tricks.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18481240', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18481240' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18481240\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18481240' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18481240\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18481240', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18481240_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18481240_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12724430\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71635444\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02d996c4af6ff20bd4bd2041e92de8d88b427003.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02d996c4af6ff20bd4bd2041e92de8d88b427003.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02d996c4af6ff20bd4bd2041e92de8d88b427003_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71635444\">jIVEsOULbRO<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/games\/?tab=all\">89 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiveSoulBro\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 1, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon its release, <b>Strider<\/b> promised gameplay faithful to the original series and attacks as responsive as your button presses. Poor marketing if you ask me. They leave out the magic of the Charge Strike Meter, which fills up every time you hit an enemy without getting hit yourself. Charge Mode is best described as &quot;Fry with 100 cups of coffee&quot; mode and for my money, blows away its Sleeping Dogs equivalent in the dust. It transforms the gameplay <u>entirely<\/u>, turning your Strider from a vulnerable hoppy-avoidy ninja who has to manage his button presses into the ultimate human chainsaw able to finish off monstrous killer robots before they can fire off their next shot. You lose all of that power the moment you get hit, so there's actual tension in those hellish games of chicken.<br><br>It might seem wrong to enjoy a Strider game on the strength of playing a death-crazed berzerker rather than a nimble evasive ninja, but it's fun in its own right and that's what counts; right? Dare I call it an intelligent button-masher? Because you work to enter Charge Mode, you work to stay in Charge Mode and you work to take advantage of the 5 seconds of Charge Mode, I say yes. That's right: <b>Strider<\/b> is worth your money for the 5 seconds of Charge Mode it provides. The exploration aspect? You live in a bleak cacotopia where every enemy is a one dimensional evil baddy. Finding stuff is a chore, not a reward. The attacks most associated with Strider, to wit the Slide and the Down Strike, feel tacked on by the necessity of this being a Strider franchise. In practice, these attacks are mostly used for area unlocking rather than combat. I might've bought this game on the strength of its franchise but now I've discovered a much greater, far more exciting game that would exist outside of it...<br><br>Other weapon mechanics are a mixed bag.Your Kunai and Options are powered by an energy bar which refills over time, encouraging you to use your specials at any time without taking undue importance from your Cypher attacks. Your Cypher Upgrades on the other hand seem oddly mismanaged. Your first upgrade is the Reflect Cypher and it's the coolest by far, turning you into some sort of Jedi and allowing you to reflect bolts with your sword <i>if you time it just right,<\/i> opening up synergy with the Charge Mode mechanic for its slowdown effect. Too bad enemies stop using reflectable bolts midway through the game. The second upgrade is the Burst Cypher and completely trivializes all other upgrades by simply making your enemy explode. It is, in fact, the best upgrade. Third upgrade is the Ultra-Cold Cypher, for turning enemies into ice platforms and better explore the game whle the fourth upgrade fires ranged boomerangs from your sword, somewhat defeating the whole &quot;you have a sword, your enemies have guns&quot; motif inherent to ninja-related games. It's the last upgrade though, and as such feels enough like an end-game mechanic that you forgive it for being dead simple.<br><br>Although not as exciting as the combat, the platforming can be enjoyable on its own thanks to the Plasma Catapult, your 8-way short-ranged teleport dash device. The challenge comes from planning your trajectory, working the flexible nature of your jumps along with the linear nature of the Plasma Catapult to form elaborate mid-air travel paths. The Plasma Catapult also gains from the Cypher Upgrades to form some cool but essentially useless gimmicks. For example, the Magnetic Plasma Catapult turns the targets you pass through into living magnets for enemy fire! Too bad it's tied to the ranged Magnetic Upgrade, making it more convenient to just shoot them from a distance. In fact, every combat gimmick tied to the Plasma Catapult is nullified by the fact that the Plasma Catapult <i>phases through your enemies<\/i>, bypassing the very notion of combat!<br><br>On the topic of Challenge Mode, one important notice for the developers: you need a way to show the player his top score and rank in a stage BEFORE they clicks the mission, so the player knows which stage they aced and which stage still needs work. Otherwise, since Story Mode is rather short and offers rather little replay options, alternative modes of play become greatly appreciated. Thankfully, Challenge Mode missions are built around the best aspects of the game: races across the city, and combat!<br><br>I gripe, but I had fun. The developers, <b>Double Helix Games<\/b>, have thrown a great deal of ideas at the wall and many of them stuck. You want a sequel and you want an editor, someone who will focus the game on the more thoughtful mechanics and axe all the overpowered \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. No seriously, the first Option you unlock, the bird, turns each and every boss fight into easy mode.

His heavy launcher from UMVC3 is here, for instance.  Enemies can be juggled, certain projectiles can be parried and alot of the &quot;outside the box&quot; stuff from modern action games are also implemented. I really appreciated being able to pull off some combos utilizing the launcher attack and the directional light attacks in the air. Along with special moves such as a ground slam ability you obtain, there's some depth to the combat system. <br><br>Strider's an assassin, he's not a tank. As the player, you'll be dodging attacks and avoiding bullets as opposed to blocking them. Hiryu's really mobile, so it's no problem. The lack of a block button might be off putting to those more comfortable with modern games, but I really liked figuring out patterns and dodging gunfire.<br><br>Boss battles are frequent and all of them feel satisfying to defeat. <br><br>The only real issue I found with this game is that the PC port does not seem to be optimized pretty well. I have a decent machine and was experiencing some slow down in certain areas, and constant screen tearing. Especailly during cinematics. <br><br><br>I would definitely give this a shot if you are a fan of Strider's previous games or just action platformers in general. It's a fantastic reboot, which often times feels like that'd be an oxymoron, but it works very well in Strider's case. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11346432', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11346432' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11346432\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11346432' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11346432\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11346432', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11346432_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11346432_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9261977\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"112702736\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/520b4335038588a4c91e9b2c51faf6d914e18a68.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/520b4335038588a4c91e9b2c51faf6d914e18a68.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/520b4335038588a4c91e9b2c51faf6d914e18a68_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/\" data-miniprofile=\"112702736\">SilverKurumi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/games\/?tab=all\">1,571 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ashdot\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">18.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStrider stands as a reboot to an old Arcade series by the same name. The game stars Hiryu, the last remaining Strider to be sent on a suicide mission that involves taking down Grandmaster Meio, the iron fisted ruler of Kazakh City and the Earth and avenging the fallen Striders.<br><br>The game's mechanics are pretty simple, like an old school title should. It's structured very similarly to some older games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid and the such as it has a lot of backtracking as well as you gain new powers to unlock new doors and the such - which may lead to new powers, health upgrades, energy upgrades, kunai upgrades, etc. There's lots to find in the game.<br><br>It's a standard Action Platformer, Strider can jump and he can cling to walls to get to higher places. It's a very vertical oriented game and you will need to explore literally every nook and cranny if you want to find every collectible. As you gain new powers, such as the Double Jump, or the Blast Cannon later on in the game, you gain more mobility and ways to go about exploring. <br>*~Some stages have Two planes, meaning it's a secondary map of the same stage that counts as one stage. You need a Power for it, which you get early on in the game. <br>*~There's also a way to move about each stage quicker when later on in the game you get the Panther Upgrade. These are called &quot;Panther Runs&quot; and they serve as key hubs in a stage, you essentially transport from one to another.<br>*~ The Kunai (which is an upgrade btw - you may see it on a Loading Screen tip but cannot use them until you obtain them later on), is used to open doors aswell. You target a door's recepticle (not on the door itself), the door unlocks and re locks after a certain time passes, so you have to be quick on these aswell.<br><br>Some stages, like the &quot;Black Market&quot; stage, have all sorts of traps and environmental hazards that serve as puzzles as their own. Taking damage from some of these traps can issue a &quot;Reset&quot; where Strider teleports back to the nearest safe zone or they can cause knockback. In other instances, hazards, such as Acid or Lava, deal constant damage as you stand on them.<br><br>*Note - There is NO Fast Travel options for those out there that need clarification on this. If you take your time out to explore, just like in those titles mentioned before, you HAVE to travel back by yourself through the stage. Also, I'm not pointing out every way you have to open doors, that's part of the challenge. <br><br>Combat is pretty straightforward aswell, with a few twists. At the beginning, you'll have your basic Cypher (Identifiable by the colour scarf Strider has) which doesn't do anything right then and there. Strider will attack as fast as you press the button too   which can help deal additional damage to bosses and enemies as well as the standard slash attack being omnidirectional. Wherever you point the analog stick is where Strider will strike. Ex- If you hold top right, Strider will attack top right. You also get a slide, which can help avoid enemy attacks and help you set up moves aswell. <br><br>Upgrades come in many different flavours. Your standard Cypher (Red Scarf - Also known later on as Reflective Cypher) gains the ability to deflect projectiles back at enemies and you also get a Charge attack very early on in the game which is needed to deal additional damage and break enemy shields. Cyphers also affect Kunais and Blast Cannon - but these upgrades need to be found separately. There are a total of 4 different Cyphers you'll be getting in the game additional to your standard one:<br>*Reflective Cypher (Red Scarf) - Deals normal damage, adds the ability do deflect enemy projectiles. No special Kunai Upgrades, No Special Blast Cannon Upgrades.<br>*Freeze Cypher (Blue Scarf) - Deals Normal damage, adds the ability to freeze enemies in place (enemies can be used as platforms). Kunai will freeze enemies on contact. Blast Cannon adds a wave where Strider is that will freeze enemies in place as you fly past them.<br>*Fire Cypher (Orange Scarf) - Deals the most damage, adds the ability to damage enemies over time. Kunai will attach and explode over time on enemies or ground. Blast Cannon will damage and burn enemies.<br>*Magnetic Cypher (Purple Scarf) - Turns Swipes into Boomerang (Cannot Mash button to attack faster - Have a max of 2 hits then must wait until blade comes back to you). Kunai bounces off surfaces, Blast Cannon deals additional damage.<br><br>Apart from these, obviously - Strider has 3 additional moves that expend energy, like the Kunais. Option-A (Eagle) appears above Strider and does a sweeping motion according from where it was summoned and hits for high damage, you'll be using this one a lot on bosses as it deals the most damage. Option-B (Panther) appears next to Strider, and moves forward until it hits a wall, then he runs the opposite direction (like a turtle shell in the Super Mario Bros games) and Option-C (Bots) summons two robots that appear around Strider that shoot spheres as you attack adding additional damage to your basic swipes. <br><br>Enemy types, sadly where the game faulters, is not very varied. You have your basic grunts with different weapon types - one can carry a Sniper Shot that if it hits you can cause knockback, another can have a rifle, shotguns, RPG's or a Machine Gun (deals most damage but won't see much of it during the game). Some grunts can carry shields - the non color shield can be destroyed by Option-A, Option-B or a Charged Swipe, likewise a Blue shield can only be destroyed by Freeze Cypher moves, Orange shields by Fire Cypher and Purple Shields by Magnet Cypher. The color shield enemy grunts only appear as you obtain the upgrades and then later on in the game, but they aren't really adding any challenge, more adding to the nuisance of having to switch Cyphers - like the Magnet Cypher, which was nigh useless to me outside of opening doors with it. One thing that annoyed me was how they only recolor the grunts and drop em on different stages, it felt a bit lazy. <br>Another enemy type, are flying bots that use about the same weapons grunt use and are really annoying, especially those that can cause knockback with rockets or heavy fire. Some bots later on, can actually charge at you and cause knockback. Then there are the larger enemies, like the Heavy Trooper (Yellow and Red) that have an arm that extends to where you are if they are facing you, or have napalm shots that home on where you were standing, you can deal with these guys easy though - the enemy that REALLY annoyed me was the Brainwalker, most of his attacks can cause knockback, he can charge at you and can push you off him if you're close enough - his shots can also home in on where you are.<br>Bosses fare a LOT better though. They all have attack patterns very similar to bosses from games like MegaMan X and some are actually pretty tough like Solo. <br><br>All in all though, bar a few annoyances, like Strider not being able to slash downwards directly if you're not jumping, the knockback state, the nearly useless Magnet Cypher and of course the game being short - this was definately one of my top games for 2014 and my top one for 2014 at the time of writing. It harkens back to older games like Symphony of the Night\/Super Metroid\/MegaMan X. Plays like one, feels like one and is a very welcome return for one of my old school favourite heroes very easily worth the asking price.<br><br>Pros:<br>+Amazing Combat System<br>+Fantastic Stage and Level designs<br>+Amazing Soundtrack<br>+Game looks amazing<br>+Great Particle and Weather effects<br>+Bosses can be challenging and tons of fun<br>+Tons to Explore and see<br>+Diverse Upgrade System<br>+Challenge Modes<br>+Tons of Collectibles<br><br>Cons<br>-Limited Enemy Archetypes<br>-Magnet Cypher is nigh useless in combat<br>-Knockback state can be annoying<br>-Game is short<br>-Odd Checkpoint system<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9261977', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9261977' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9261977\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9261977' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9261977\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9261977', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9261977_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9261977_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t63 of 84 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9184355\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"68024035\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d184e8eb2227072a28f4f84db0e1e985c77d394.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d184e8eb2227072a28f4f84db0e1e985c77d394.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d184e8eb2227072a28f4f84db0e1e985c77d394_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/\" data-miniprofile=\"68024035\">Stepwolve<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/games\/?tab=all\">614 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028289763\/recommended\/235210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDamn good action platformer.

Strider's signature katana arc is in full evidence here, allowing you to let loose a pleasing flurry of attacks or charge up for a longer-range strike. Movement includes an array of somersault jumps and combine with a wall-climbing mechanic that is never too clingy (as such mechanics can sometimes be). Basically, every room of enemies can be a fun, adrenaline-filled dance - and this is just with the basic toolset the game starts with.<br><br>There's some interesting depth here - you not only get ranged kunai attacks, a short teleporter hop and three extra modes for your sword, but each of these get different effects in combination, giving you plenty of high-energy options to take down even bigger foes with finesse. There's also a chain-based higher damage mode you can get to if you score a high succession of hits - I never popped the achievement for doing this 25 times, but I managed to quickly take down the one boss I had any real trouble by trigging a succession of these, and like everything else in this game's combat, it has the capacity to make you feel like the ultra-badass you probably aren't.<br><br>Elsewhere, the game can be unexceptional, though not in any significantly detrimental way. This Strider goes full Metroidvania, and while the aforementioned puzzles are great to track down, it lacks the clever item placement of something like Super Metroid (and for better or worse, there's nothing like that game's shine sparking to test your skills\/patience). The environments are thoughtfully if visually unspectacular in their construction - though gameplay is on a 2D plane they've done a great job of layering things in the background and foreground, but it can all look a little samey and the series' distinctive cyber-soviet environments seem a little low-key this time round.<br><br>Enemy design is a similar story - in terms of function they've nailed it (on sight you have a good idea how an encounter is going to go down, and attacks are appropriately telegraphed so you can get on with the business of dodging and obliterating) but the designs don't really stick in your memory. Bosses are a little better on this front, though they're ultimately lifted from earlier games (and they have some over-used chatter before you encounter them).<br><br>Still, unless you've recently burned yourself out on Metroidvania-esque titles, there's more than enough style and substance in this game. I've owed this one a review for three years now - taken me around this time to actually have a machine that can run it (oddly) - Chris covered for me on thereticule <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/(http:\/\/thereticule.com\/strider-the-verdict\/)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >(http:\/\/thereticule.com\/strider-the-verdict\/)<\/a>, but I couldn't resist singing it's praises myself, especially as three years on, it seems to have largely been forgotten.
