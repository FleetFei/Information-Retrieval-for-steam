Yes! Is it something everyone can enjoy? No. I'll pass on pointing out the good things for now and look at the bad things throughout, so that I can get started with how to improve it. First of all, it's full of bugs, and some scenes seem a lot like rip-offs from other rpg horror game(ex: in the opening you learn that your mother died and you ask your father to go visit her grave tomorrow). There was a lot of frustrating scenes in it which were really hard to figure out on your own. No clues were given for them what-so-ever. One example is when in the mansion I had no idea I could fill the bottle with holy water, and I had no idea I even needed holy water! The game does not tell you ''go get holy water'', no, it just leaves you alone wandering around trying to find what to do next. It also has a lot of tile and clipping errors. If I had a penny for everything I could walk over in this game, I would be one of the richest men of my country. It also has a lot of spelling and grammar errors. At times sentences aren't started with capital letters, and at one point in the game you see that the word ''orphan'' has been spelled as ''orphin''. The maps are empty and bland, and unnecessarily huge, and there are a lot of tiles error like I mentioned. Why did the bookshelves have additional bookshelves below them? It did not make sense, and there were gaps too. Light effects felt cheap, most of the time they went over walls and they had no blur to them what-so-ever, and that's not how lights work in real life at all. You can also interact with things even when not facing them. Also the final scene with lots of monsters was just, way too hard. It took me like 50 attempts trying to get all endings(atleast I didn't die at all with the true ending X3). The game also teaches you that angel statues save, however later on there are angel statues in the game that don't do anything. If they won't do anything, why did we learn about them? One other thing is, the developer does not know how to remove party members from the looks of it. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Even after he died and when you fell down the well<\/span><\/span> Jacob is still in your party, and also, one game breaking bug I found is when you go to the room where you place the dagger after forging it, returning to the big library will cause the flashback to reset.<br><br>So why did I like this?<br><br>Honestly, no idea myself. It had lots of flaws, and needed a lot of polishing, but something about me just really wants to like this game. Is it my sense of being way too easily impressed? Is it my love for these kinds of games? Something about it really drawed me into it, and I thought it was really bad, but in the same time I thought it was good. Honestly, with a few bug fixes and a little more dialog improvement this could be made into something great. It really has that potential. I did a 3 part let's play on it, and I will share the playlist when all parts are done uploading. It had good scenes, and some parts that were actually pretty good, like the library and the crypt. Although I don't see how <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Jacob died. All Rebecca had to do was move down 1 tile and because she's an idiot  Jacob pushed her out of the way instead, and if you tihnk of it, if Jacob can move up three tiles to save Rebecca she should be able to move down one tile too<\/span><\/span>. There were some nice death scenes along the game but also some that are plain lame. For example in the sewers if you enter a room you will be killed by a goblin. No warning was given for this at all, and you did not get to save before it either. I could clearly see that this game follows WilliamTheUnproPro's Let's Make A Rpg Horror Game tutorials on youtube, and one map is just a plain rip-off of it.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/rpgmaker.net\/media\/content\/users\/52923\/locker\/copy.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/rpgmaker.net\/media\/content\/users\/52923\/locker\/copy.png<\/a><br><br>Again, I'm saying it. This game isn't for everyone. This isn't a professional rpg maker game that really stands out, it's very amateur. If you do not like buggy games made by newbie developers don't get this, but I played it and liked it quite a lot, despite the fact of pointing out more cons than pros.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19352870', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19352870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19352870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19352870' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19352870\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19352870', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19352870_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19352870_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19132333\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141806311\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"181540583\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141806311\/\" data-miniprofile=\"181540583\">Phantom<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141806311\/games\/?tab=all\">9 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141806311\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141806311\/recommended\/410050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like it.

You also have no direct point of what you need or what to grab, it's mainly just hope you find something and get it right or risk starting all over if you have no multisaves. Rebecca, the main character, is a little bland and too cheerful and doesn't seem to really have much depth into her, just random 'things' that come to her as she explores the forgotten forest after being forced to run into it. There isn't much more I can say on this, but... yeah it's up to the person to buy it or not, but I say there are better RPGs out there, but if you're one to just play all of them then go ahead.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28204197', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28204197' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28204197\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28204197' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28204197\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28204197', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28204197_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28204197_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/410050\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 7 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["19352870","19132333","28204197"]}
