It took me a few times playing it to really understand what is happening, but once I understood what I was doing, I found the puzzles to be quite challenging, yet achievable.  Unlike most games like this, if you just randomly start matching items, while you can complete a level, you won't be able to hit the target score.  It takes more strategy to understand where to start and where to focus to hit the high scores.  So if you enjoy a matching type game, but want one with more strategy and planning, you should try Fourtex Jugo.<br><br>As I said, it took me a few plays to understand what I was really trying to do.  Here's what I found out.<br><br>The goal of the game is to get to a target score for a puzzle.  To do this, you'll need to score as many points as you can.  You get the most points by making Voids.  However, once you make one Void, basically the final stage of the game starts - so you want to hold off making Voids until you are just about ready to finish.  You end a game by using all 16 squares of the 4x4 grid.  Voids are made by combining oms of different colors.  Oms are created by combining pis.  Pis are made by combining two numbers that add to 15 or combining two 14's.  Numbers are created by combining like numbers (so combining two 5's will make a 6.)<br><br>So basically you combine numbers, building them up to 14's, or combine two that add to 15.  Make as many different types of pis as you can.  There's a pattern to how to make different pis.  Combine the pis make oms.  Try and get a good collection of black and white oms ready to combine (ideally you get a 4x4 grid with 8 black and 8 white oms), while not closing out the 4x4 grid.  Then combine the oms and quickly close out the grid.  It is more complicated that other games like this, but that's what I liked about it.  You need to study how the board is repopulated from the sides and determine how to attack the board to get the pi then om then void states.<br><br>The variety of puzzles they include require different strategies, so you're not just playing the same strategy over and over.<br><br>Again, if you're looking for a casual game with some depth to it, give Fourtex Jugo a try.   It's a casual game for the strategist in you.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27992883', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27992883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27992883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27992883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27992883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27992883', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27992883_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27992883_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/499560\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["27992883"]}
