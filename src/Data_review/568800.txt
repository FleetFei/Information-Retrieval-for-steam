You advance from every decade from the 1980s thru the present day, and the room progressively changes. It's based on the memories of those who were students in the 80s and 90s, and grown ups in the 2000s and 2010s. There's a love story attached, but non-Chinese speakers won't be able to grasp much of it. The real appeal for the player who doesn't speak Chinese are the sights and sounds of the room.<br><br>Based on translations of the Chinese reviews, some of this simulation isn't entirely historically accurate. Some of the magazines are the wrong date, et cetera....But in general, you get a very good feel of how things were in China each decade. It's been a period of extremely rapid modernization, which shows thru the game.<br><br>The game is entirely in Chinese, but it's very easy to figure out. I got to the second level on my first try, and the third level on my second try. All you can do is pick up things, move them, and touch them. A good portion of the time, a shining light will tell you what to interact with next.<br><br>The game is buggy and easy to screw up. Keys are frequently used, and if you lose the key....well, tough luck. It might slide under the bed and leave you stranded on a certain level. The level is big, so if your playspace is too small, you can't play. No teleportation, unfortunately.<br><br>There's really only about an hour to two hours of gameplay here when it's all said and done. The most disappointing thing is that the TV and Radio do not work. I think it may be due to links to video or audio that only work in China, but that's just a guess. I do not believe Chinese players had the same problem.<br><br>That being said, I don't regret the purchase. Being able to explore another culture for that short amount of time was really refreshing compared to the other VR experiences. One of my favorite early titles, for sure.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29249812', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29249812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29249812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29249812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29249812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29249812', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29249812_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29249812_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/568800\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 14 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29249812"]}
