becomes available at mission 25 on normal mode, they are also reasonably expensive with a base price of $3.50 SGD considering they won't last very long in terms of performance.<br><br>I would recommend it if you like driving\/collecting tanks with cute anime style prints on it as I do.<br>I would not recommend it if you are looking for a overpowered DLC to carry your game.<br><br>I have 4 out of 5 of the Ita-tank DLCs (the DCC Zero performs identically to the GoGo) and after hours of driving them,this is where the Natsuiro Highschool Markings sits :<br><br>+ Great Prints<br>+ Has a watergun to subdue rioting giant insects<br>+ Deceptively good damage per second<br>+ Comes with so much ammunition that you usually switch vehicles before you run dry (haha geddit?)<br>+ Tank is ridiculously agile and has the same HP as the other DLC tanks<br>+ Has utility as a command tank to drive around and call artillery from because of its mobility<br>+ Is a unique novelty<br>+ You are actually shooting water so you won't hurt yourself<br>+ Bonus points if you're familiar with the Natsuiro HS game...you pervert<br><br>+\/- You look very silly<br><br>- Gun feels like a toy and the tank drives like one<br>- Turret turns way too quickly making it quite difficult to keep track of your target<br>- Yucky Yellow base paint<br>- Limited range<br>- Gun has to be kept on target to deal damage<br>- Gun does not feel like its doing damage<br>- You can only see the girls when you're infront of the tank or standing on top of it<br><br><br><br>This is easily the most unique out of all the DLC tanks.<br>The gun itself makes it pretty clear that its not really a serious vehicle and the handling reinforces that.<br>However the gun is surprisingly viable,dealing more damage than expected as long as you keep it on target.<br>It is a shame that it comes in horrendous shade of yellow, it would have been perfect if it came in a pleasant color and with a turret slowed down slightly to manageable levels.<br>All in all, this is the one you want to get if you're only planning to buy 1 DLC tank.<br><br><br>tl;dr <br><br>Like cute anime tanks and willing to spend $$$? Go for it. Has the most novelty factor.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24598391', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24598391' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24598391\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24598391' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24598391\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24598391', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24598391_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24598391_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24598391"]}
