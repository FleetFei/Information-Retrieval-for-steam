In Heroes of Steel, you select a party of four from one of two classes out of your standard four pen and paper archetypes: fighter, mage, cleric and rogue; then you're off on a surprisingly well-written adventure.<br><br>Your characters have individual personalities and interact with each other in thoughtful ways throughout the game's very, very, very many scenarios, which essentially consist of large grid maps, the objective of which is to navigate, avoid traps, kill the baddies and reach the exit. The game is largely mouse-based, and you can swap between any character at any time, even stopping their turns during combat to use another character. <br><br>Combat is similar to the original Fallout series where each character has seven 'advantage points', or AP, allowing them to move and perform actions. Rogues can peek around corners (in a matter of speaking), clerics can heal, mages throw lightning bolts, and pretty much every character can buff themselves in some way, consuming SP from a fairly large individual pool.<br><br>You level up at camp sites, free recovery points that allow you to increase your attributes, skills and learn new abilities. There's some room for character customization, but from what I've seen characters will all stay within their archetypal niche -- a warrior can't learn to pick locks, for instance.<br><br>It all sounds fairly rote, and the moderately primitive top-down 2D graphics will potentially drive some people away (and is, to be honest, the reason why I have not picked it up until now, despite looking far better in action) but I am sorely regretting that decision -- Heroes of Steel is a well-written, solid dungeon romp with an <b>absurd<\/b> amount of content. A dungeon map will occupy your time for at least an hour per, and there's over 100 dungeon maps in Heroes of Steel, providing a mind-boggling amount of gameplay.<br><br>Don't be fooled by the $10 pricetag for this indie gem, it's well worth it.<br><br>Pros:<br>+Interesting scenario writing<br>+Fun, intuitive combat<br>+Solid RPG mechanics<br>+Good music<br>+Very, very lengthy campaign<br>+Good value for the price<br><br>Cons:<br>-Somewhat archaic (or &quot;indie&quot;) graphical design<br>-Interface takes a brief period to get used to<br><br>All in all, I can't really think of that many negatives. For fans of turn- or party-based RPGs, especially fans of Spiderweb-style games, don't do yourself a disservice and miss out on this one.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30526490', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30526490' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30526490\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30526490' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30526490\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30526490', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30526490_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30526490_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t153 of 160 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12961605\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"64767326\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9109a143c584801d110bc9d530f93316c2c38260.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9109a143c584801d110bc9d530f93316c2c38260.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9109a143c584801d110bc9d530f93316c2c38260_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/\" data-miniprofile=\"64767326\">vintoks<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/games\/?tab=all\">478 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198025033054\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">349.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 15, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHeroes of Steel is an old school &quot;pickup and play&quot; tactical party combat RPG. It shares common ground with systems in the Ultima series and Final Fantasy Tactics (overhead grid tactics) along with wizardry style dungeon crawlers (Fixed party of 4 specific roles making a fighting unit).<br><br>I emphasize this is a combat game because that really is what the game is: a COMBAT game! 80% of what you do is fight and kill enemies, the other 20% is a mix of exploring and gear\/stat management with some light story sprinkled in to keep a cohesive experience.<br><br>The combat turn is free forming where your characters do any action in whatever order you wish. The characters don't have to complete all of their actions before selecting the next character, and there is no turn order. For example you have have a caster debuff a monster, have your fighter run up to it and smack it, then have the caster nuke a different monster, then retreat your fighter back to support your caster all in 1 turn.<br><br>The game is a slow burn and takes a couple hours to get off the ground.The combat can seem like a foot slog at times, especially in the beginning when your party is just starting and you don't have many options. It takes time for the game to open up. Most RPGs are also guilty of this, but it is worth mentioning that you wont be tearing through the enemy with ease right from the get go. <br><br>There will be tough situations and battles of attrition where you have combat waves of enemies or large engagements and heavy odds. Certain battles can last the better part of an hour. Some people may be off put by the battle length, but the game auto saves all the time so you can quit out and continue anytime (including midbattle) they also added an animation skip option to help quicken combat downtime.<br><br>The game is challenging but fair. Enemies aren't pushovers, the threat of dying from careless play or overextending is always there. Often you kill enemies fast, but if you are careless they will kill you fast. It's important to figure out a fighting style or general group strategy that suits you and then SPECIALIZE. The whole party is a UNIT, each individual fulfilling a specific role. Damage and healing are obvious but good crowd control, and positioning are more subtle and just as significant.These subtleties are important as you advance into episode 2 (20-30 hours) and beyond when the enemy AI behavior ramps up to where things like: tactical retreats, luring\/pulling, stealth attacks, cursing, repositioning, and using terrain are paramount or you will die a lot.<br><br>Speaking of death, it is handled in a very intuitive way. There is no resurrection or revive mechanic. If any of your characters die, you are given the option to retry the turn (this rewinds the game back one turn so you can try again, or you can reset back to the beginning of the dungeon area before the engagement. This is handy to start the fight from scratch or leave the area to resupply. The only negative for death is a hit to your total learderboard score.<br><br>The game encourages you to explore every nook and cranny and to kill EVERYTHING you come across. Stealth basically boils down to a way of getting the first turn in combat (getting an edge on buff\/debuffs and positioning) and getting high critical bonuses on sneak attacks.<br><br>In fact, the game is so combat focus that it is hard to avoid most fights. There is no &quot;escaping combat&quot; mechanic. This can be a problem if fights goes badly. In this situation it is usually best to try and salvage by a tactical retreat for a few turns and regroup, or to let yourself die and restart before the engagement.<br><br>The story and dialog adds purpose and life to the game without destroying the game pacing or getting in the way of the combat. Story and dialog are pretty well done. The highlight here is the interaction between your characters and their reactions to things in the world around them.There are some cliche things but nothing too grating. It uses some common themes like a post-apocalyptic world and Norse myths, but it has enough twists and different situations to keep things interesting. There are some critical choice paths to make throughout, but interactions are never meant to take away from the combat focus.<br><br>The UI is easy to understand and the battle system and descriptions are clear and well explained. But some things need improvement like: more general graphic and ui options, more keyboard shortcuts, more ways to sort equipment.Some of this just comes from its trappings as a mobile game first but they could definitely help.<br>Edit: In an update the devs added a mini status\/buff display, tool tips and more recently improved keybaord shortcuts, steam controller support and possibly controller support on the way. Good job on them improving this!<br><br>Rebuffing between fights can sometimes be a chore due to certain buffs needing a specific formation to optimize the buff and apply to all party members at once. <br>Edit: In a recent update this problem has be resolved Auto Buff! This basically refreshes all buffs on all party members with one button click, no more repositioning and having to individually cast every buff!<br><br>Health and Mana management is done mostly through camping at specific sites spread around the dungeons or consumable items (potions, scrolls, etc) There are some skills that can help this along, like a skill that lets you sacrifice mana of one character to refill another's sort of like a mana &quot;battery.&quot; This system works well for the most part. If you do struggle sometimes its better to go back to the local town or camp to refill your HP and Mana for free instead of consuming a ton of potions. Being conservative and walking back and forth isn't instant and can slow the game's pacing down a lot at times. Something like a town portal or zone teleport for dungeons you have already explored would help with the downtime here. Edit: The devs added a fast movement option which does help with downtime.<br><br>Raising your statistics and leveling up is handled in a traditional D&amp;D sense where you raise an attribute like strength or constitution, then raise a martial mastery like a weapon or magic skill like blades or conjuration. Then allocate points to improve a specific active skill like &quot;Crushing Blow,&quot; &quot;Healing&quot; or &quot;Fireball.&quot; Theses skills often have the trend where as you increase them they get more potent but cost more, so you need to balance it. This isn't too difficult to figure out and you can sit on unspent points if you don't know what to pick, but it is important to not spread your talents too thin and to have a goal or strategy in mind. It takes some critical thinking and planning as it is possible to make a counter intuitive build. Edit:Thankfully the devs updated with a respec option!<br><br>The music ambiance isn't bad, but it lacks variety and needs more songs added to the score.

I could have went on playing much more, this game is HUGE&gt; Huge world with many dungeons to explore. much loot to find, many characters to encounter, upgrading system, great world map, towns to explore, skills to try on enemies, interesting story and quests, and much more. I enjoy this game so much and I plan on starting over because so much has been added. Also great developers that will help with anything, so hands on. One of my surprise games for sure, also I found myself getting attached to my team.

Full respect for the time and effort the Trese brothers put into their games. Personally I ran into a very minor issue with the game, the dev responded instantly and a patch was out the following day. What more could I ask for? That shows a lot of passion and dedication to their product.<br>Constant patches\/improvements, always active on the forums and actually talking to their players. <br><br>The combat system is solid with 8 different characters to choose from to make your party of 4.<br>The story and characters are well written and interesting including their interactions between each other. <br>A range of weapons, armour and other equipment can either be looted or purchased from merchants including the ever necessary consumables.<br>Skill\/talent and stat points as you level, and easy respecing.<br>Personally I quite enjoy the art style in the game and zooming in the combat map the character models still look good.<br>I've been having a lot more fun with this game then I expected, it's definitaly worth it's asking price.<br>I'm looking forward to sinking a lot more time into this over the weekend.<br><br>Trese brothers are ones to watch, truly passionate game creation wizards. This game and Templar Battleforce have won my loyalty. Side note it is really worth checking out Templar Battleforce as well :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20392827', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20392827' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20392827\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20392827' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20392827\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20392827', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20392827_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20392827_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18235580\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982893207\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"22627479\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f58f840f52d7cd5103226960f472d67a0510f7b3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f58f840f52d7cd5103226960f472d67a0510f7b3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f58f840f52d7cd5103226960f472d67a0510f7b3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982893207\/\" data-miniprofile=\"22627479\">Godwin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982893207\/games\/?tab=all\">1,360 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982893207\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982893207\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">78.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally nice RPG with a cool story.<br>Lots of fighting, big dungeons, cool premise (society had to go underground). I just completed Act 1 of Episode 1, there are 3 full episodes now, with a 4th coming, each with about 2 Acts. So at 40 hours I am about 1\/8th of the way in (admittedly, I like to take my time and left the game running while tending to other stuff quite a lot, but still, plenty of content!).<br>Episodes by the way are all included in the game, it's just their word for chapter, there is no additional DLC\/expansion.<br><br>I like the story and the way the characters talk to each other. The combat is fun.<br><br>All in all this game has a lot of charm, and for me that's plenty of reason to keep playing. At 10 euros it's a very good deal imo, even if it sometimes feels a bit crude\/rough around the edges (just adds to the charm).<br><br>It comes across as a game created with a lot of love and passion, and it's very well supported by the devs, and that's also a big plus imo.<br><br>EDIT: Wow, the story really opens up in Act 2 of Episode 1! :D\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18235580', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18235580' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18235580\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18235580' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18235580\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18235580', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18235580_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18235580_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12590185\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198110722135\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"150456407\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de95cf36034892c1347d69cc63e99bea4a1c68fa.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de95cf36034892c1347d69cc63e99bea4a1c68fa.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de95cf36034892c1347d69cc63e99bea4a1c68fa_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198110722135\/\" data-miniprofile=\"150456407\">rearick<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198110722135\/games\/?tab=all\">9 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198110722135\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198110722135\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">30.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 20, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI would recommend this game to others especially if you enjoy a long story that is well-written and based in the framework of a squad-based tactical game.  The story does have it's moments of cheese, but underneath the artwork and first-time PC dev interface is a game system that's been honed over years in table-top play.<br><br>Basically from what I can gather on their forums, the devs have been world-building and playing out RPGs for decades and that really shows in the care and balance that goes into building out the game mechanics.  I've played more than a few RPGs that are beautiful visually and have a slick interface, but have zero thought going into skill advancement or how a squad can be built out.<br><br>The one thing I'd love people to realize about this game is that it's both long and evolving.  You can get a taste through the prologue of the game but the full flavors don't develop until you're well into it.  Also, this game has had 22 updates on Steam as of the writing of this review and there are more in the works.  These are devs that engage with players and are doing it the right way with a small staff.<br><br>Definitely buy this game if you are looking for a tactical game for the long haul.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12590185', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12590185' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12590185\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12590185' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12590185\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12590185', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12590185_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12590185_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14734321\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141516986\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"181251258\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9eacb4435c25433f789bd570768ddced6d0b7807.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9eacb4435c25433f789bd570768ddced6d0b7807.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9eacb4435c25433f789bd570768ddced6d0b7807_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141516986\/\" data-miniprofile=\"181251258\">Carda [NL]<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141516986\/games\/?tab=all\">163 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141516986\/recommended\/\">20 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198141516986\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">27.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI wanted to give you my opinion about the gameplay I encountered so far in Heroes of Steel. The more I play this game, the more I am falling in love with it. Let me start first with telling you a bit about the battlesystem. As a Turn Based RPG fanatic, this battlesystem works great for me. You have 4 partymembers (for example Tank, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric), a turn based combat system with action points (like Jagged Alliance or Divine Divinity Original Sin) and some very enjoyable encounters to overcome. I started playing on hard and I think that's the right way to play this game.<br><br>There is a good story in this game, all characters in your party have their own 'goal' and I love reading their chats and thoughts. The skillsystem works great, each character has like 10 different skills to upgrade each level up (each skill has 10 levels to improve them) so for replayability that's a good thing, you can make very different party setups at start and through the game with the different skills.<br><br>The game graphics aren't 3D and it doesnt look like an AAA title but gameplay goes first for me and this game surely delivers in gameplay (specially when you reach the first town, the game really starts). I recommend watch some gameplay videos on youtube or here on Steam to see if it's to your liking or not.<br><br>Developers keep on bringing new content for free, like new dungeons and weapons. So NO micro transactions for new content, just a free update from steam and it's in your game. Developers are also very active on the forum and will help wherever they can.<br><br>Now it's time to continue with my game, I hope this was usefull for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14734321', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14734321' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14734321\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14734321' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14734321\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14734321', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14734321_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14734321_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14542112\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46967466\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/74\/74f171718fde7acba039485cbcd1d08565a4bd8d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/74\/74f171718fde7acba039485cbcd1d08565a4bd8d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/74\/74f171718fde7acba039485cbcd1d08565a4bd8d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46967466\">Telparion<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/games\/?tab=all\">504 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/recommended\/\">18 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aekar\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow guys let me tell you: <br><br>This game has more WARHAMMER QUEST feeling to it than even the Warhammer Quest mobile port. It's my opinion, not fact, but I really felt that WQ boardgame flavor when I played, and I can tell you it is a great feeling.<br><br>How can it be so?<br>It doesn't have random quests and although it seems to possibly have some random loot, Heroes of Steel has a real story to live, not a short theme for a quick mission.<br><br>I believe it comes from its top view and tactical combat system, but also thanks to the danger the game puts your heroes through. In WQ mobile port, you do not feel the threat. In Heroes of Steel, you do - you feel hunted, you want to survive until the next safe spot, and you'll do your best to get to it.<br><br><br>Now let's get deeper into this review. <br><br>Good points are that:<br>Heroes of Steel surprised me with quality tactical combat, interesting choices and great dialogues! Enough qualities to make you purchase it.<br><br>Read below to know more about the weak spots in the game, but if you want to enjoy nice boardgame tactical combat, well written dialogues, and a nice &quot;party roleplaying&quot; aspect, you may go for it. <br><br><br>The dialogues are very well written and make us feel like on a serious tabletop RPG. There are nice reactions between teammaters and we know something more is to discover here. We want to see the next steps. The game also feels like having a great duration to it. I only got to the first town here and there surely are a lot more hours to put into the game.<br><br>The choices themselves, though sometimes limited between two paths to get through, are interesting enough; the game makes you feel the danger, threats can get really oppressive (I so much wanted to get out of the caverns!) and the camp spots make sure you are always on your guard as you'll always be lacking healing options. In an atmosphere like this, even picking a path is great, especially as taking the dangerous one also triggers nice dialogues (see above :) ) between your characters.<br><br><br>As for the tactics, some combats are really tough, but moreover,  the skill and AP system is very well implemented. With each character's progression you have to make some interesting decisions. After playing dozens of roguelikes and RPGs, I feel Heroes of Steel has a very nice system deserving to be at the top 10 of these games.<br><br>The art and UI were the two elements that really frustrated me at the beginning. The art is original but doesn't always have the &quot;pro&quot; touch. 2D indie games need great 2D art (at least a few pics of them) and here this is something that is a bit lacking. Some arts are &quot;hit or miss&quot;. Still, the game is more than good enough to make you enjoy the rest.

I'm so glad it's finally on Steam.  The PC version is great because you get the bigger screen, keyboard commands and quick keys, and easy zoom.  The game is otherwise the same as the mobile versions.  This is an enormous game which is not yet complete, and is constantly changing.  I keep telling myself I will play something else but everytime there is a new update (which is very frequent, sometimes 2 per week) I have to try out the changes.  There is one more character to be released, the Dueler, a warrior.  To briefly describe the game: it is a turn based RPG with the standard 4 characters of warrior, cleric, thief and magician.  The tactics part comes as you learn to fight the various monsters in this world and work on building your party with talents that complement and enhance each other.  You can spend months just trying different character builds to see how they work and which characters they work best with.  The replayability is incredible.  Don't think you'll become bored by seeing the same maps over and over.  The updates I mentioned often come with new bosses, new secret doors, new sidequests, new areas . . . as I mentioned before the game is constantly changing.  You can play at several difficulty levels from easy to nightmare (for those gluttons for punishment).  I know that other reviews will tell about the storyline plus you can read the description from the developers, so I won't go into that except to say that it is complex and very interesting.  Heroes of Steel provides you so much value for your money. It is larger than many games I have bought at two or three times the price and will keep you entertained far longer.  <br>This review has gotten too long, I need to go back to the game!<br><br>If you want to see a tutorial to learn more about gameplay go to:  <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.indiegameguides.com\/Heroes-of-Steel\/tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.indiegameguides.com\/Heroes-of-Steel\/tutorial<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9914912', 'summary' );

Came into this game blind, after seeing that a friend had played it quite a bit during the holiday season and will have to say that it is one of the most memorable turn based experiences I've had. So here's a fervent thank you from me to the developers for making a very engaging turn based tactics game with good depth and options!<br><br>The basic to-hit system in melee pits rolling multiple sets of dice (attacking dice from points in Accuracy\/weaponskill\/Str or Dex vs defending dice from points in Parry\/Dodge\/weaponskill) against each other, with success for each dice being determined by a certain threshold and the overall result of the attack being a hit, if attacking dice had more or equal number of successes compared to defending dice. <br>Unlike some other RPGs, there is no straightforward to-hit percentage with flat increases per attribute upgrades and while not particularly intuitive at first glance, it is an interesting system with considerable nuance. For one there are 2 thresholds, one for strong dice (succeeds on a roll of 6 or more on a D10) and one for standard dice (succeeds on a roll of 8), which mean some attributes like Accuracy on weapons and empowered attacks are quite a bit more valuable on the attack. Similarly while Parry values are not taken into account when facing ranged attacks, they are better than Dodge when going up against melee as all Parry points are strong defensive dice. This system by its nature, also provides diminishing returns on extra points (dice) and may incentivize more balanced attribute levelling at some point. <br>In some ways, a more complex system like this one can be appealing to those willing to spend a little time exploring the mechanics and I for one, welcome it as a fresh change.<br><br>Damage outcome is also nicely designed in that armor directly soaks a certain amount (half of Armor value) of physical damage, with the other half of its value being a random amount. This results in lighter weapons which cost less AP and have more strikes per turn being strong against unarmored foes but relatively ineffective against heavily armored ones, a good tradeoff.<br><br>The AP centric battle system, where available movement and actions per round on a grid-based battlefield are dictated by the number of Movement\/Action Points is intuitive and enables considerable ease on planning positions\/moves. Some opponents have less AP than the party (kiteable foes where ranged attacks and use of choke points are likely to be feasible) and some have equal or more AP than party members (non-kiteable foes where brute force and careful positioning are needed). The accompanying map design\/layouts were all well thought out too, with some maps providing suitable choke points and others being a cornered fight or open battlefield requiring more care. <br><br>In particular, I liked that the 4 party members complement each other well with a good array of different talents (including special strikes, heals, buffs, debuffs and various utility talents). There are various buffs that increase basic attributes (Str), stats (Accuracy) and even movement points. Similarly there is a good mix of debuffs that lower enemy Parry\/Dodge and Armor values and even those that strip them of AP. Indeed battlefield efficiency will be dependent on finding a health balance of the above. Sid Meier once said: &quot;a game is a series of interesting choices&quot; and indeed the game does present an interesting array of choices in which to approach combat, dependent on one's playstyle, party members and of course talents levels and gear.<br>It is also nice to see that higher level talents (while certainly more potent) also require more SP, thereby making the choice to upgrade, one that actually requires some thought and which is partially dependent on one's playstyle and SP drain gear. Expending too much SP in regular fights can result in more frequent use of consumables, a resource the player may not have when dealing with tougher battles later on, so a careful balance needs to be struck.<br><br><br>In terms of the storyline, I like the fact that the characters' background\/experiences are neatly woven into the storyline and am eager to see how it will all turn out later on, with gods and all. Would be nice to have a short bio for each character which writes itself as the story progresses (similar to Valkyria Chronicles). The Underdeep is a fascinating place with a good amount of lore and it would be great to have a handy reference to connect the dots more easily. It's good to have various townsfolk discuss the world and its events with the party and some even send the party on side quests, as this lends more color\/depth to the tale. I'm hoping future episodes will feature more branching decisions where the party can choose to affect world affairs. The story held my interest all the way throughout Episode 1 and is one of the stronger selling points of the game, besides gameplay of course.<br><br>Finally I would like to laud the commitment of the devs on listening to feedback (on forums) and on continuously polishing their product after release. Virtually no game is completely bug free upon release and willingness to tweak display and fix minor issues, is a mark of developers who care about the quality of their work. Would once again like to say that I've thoroughly enjoyed Heroes of Steel thus far and hope more turn based enthusiasts will find their way here too and give this game the support that it richly deserves.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29290640', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29290640' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29290640\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29290640' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29290640\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29290640', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29290640_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29290640_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29245180\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070742314\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"110476586\">ruppert29<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 278.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI find the game challenging, fun with a good story.

The Trese brothers support for their games and community is longstanding and ongoing. Even their unprofitable games get bug fixes 5+ years in, everything else gets new features and some graphics updates to boot. This is my favorite game of theirs even though Templar Battleforce is their current state of the art until Star Traders 2 comes out. For me the game has proven intellectually demanding enough, while staying perfectly enjoyable, to improve the clarity of my thinking which has been impaired by chronic illness, a very positive thing indeed for me.<br><br>The world: <br><br>A fallen mix of civilizations forced underground by &quot;The shattering&quot; with fallen &quot;gods&quot; and races such as Orcin, Trolls and Ratkin as well as humans of course. Some lore is given at loading screens, the rest is through the played out story.<br><br><br>Playable characters: <br><br>A set of four: Warrior, Mystic, Healer and Sneak. There are currently 2 choices for each class: <br><br>Warrior: Vraes the outlander\/barbarian who can use any melee weapon and shields, or Kincaid the dueler who uses swords and\/or throwing knives.<br><br>Mystic: Kjartan the wizard, a long ranged fire damage caster and ranged curser who's terrible at melee and super squishy, or Vincent the Sorcerer with a spell sword with long range curses, medium range lightning attacks and\/or single target or AoE melee skills.<br><br>Healer: Kyera the cleric, with ranged attack and cursing or melee, or Fyona the Paladin a tough melee and short ranged curser. Both can heal your party between campsites and inns.<br><br>Sneak: Tamilin the thief with throwing knives with powerful short range curse or high damage potential bow, or Selen the rogue, with excellent melee and defense talents or effective ranged cursing via her bow. Both can disarm traps, pick locks and gain a surprise round through stealth if they lead the party.<br><br><br>The art: Honestly it started off as pretty mediocre, even bad, but the artist, Andrew Trese has hugely improved his skill and has been slowly introducing updated graphics particularly for the main characters. the latest portraits have nearly reached a photorealistic effect, but the animations are still mostly serviceable. The effects graphics are pretty good though.<br><br><br>Play time: <br><br>80+ hours in four major story segments with pretty good replayability.<br><br>The good: plenty of time to engage in the story and develop tactics.<br><br>The bad: Not for those interested in a short journey.<br><br><br>The Trese brothers tend to put a lot of variables in the background mechanics to give your chances of success a lot a variations. They've gotten better about documenting these things over the years, but if you don't want to learn a fair number of hidden systems then you may either want to stay away from their games, stick with their newer games with nearly full libraries (Templar Battleforce onward), or stick to easy strategy guides set up by themselves and their player base on Steam and\/or their forum etc. I'll give a couple key tips for Heroes of Steel at the end of this review. If you lose a character in battle you may retry the turn for one death on your party death counter, or restore to the previous rest point for the cost or 2 deaths on the counter.<br><br><br>Some tips:<br><br>A common complaint about the game from the start has to do with managing your spirit points, sp for short, which is how all but basic attacks are used in game. The two brothers that make the game have done a LOT to improve that experience, the two primary ways being more campsites to restore hp and sp, and sp drain gear which gains sp back for your character based on the damage you do to enemies. If you're not interested in the meta strategy and game of managing your sp, then note: character buffs expire faster on higher difficulties due to increasing fixed turn cost of ending combat, and so you'll use sp faster - It's worth playing on easy 'til you start to get the hang of it. So that way it's less a concern needing to gain sp drain gear or returning to known camp sites for restoring hp\/sp. You can also rearrange party order now! A much wanted QoL and positioning strategy improvement.<br><br>The 3 essentials: Defense (D or def.), Accuracy (acc) and Damage (dmg). You're pretty much never going to beat a combat in a single round, so you need enough hp\/soak and\/or avoidance skills\/gear to survive at least one round of combat - In this game avoiding hits by reducing enemy action points (ap for short), reducing enemy acc, staying out of enemy range and\/or buffing your parties dodge\/parry tends to be most efficient, but high character hp and armor plus dmg cursing enemies and healing your party works too- high hp and avoidance\/soak are needed for the hardest hitting enemies. Accuracy: if you can't hit something you'll never win, buff acc and\/or curse enemy dodge and parry. Damage: If you can't kill something because it's armor is too high or it heals too fast you won't win battles - If you use low damage attacks\/weapons then you'll need to curse enemies armor and\/or resistance (resist is armor vs magical damage). All damage has a physical component, but there are four elemental magical damages that the mystic's spells or certain items do, and some enemies have those to harm your characters with as well, especially later in the game. Finally there's holy damage your party can do to enemies via some healer attack talents and items any party member can use, or conversely, enemies can do unholy damage to you.<br><br>As a general rule character buffs and cursing enemies is more sp efficient in the long run than sp costly attacks, but that varies somewhat with attack type and its cost and what your party and characters need to help improve their effect in combat.<br><br>Range: Not essential, but highly useful, particularly for keeping vulnerable characters safe, so having ranged support buff\/heals, enemy curses or attacks is recommended until you get pretty experienced. An all melee team also practically limits some of your character choices.<br><br>Area of Effect (AoE): Again, not essential, but it really makes a lot of battles go faster where there are enemies which spawn other enemies or any fight where enemies tend to cluster.<br><br>Empowered attacks: Usually only raise one after leveling other wanted buffs and curses so long as the essential are met for best use of your limited talent points - there may be exceptions, experiment if you want ;)...<br><br>Note: pick locks doesn't ever need to go above level one.<br><br>There's way more expert advice on their forums...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29135966', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29135966' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29135966\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29135966' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29135966\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29135966', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29135966_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29135966_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29057267\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198264588637\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"304322909\">vlemsjef<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 291.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat game.

What a great game!  This is a must-have if you like these types of games.  Heroes of Steel puts the Tactical in tactical turn-based RPGs.  With constant developer support and responsiveness, bugs are non-existent and the gameplay experience keeps getting better and better with more content and constant user-suggested improvements.  Refreshing to say the least.<br><br>As for the gameplay....outstanding.  I love these types of old school games.  Graphics and soundwise, that's what this feels like.  Almost nostalgic.  However, don't let that fool you, this game is very current and plenty sophisticated in its combat-oriented content.  You truly are the difference in winning and losing battles.  Your positioning, movement, order of attack, buffs, de-buffs, spells, etc...make all the difference in almost every battle.  If you get careless, you get hurt.  If you pay attention, you can still get hurt but you should be able to implement a strategy to win and advance and it's very satisfying.<br><br>Speaking of advancing, this is one of those games where you just can't wait to level up and get the next Talent\/Skill\/Attribute point(s).  The building of your characters is probably the coolest and most important part of the game.  Four unique and distinct characters need to be built as a cohesive and synergistic team in order to survive and excel.  Each character has many different ways it can advance and they each can perform multiple functions, BUT (and it's a big but), they need to all work together.  Each has talents that can help the overall team in different ways and each has individual talents to help themselves.  How you choose to use each character is completely up to you but, again, they need to all work together.  Combat is challenging at best and extremely difficult at times so working as a unit is pretty much imperative to long term success.  <br><br>To that effect, a great feature is the re-spec button.  Each character gets one chance during the game for you to reset his\/her entire build to fit what you're trying to do.  This is fantastic since with all of the options you have, you can play through pretty much the entire first episode and learn the game, then figure out what works, what doesn't, what you're missing, what you need, what you didn't use, etc...and fix it without having to start over from the beginning.  Huge plus in my book because Ep 1 can take anywhere from 30-60 hrs by itself.<br><br>Which leads to content.....lots and lots of content.  It's mostly fighting with just enough story to make it immersive.  The real rewards are the feelings you get for taking down a nasty boss, levelling your characters and getting new talents with which to play, and finding a new piece of gear or a shiny new weapon with all those enhancements....yes!  :-)  4 Episodes with lots of levelling.  Characters can achieve a max of level 65 I believe (I haven't got that far yet so don't quote me but I think I read that in the forums somewhere).  Or you can just spend hours building and re-building new groups and playing through Episode 1, testing and trying out all of the different talents and strategies available to you.  Both are fun.<br><br>In conclusion, I've played a lot of RPG's in my day and this is one of the best I've ever played.  It seems I'm almost always looking for that game that can keep me up until four in the morning for &quot;one more turn&quot;.  This is it.  Worth every penny of full price and literally a complete no-brainer if its on sale.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28585731', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28585731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28585731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28585731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28585731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28585731', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28585731_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28585731_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28307326\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198320452402\/recommended\/291190\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"360186674\">allino<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\ti think, that it is super game.
