I grew attached to the protagonist Ronan O'Connor fairly quickly, especially as you begin to uncover clues about his past. I bought everything the developers sold me about the &quot;ghost realm&quot; and how it functions (such as there being consecrated &quot;obstructions&quot; that ghosts can't pass through - perhaps not the most realistic idea to some, but considering we're dealing with a video game, I found it to be a very reasonable and clever excuse to keep the player's area of exploration streamlined but not restricted). The way that one investigation would lead to the next felt natural and smooth. Towards the end of the game I started to grow fearful that I would be disappointed by the conclusion, but I absolutely was not. From start to finish the plot was well-thought out and brilliantly executed.<br><br>The worst part of this game to me are the demon-hunting sequences. In all fairness I've never been much for destroying enemies, but even moreso than usual I found them to be an annoyance. Luckily individual demons follow their own path on a loop, but when there's more than one to an area it can become much trickier to get the timing right. Really, though, it just takes a lot of careful planning and mapping out your steps in advance.<br><br>Otherwise, for negatives, the autosave feature is a bit of a pain because I had to leave the game up &amp; running at all times until I finished. That is, you cannot save your game on your own time, the game chooses when to save FOR you. So then if you exit &amp; reopen the game, you'll be started back at the beginning of the last area you entered instead of specifically where you left off. Also, there are some parts of the game where you have to select the &quot;most useful&quot; clue(s) and while I got most of them easily, there were a few where the logic was simply lost on me.<br><br>The 38.9 hours I spent on this game only accounts for 1 playthrough - I know the average person doesn't take NEARLY as long to finish, but I'm a born-again explorer and spent a ton of extra time scanning the environment in every direction, every corner, every wall I could pass through and even revisiting areas I'd already been to in case I missed anything. So if you enjoy being thorough like me, it is possible to make this game last a long time which adds to its value.<br><br>Also, there are multiple occasions where you can play as a cat.

Now he must figure out who his killer is with the help of a young girl, and the abilities to investigate crimes and possess people. He can't move on until he finds out truth....<br><br>This is a really fun horror game without the jump scares. It does have a creepy atmosphere, but there's nothing particularlly scary about it. I loved how the invesitgations are set up, how you can search for clues, and I love possessing people to hear their thoughts. If you gather enough clues you can even hear &quot;ghost&quot; stories, and even help fellow ghosts. The stories are well written and thought of. I don't usually like going around collecting items, but I didn't mind in this game so much. The only thing I would possibly change in the game is the annoying demons that you have to avoid and banish. I realize that most people like their games to be challlenging but I hate &quot;stalking&quot; my enemy waiting for the perfect moment, only to foil it and have to restart from the latest checkpoint. <br><br>Overall, the game was entertaining, medium length, and well written. Investigations are fun and not too difficult.

I think the ending was worth the time. Also, it's fully dubbed into Spanish, which is great.<br><br>Now, I would only recommend buying this game on sale (it's 3\u20ac now at some sites, which is quite fair). The puzzles are basically &quot;Mysterium&quot; in a nutshell, which means they sometimes make sense, and some other times you just random-click through all of the clues until you get them right cause they make absolutely no sense except for the guy who made the game lol.<br><br>Some people find demons stupid. I think they're a nice touch. Repetitive, indeed, but they create some sort of fear that you wouldn't feel without them, cause you never know when &quot;exactly&quot; they are gonna pop up (but you can mostly guess). Most ghost hiding places are unnecessary, though, since you won't ever use them at all.<br><br>Collectibles, collectibles everywhere. I found most of them naturally because I inspect all the stages before moving on with the story, so that I don't have to interrupt it later on to find them. I missed all the graffities, tho. Had to find them with a guide. No idea how to find all of them otherwise, except by luck. IMPORTANT: make sure you find everything before Judgement House. Otherwise you will be unable to do it later on, since the game locks you out of the city at the end (no free-roam after the credits).<br><br>NPCs are repetitive as hell. Mind reading is useless, since they all think pretty much the same things. Ghost teleportation and possession come in handy in few occasions for the plot, and that's about it. Also, there are only like 5 side missions, and the most interesting one was the first one at the apartment.<br><br>On the bright side, you can possess cats, xD. <br>Press Y to meow.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30361133', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30361133' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30361133\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30361133' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30361133\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30361133', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30361133_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30361133_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30715910\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112602592\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"152336864\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112602592\/\" data-miniprofile=\"152336864\">eemie4girls<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112602592\/games\/?tab=all\">41 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112602592\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112602592\/recommended\/233290\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">41.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is easily the best game i've ever played! Granted, i am a strickly point and click gamer where there is a distinct beginning and end, and crime stories are definitely my favorite, but with that said, i have never played a game so incredibly clean and well-written. There was only one glitch that i ran into, and it didn't keep me from completing the game. It had to do with a side story, and although i usually like to be thorough in the games i play, i let it go and moved on (i had no choice unless i wanted to start over, which i definitely didn't want to do because i was well into the game). The graphics were amazing, the voiceover fantastic, and the story was intriguing and kept me interested to the very end. And to top it off, the ending surprised me.

Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't.<br><br>It's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. You end up collecting a lot of clues and you have to figure out which ones will help you solve whatever crime you're working on. They make sense and its fun. I've noticed a few negative reviews saying the clues don't make sense and you end up just clicking on everything till you get it right. I only did this once at the beginning of the game...and all I can say is, try thinking a bit and paying attention before just mashing your mouse. If you do this, you'll pretty quickly get a feel for how the clues work in the game and figure out which ones are useles. You can also posess the living, and while you can't move them, you can help them remember and eavesdrop on their conversations or thoughts. You can, however, posess cats which allow you to reach places you can't reach on your own. Everything about the game makes sense...you can't walk through the outdoor walls of buildings that have been consecrated, the demons you have to sneak past to take down from behind are souls who never passed on, etc. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.<br><br>Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, gameplay is fun, voice acting is well done. Having finished the game now, the story is a pretty good detective story, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: the graphics aren't the best, but they're still decent (especially the lip synching); sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. However, all these are definitly worth overlooking.<br><br>The other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough. Its up to you to decide whether a 7-10 hour game is worth $60 or if you want to wait for a sale.<br><br>In short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery\/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game. Having finished it, I would now give it between a 7 and an 8 out of 10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10336458', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10336458' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10336458\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10336458' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10336458\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10336458', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10336458_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10336458_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t345 of 389 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/recommended\/233290\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">19 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>9 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18419391\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"54500944\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fcb5d81080382451f8524a3a7a61245aedcea674.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fcb5d81080382451f8524a3a7a61245aedcea674.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fcb5d81080382451f8524a3a7a61245aedcea674_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/\" data-miniprofile=\"54500944\">Tom<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/games\/?tab=all\">2,954 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/recommended\/\">402 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Ellywelly_Tom\/recommended\/233290\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMurdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure detective game, which was released in mid-2014 on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One. The game was developed by Airtight Games; which hadn't released anything worthwhile for a while before this game. <br><br>You play the role of detective Ronan O'Connor, based in a town called Salem in USA. The story is based around hunting down a serial killer by the name of &quot;The Bell Killer&quot;. Ronan is killed by the serial killer at the beginning of the game and you are revived as a ghost and must find the killer before he can move on to the afterlife. <br><br>The game is played in a third person view as you wander around the town of Salem, the town is split into a couple of separate areas, such as churches, graveyards petrol stations etc. As you progress through the story, you learn a few different abilities, such as being able to teleport yourself short distances, being able to possess other living beings allowing you to read their minds or being able to influence their decisions in dialog scenes. The main game play element is solving the mystery of the killer; you do this by investigating the crime scenes for clues on the killer, and trying to predict their next move. This takes on a similar way of doing things as games like LA Noire has done; in that you have to find specific items of evidence scattered, and sometimes hidden around the crime scene in order for you to put them all together in order to resolve the scene. This can lead to quite a few moments of where you need to study all the evidence put in front of you in order to solve it giving it a real detective vibe. <br><br>On top of these detective scenes, there is a small element of combat in the game - as you are a ghost, living humans are not able to detect you; however the demon souls of the death world can. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key sequences in a small QTE - these combat scenes are very few and far between however and aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story. <br><br>Visually, Murdered: Soul Suspect looks nice. The whole game takes place in the time frame of one evening, so the darkness of night gives the game a very eerie feel to it. It doesn't have ultra-realistic graphics, but all of the characters are well animated. There are a couple of poor quality textures, however given that this is a sort of open world game, this can be forgiven somewhat.  <br><br>The story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is something really special. From the opening scene, I was completely drawn into the plot and was able to fully immerse myself in this world being unfolded in front of me. As you progress, you come across other characters who aid Ronan in his efforts to solve the mystery and you grow attached to them too. The story is 100% linear though; there are no game changing decisions which you have to make which disappointed me slightly. But the overall plot which is being shown here is really interesting.<br><br>As this game is being categorized in the horror genre, I would of expected a little more from the sound effects, but I was let down by the fact that there isn't anything really that scary in Murdered: Soul Suspect; the scariest I came across was the demon's you encounter; and even they are tame and the lack of any jump scares or horrifying scenes was a let-down too. Every character you find in the game is fully voice acted to a high quality though. None of the voicing sounds off or cringy which is always a plus. <br><br>I found that there was next to zero levels of difficulty in Soul Suspect; the lack of any real combat leaves this game without any skill element, and is purely based on your ability to solve the crime scenes by finding the relevant clues - I was able to resolve all of the crime scenes with a 3 star rating 99% of the time (you are scored out of three). The hardest point I found has to be due to the game's controls which I will go into on the technical issues section of this review. <br><br>Murdered: Soul Suspect is a vast open world game; you are able to go wherever you want, whenever you want (within reason). There is absolutely tons of stuff to explore and investigate not related to the main plot. There are a number of side investigations you can complete in the early chapters, but these slowly become less and less common as you progress and focus more on the main plot. Another huge part of this game is finding the collectables; this has to be the game with the most collectables in I have ever played - there are hundreds to find.  Each level has its own version of collectable items, and there are also the overall games collectables which unveil even more about the main character's past, and information about the killer. Due to the fact that there are so many of these to find; I felt a little overwhelmed by trying to find them all and just sort of with the approach of picking any up which I come across whilst completing the investigations. <br><br>I finished Murdered: Soul Suspect in just over thirteen hours; this was with doing all of the side investigations, and collecting over a hundred collectables. I also took the time to playout all of the dialog options with all of the characters and spent a lot of time exploring the town of Salem. Sadly though; there is no reason what so ever to play through this game for a second time; you are not able to change the story in anyway nor are you able to ramp up the difficulty simply because there is no difficulty there in the first<br><br>I had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. Firstly I was playing on my high end rig, on 1080p settings and even though the majority of the time the frame rate was over 100 fps, it still felt like it was stuttering at times. I had to play with v-sync off because otherwise this locked gameplay to 30fps which looked horrendous. Cut scenes are also played out in 30fps in the game graphics, which makes the transitions between gameplay and cut scenes feel a little off too. The game's controls during the combat scenes also came across as clunky too; I often found myself not actually completing the QTE presented because it's not clear which buttons you have to press and what you can let go of which meant a lot of running and hiding from the demons due to failed attempts at killing them.  Finally the last issue I had was there are quite a few invisible walls to be found to, these often are in places where you would not expect them, leading to moments where you'll find you are suddenly floating in mid-air because you've walked into a wall and are trying to climb up it - this is something which can affect the immersion of the game and it's a shame that it is still in it given it's been out for well over a year now. <br><br>I am going to recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect; it has an amazing story which you really do need to experience in order to fully appreciate it, and has an original concept. The linear gameplay, lack of any many action scenes, and a couple of technical issues renders me unable to recommend it more than just that, a recommendation to play. The full price of \u00a319, 99 is also slightly over marked too, so you may even want to wait for it to hit the sales before purchasing. <br><br><b><u> Tom's Score Card<\/u><\/b><br>1) Stay away<br>2) Not Recommended<br>3) Only recommended when on sale<br><b><u>4) Recommended<\/u><\/b><br>5) Highly recommended<br>6) This is a must play<br><br>If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I thought it was fun and the story was compelling enough to make me want to finish it. Speaking of the story, however, this main character is easily the dumbest person I have ever encountered in my life, let alone the fact that he's a detective. Ronan didn't die because he was hunting down a murderer, he died because the writers couldn't come up with a good enough excuse for supposedly-respectable police officers to allow this kind of stupidity to act freely in their police department. So they killed him off so that no cops would have to actually deal with how utterly moronic he is. I figured out the story about two and a half hours into the game, and i played a good 5 or 6 hours total to beat it. All along the way, Ronan kept going &quot;Huh, I wonder what this means&quot; when the meaning is so blatantly obvious that a 7-year-old could figure it out, given that this 7-year-old had the utmost basic knowledge on the historical significance of Salem. There was genuinely only one part of this story that surprised me, and even then, it wasn't that impactful because of how upset I was at Ronan for his 6  straight hours of nonstop idiocracy. What really emphasized his stupidity, and I personally find this thoroughly ironic, was when he finally ended up talking with Baxter. Ronan spent the entirety of the game talking about how stupid Baxter is, and when it came down to them actually working together, Ronan had gotten to literally the EXACT same place as Baxter in their search for the killer. Also, overall, Ronan's facial expressions were a huge disconnect. You could tell it was supposed to be a dramatic moment, and Ronan still looked like the infant that I think he really is. Except if that infant were 5'10&quot;, had a stubble, and wore a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 fedora. Mechanics-wise, it was lacking, but not in such a way that made it hard. Just somewhat tedious. At one point where Ronan should be hauling \u2665\u2665\u2665 across all of Salem, he's instead jogging briskly, taking detours because of how confusing the map is. The teleport mechanic comes in handy, I guess, but honestly it would be so much better if it were just a set distance that you could sorta spam to move faster, instead of having to hold left click, wait for it to charge, and let go, only to travel a repeatedly disappointing distance. Trying to get from the musem to the church was honestly one of the worst sequences for this. I wanted to care about trying to get to the church as fast as I possibly could, but all Ronan could care about was the brunch he was gonna go have with his dead wife after this was all over, resulting in me wanting to start running down my street so that one of us could feel like they were attempting to go quickly towards anything.<br><br>tl;dr<br>story was predictable, Ronan is a moron, and the controls are meh. 14\/10 would Julia again.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30584108', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30584108' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30584108\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30584108' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30584108\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30584108', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30584108_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30584108_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30572812\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197960931103\/recommended\/233290\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"665375\">caruch2001<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA well done murder \/ detective game, Murdered: Soul Suspect was an enjoyable game overall and is worth getting (on a sale) if you\u2019re into this genre. <br><br>The plot is straightforward. You play as Ronan, a criminal turned detective who is shot and killed by a mysterious man. Your quest is to figure out the truth behind your murder and why it happened. <br><br>Gameplay is mostly good. First off, you play as the ghost of yourself. Therefore, you can walk through most walls and objects which is fun to do. This is carried through the story where characters that are alive cannot see or hear you. You won\u2019t be shooting anyone or have any big action moments. This is story driven first with some puzzles, clue finding scenes and a few small \u201cstealth\u201d parts thrown in. <br><br>The puzzles incorporate clues you just found or found in the past. You use them to answer questions the game asks you. \u201cWhat would help Mary remember?\u201d or \u201cWhat is Joy doing?\u201d for example. The answers are sometimes illogical but you can just guess again.<br><br>Clue finding scenes are exactly what it sounds like. Find all the clues in a particular area in order to figure out what went on.<br><br>Stealth sections are the weak point of the game. Luckily, there\u2019s not many of them and it\u2019s not too hard. There are demons that can float around certain areas or inside buildings. To kill them, you need to go up behind them and execute them with a quick time event. However, the controls for this were not predictable and I died several times because the controls wouldn\u2019t respond how I anticipated. <br><br>The environment, graphics and sound are all very good. There\u2019s definitely a creepy atmosphere that surrounds the entire city. Although, I found that a lot of the characters looked the same and would mistake certain characters for others. <br><br>I thought the voice acting was fantastic. A definite strong point here.<br><br><b>Run the game in 60FPS<\/b><br>+Turn off VSYNC in the game options<br>+Enable\/force VSYNC in the Nvidia Control Panel <br><u>Note:<\/u>Cinematics will still be 30FPS as they are pre-rendered<br><br>One of the biggest complaints I have with the game is the lack of a map. It became frustrating to try and navigate around Salem and forget how to get to certain areas you want to re-visit. The game gives you a navigation marker for your current objective, but that\u2019s it. Throughout my playthrough I was never really familiar with the city. For a game with lots of collectibles, it would have been a great addition. <br><br>I initially tried playing with a keyboard and mouse. It seemed to work fine but when entering the in-game diary, it wouldn\u2019t register me trying to move around. I eventually just used an Xbox 360 controller and everything worked perfect.<br><br><b>Pros<\/b><br>+60FPS (see note above)<br>+Good story<br>+Great voice acting<br>+Well done animations<br>+Creepy environment<br><br><b>Cons<\/b><br>+No map<br>+Stealth combat sections<br>+No save feature, only checkpoints<br>+Puzzles are too easy<br>+Steam overlay doesn\u2019t work<br>+Keyboard\/mouse controls broken<br><br>Even with a few faults, I thought Soul Suspect was a good game and enjoyed playing it. It\u2019s a little short, with maybe 8-10 hours to complete. Even less if you don\u2019t collect the various collectibles. So at the current price of $30, it\u2019s a little steep. Grab this on sale.<br><br><b>7\/10<\/b> Good\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30572812', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30572812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30572812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30572812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30572812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30572812', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30572812_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30572812_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/233290\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 7,104 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30496802","30402311","30488908","30886385","30361133","30715910","30699249","10336458","18419391","13363482"]}
