While they ported their games to the consoles, it seems they decided they also needed a game just for the home systems, and so Bare Knuckle \/ Streets of Rage was born. This trilogy of games was highly popular on the Mega Drive and is considered great even now. The games did receive a fair bit of censorship when coming to the west, with the 3rd game losing a boss and secret playable character, as well as receiving a much different story. While Sega never made a 4th game for the series, fans have created a fan game called Streets of Rage Remake which is worth checking out. Well, enough history, time to talk about how it all started.<br><br>Story<br>Gangs own the city. Corrupt officials and cowards prevent the problem from being solved. Three officers quit the force, go vigilante and move forth to beat up some punks. Sound familiar? It should do, most games in the genre had a story just like this.<br><br>Presentation<br>Graphically, this game is okay. However, if you have already played the later games in the series, you will notice that the art style in this game was different, with both player characters and enemies looking different. The style in this game is fine, but I prefer the later designs.<br><br>Now the music, that is damn awesome, as should be expected from the series. Some truly memorable tunes during the levels, that helped cement this series as proof that the Mega Dive can output some good music with its hardware.<br><br>The sound effects however, aren't so great. Some basics yells, screams, thumps and dings. Rather uninspiring.<br><br>Controls<br>The emulator used for this and other games in the Sega Mega Drive Classics supports use of a keyboard, but I highly recommend a gamepad if you own one. Easier to control that way.<br><br>Anyway, the game controls well, not going to have any difficulties performing the attacks and moving around.<br><br>Gameplay<br>When starting the game, you have the choice of three characters. Adam, who moves slower than the other two, Blaze, the weakest of the trio, and Axel, who just can't do a decent jump kick. Minor differences between the three, really.<br><br>When it comes to the combat, there isn't much to say. Walk right, punch everyone a few times, then move on. Much as with the story, you will already know what to expect. This game is all about beating up the nameless thugs that get in your way. Your character was unable to perform any special move themselves in this game, but you are able to call in support from a police officer who will fire a weapon to take down any enemies currently surrounding you. This has a limit of one use per level though unless you find a pickup for more. Outside of that, you have all the genre standards to take down your enemies, punching, kicking, knives, baseball bats and metal pipes.<br><br>Lifespan<br>Other than replaying this on a higher difficulty, the only other extra in this game requires a second player. Late in the game, you will be able to unlock a bad end by having each player choose differently when asked a question. Nothing special really. On the bright side, it actually had support for co-op, unlike Final Fight.<br><br>Well, all said and done, while this game isn't as great as either of the following titles in the series, it was still fun back when I first got to play it on the Mega Drive. It just doesn't do so well in comparison. It was still the birth of a great series, and for that, it deserves my praise. If only Adam got to stick around for the later games.<br><br>7 \/ 10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9165273', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9165273' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9165273\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9165273' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9165273\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9165273', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9165273_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9165273_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/recommended\/71164\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14943132\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"5184901\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bb253683ce7bdd779b0605af474b265bfd5f13af.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bb253683ce7bdd779b0605af474b265bfd5f13af.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bb253683ce7bdd779b0605af474b265bfd5f13af_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/\" data-miniprofile=\"5184901\">SileNce<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/games\/?tab=all\">742 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965450629\/recommended\/71164\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStreets of Rage defined the scrolling beat 'em up genre of its era. Having played the original countless times on the SEGA Megadrive since the age of 3, I was extremely delighted to find the port to Steam. The gameplay is just as good as it was back then, bringing a fantastic feeling of nostalgia. I used to play the game with my twin brother and my Dad as a kid, providing an amazing local co-op experience. Replaying it with a friend brought back many memories as I relived my childhood on the Streets of Rage.<br><br>Pros:<br>+ Simple controls<br>+ Local co-op<br>+ Gamepad support (I used a PS3 controller)<br>+ A feeling of nostalgia<br>+ Pixel art graphics (I love them)<br><br>Cons:<br>- Too easy to accidentally grab your co-op partner<br>- Still contains some glitches (was thrown by both wrestler bosses at the same time on Stage 8, throwing me out of the screen and completing the game)<br>- I disliked the level design of Stage 6 where squashing machinery takes up too much space on the screen making it annoying to fight in.<br><br>Score: 7\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14943132', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14943132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14943132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14943132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14943132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14943132', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14943132_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14943132_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary1189356\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LtLabcoat\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"28561558\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64518c5f384f3d64b3ac46dc6daf58aa8eb678b0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64518c5f384f3d64b3ac46dc6daf58aa8eb678b0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64518c5f384f3d64b3ac46dc6daf58aa8eb678b0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LtLabcoat\/\" data-miniprofile=\"28561558\">Lt.

Final Fight on SNES was 1 player only, so it wasn't hard to be cool despite having smaller less impressive sprites. SoR is known as Bare Knuckle in Japan and it was developed by Sega AM7 team in Sega of Japan. At least it's probably same people who made Revenge of Shinobi, since it reuses some sounds from there.  Released on 4 Megabit ROM, quite standard for it's time.<br>Sega also made Game Gear and Master System versions back in time. They are nothing to talk about, just worsened\/cut around. On other hand, quite recently they released 3D Streets of Rage for 3DS, which adds 3D and some easy modes. That one is superior version.<br><br>The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.<br><br><br>Now, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:<br>The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for &quot;Sega Mega Drive &amp; Genesis Classics&quot; game that should appear in your library.<br>By default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.<br>It's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.<br>However, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.<br>As alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in &quot;uncompressed ROMs&quot; folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being &quot;STREETS_W.68K&quot;.<br>I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to &quot;manuals&quot; folder of game root and open &quot;08 SOR1_PC_MG_EFIGS_US_v6.pdf&quot;.<br><br>While the game has multiplayer mode for two players, the emulator doesn't have any online function for that, so it's local only.<br><br><br>Not unlike Final Fight, the plot is about people on revenge going to beat up punks and criminal syndicate that have taken over the city. Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding, who are around ~22 age old ex-cops, are ready to put order back in. While being helped by a cop who has access to heavy equipment, who can be called as a special screen-clearing attack, making him shoot from bazooka at the area. And yea, you have limited amount of usage for that. Actually, it seems that they reused the sprite for police car from ESWAT ending. So in my headcanon these games are related!<br><br>Setting is kinda similar to Final Fight, but it's seems to be, well, how do I say, romantized. The action always takes at night, you see lights in background of the nameless city that you don't even know the edges of or the full picture of it. And the music is absolutely top-notch. It's club music, written by Yuzo Koshiro, proving that sound chip in Sega Genesis really rocked. Screams are sweet.<br><br>You can select between three characters. They are set up so Axel isn't as good at jumping, Adam is slower and Blaze has lesser attack power. They all have the same playstyle, at least there is no difference in moves that they can pull off, unlike later games. However, you will still will notice some other differences, such as Adam having the most range with pipe weapons or Axel not being able to throw away enemies as far.<br><br>The gameplay is, of course, a beat-em-up. As usual, you can move up-down, as in, deeper into camera direction or opposite, while being able to attack only left and right. It's pretty much a beat-em-up of Final Fight school. Moving in\/out-depth for avoiding isn't as important as it would be in previous games of this genre, for example. It's all due to attack collision being this much wider, but the AI of enemies allows a more straight-forward approach as well. Not to say that it such avoiding doesn't work, just comparing. AI of enemies in SoR1 isn't too simple, but possible annoying, as they often keep distance out of your range, taking some time before approaching you. Don't bother trying to get them outside of the edge of a screen, the attack collision doesn't work there.<br><br>Oh yea, and of course when you get close to the enemy you automatically grab them. After that you can punch them few times. Or throw them back with back+punch, even though this one sometimes just makes you ungrab and walk away. Or you can smash their head against ground from behind, the most powerful move. And thrown enemies knock others, which does good damage.<br>Also, all yay for some levels having pits. Pre-last level is just an open lift. It's a blast!<br>There aren't any much of special moves otherwise.<br><br>And yea, and there are weapons that you can pick up. What I love about the first Streets of Rage is that unlike the second one you don't lose them when you try to grab somebody and unlike the third one their \u201chealth\u201d consists of \u201cyou can drop them from being knocked out 2 times before they disappear\u201d instead of being limited by usage amount. It feels so awesome to be good enough to bring weapons all the way to the boss fight!<br>Oh yea, and there is no way to throw weapon. There is a knife, which does great damage and it can be thrown, but the game decides when to do it by itself. I think you need either to be not directly in same line as enemy or be far away.<br><br>If anything, I feel that the main difficulty of this game comes not from regular encounters but from tricky bosses. Regular encounters are usually not too bad, aside from control issues where you want to punch enemy but you are standing over the weapon and pick it instead. Or just grab the enemy due to having too many around. It's all about the bosses .<br>Protip 1: Press Up+Jump when thrown as you are about to land. You will land on your feet without taking damage.<br>Protip 2: Pay attention to shadows of Level 5 bosses as well. It's easier to tell how deep away from camera they are.<br><br>There are also options menu. There are usual controls and sound test. Don't get too addicted to sound test, you still should play the game. And there is difficulty level, which impacts the amount of health that enemies have, damage they do as well. Their amount is also changed slightly. Though the amount of score you get at the end of the level is increased on higher difficulty, which is pretty nice as you get lives for scores.<br><br>The game also has 2 player coop mode. It's one of the beat-em-up where you have friendly fire in coop, so be careful. Actually, the game also adds more enemies and even stationary objects that you can break for goodies. It makes you always fight two copies of bosses instead of one, something that not even difficulty setting does.<br>It even has team attacks. They are related to grabbing your teammate. You either have to throw him away or jump over him forward. These moves aren't easy to hit with, but they do a huge damage on regular enemies.<br><br>There is also a bad ending that you can get only in two player mode. At final boss, where he asks you a question, both players have to choose different replies. After that players will be forced to fight each other, which is fancy. And then the winner still has to answer \u201cno\u201d as per usual about joining organization. And then win the game.<br>Also, never answer \u201cyes\u201d to final boss otherwise, you are just going to be dropped two levels back. Which isn't fun. At all.<br><br>Overall, it sure was an awesome game for it's time.
