Did you put it in the closet? What are you waiting for? Put it on!&quot;<br>I have it on Vanessa! You are standing in front of me! How can you not see me wearing it. <br><br>Vanessa and me decide to explore the resort and we step outside our bungalow.<br>The place doesn't look that bad actually.<br>Then some random guy walks towards us, He's the manager of a surf school and he does the entertainment at the resort.<br>He told us his name is Ringo! But guess what... His name tag is saying Rob! <br>So i know i should never talk to &quot;Ringo&quot; ever again, because he is clearly a liar.<br><br>After &quot;Ringo&quot; left, me and Vanessa decided to look at the beach.<br>Vanessa was so ridiculously slow that i could run to the beach and back to the bungalow at least 10 times. <br>Since i'm a huge animal person i ran towards the first dog i saw. <br>This is also the most fun i had in the entire game.<br>You can walk with the dogs! Yes, for reals! It follows you, it's so cute.<br>After that i met up with Vanessa who is laying on a towel on the beach. <br>Oh, I have a towel too! Let's lay next to each other and chat like besties do. NOPE!<br>You can't because you can only stare at your towel on the top left. <br>Your stats go up just by having an item in your hot-bar. <br>This is one of the things i disliked the most! What a disappointment. <br><br>Because Vanessa started to ignore me, i got lonely and decided to talk with some other people on the resort.<br>This one guy wanted me to buy him a newspaper... Seriously? I don't even know you! What makes you think i buy you stuff? Then a different guy wanted me to get him a drink... You got to be kidding me. <br>I accidentally talked to that guy again and he got even more rude by saying &quot;I did ask you to bring a drink of juice to me, I'm waiting!&quot; <br>What did you say to me? I'm not your slave!<br>After that i met a creepy Rastafari who clearly has bad intentions. <br>He knew i was on vacation without my parents! <br>I answered with something like How did you know?<br>He said &quot;I see the sparkle in their eyes, it's your first time being free from your parents&quot; <br>God, I'm going to lock my door tonight and barricade it with everything we have inside our bungalow.<br><br>I ran off and met the future &quot;boyfriend&quot; he said everyone on the resort gets a tour!<br>I wanted to go on the tour together with my bestfriend Vanessa.<br>When i asked him if Vanessa could join he made clear Vanessa was NOT welcome. <br>He wanted me to come alone. I don't know this guy and I'm at a resort filled with crazy people. <br>Of course I'm not going.<br><br>Instead i decided to go to a club. <br>The clothes i had were not good enough so i bought an expansive new outfit to enter.<br>The person at the door also told me he would put me on the VIP list.<br>I entered the club and guess what? There was a bartender and 3 other people sitting on a couch.<br>No one was dancing. It was the worst party ever so far.<br>I walked towards the bartender to order some cocktails to loosen up. It's vacation after all! <br>Apparently Alcohol isn't allowed on this resort! Because the strongest drink i could get was a glass of milk.<br>I got a glass of water and thanked him with my manly voice. <br>My character is female but i often set up a manly voice for no reason.<br>People at the resort don't know how to dance either, I figured this out the next day when i took some dance lessons.<br>Dancing is not that easy and clearly not for everyone.<br><br>Anyways, This is a game that you shouldn't take too serious. <br>Don't expect too much!<br>For me it was just one of those games i wanted to have just for the sake of having it.<br>Do i recommend buying this game because it is so good? No...<br>I just give it a thumbs up because i didn't think it was as bad as others said it was. <br>I laughed a few times playing this as you can see. <br>10 euro is too expansive for this game and you should definitely not buy it for that price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30595819', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30595819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30595819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30595819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30595819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30595819', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30595819_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30595819_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/595160\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30595819"]}
