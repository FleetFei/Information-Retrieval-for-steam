WOULD FANNYPACK AGAIN <\/span><\/span><br><br>WASTED is a FPS perma-death RPG dungeon crawling shooter with a post-apocalyptic\/retro  theme set in the 80\u2019s, think of a combination of fallout new vegas\/borderlands with additional dungeon crawling elements.<br>You are (randomized character name) and you are one of the drunkards who drinks booze for buffs and perks throughout his adventure for more booze in the underground coolers (vaults) <br><br>Pro\u2019s<br><br>+Original radio music<br><br>+Unique loveable characters<br><br>+Wide variety of weapons and customizations<br><br>+Fast gunplay, gameplay and replay value<br><br>+Randomized dungeons (coolers)<br><br>+Permanent perks and separate short term dungeon buffs<br><br>+Humorous dialogue: The dialogue stays somewhat close to home with Fallout with a sort of hilarious, twisted and bizarre, but relatable sense of humor (While not to dark) having silly, but strangely loveable characters.<br>My personal favorite so far being Val Killmore the total bro dude<br><br>+Good voice acting<br><br>+Unique game play elements and strats you can use with them <br><br>+Pop culture references that are actually relevant and funny <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> NOT JUST GENERIC COPY PASTE MEMES <\/span><\/span><br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> +Really cool dev (Don\u2019t know if I should count this as a pro, but he\u2019s really cool and responsive to suggestions and ideas on the community hub, and seriously sounds like a guy I would want to down a few radioactive drinks with) <\/span><\/span><br><br>Neutrals<br><br>Art style: The art style I personally find visually pleasing, but most likely will vary player to player<br><br>Semi-permadeath (you keep missions you were doing and can buy back special one of a kind items you lost your previous life but besides that, RIP items that you didn\u2019t store safely at your house)<br><br>The S.O.B Purifier: High level enemy that follows you with a minigun when you take <span class=\"bb_strike\"> too long <\/span> AGES in levels, I personally don\u2019t mind it and I think it changes up the gameplay, but others have complained about it on the discussions before.<br><br>RNG Flasks: Let me explain, there are 2 kinds of drinks in the game, Flasks and Beers. When you drink a beer you get a hangover (a permanent perk) that carry\u2019s over with you for the rest of the game (In some cases you can remove it) downing a beer to avoid death to make it back out of the cooler is a cool and safe strat to do if you\u2019re about to die, even if you get a negative hangover (IE: +10% Melee damage taken from enemies) The beers are cool in my opinion, but the flasks, THE FLASKS\u2026.<br>The flasks either carry positive, neutral, or negative buffs; but always seems to work against you in the end, either screwing you over, or giving you some lucky god tier runs. I\u2019ve had to drink beers and get hangovers that are barely beneficial or just debuffs. I\u2019ll type out a couple of examples of them<br><br>+Hairy feet: +3 Sneak  <br>+Unbearable: Bear traps only deal 50% damage<br>+Trappin\u2019: Bear traps no longer stun you<br>+Heavy Knuckles: +3 Hit<br><br>\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Bricks: A brick spawns on enemy corpses per kill<br><br>-Big Feet: -5 Sneak<br>-Soft Knuckles: -5 Hit<br>-Half life: Max hp halved Nice science joke btw<br><br>See the trend here? It\u2019s like this for all of the characters buffs you gain from the flasks, the positive buffs are WAY outweighed by the negative buffs, while the positives give +3 to a stat the negatives give -5 to a stat; not to mention some of the positive buffs are BEARly beneficial <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> see what I did there? <\/span><\/span> <b> While the negative buffs can easily screw you over. However, the game never requires you to drink them, and has a confirmation popup that asks if you really want to drink this crap, so I\u2019m letting this slide under the neutral section <\/b><br><br>Con\u2019s<br><br>-Unfair Randomized dungeon rooms: Sometimes the game will give you rooms with locked doors, some of the time you opening them can get you killed by some really silly ways. (My favorite so far has been dying by opening a locked door, being welcomed to a shotgun trap that triggers, blasting me in the face along with mutant freak men that open fire on me with assault rifles ending in my death)<br><br>-Enemy\u2019s bullets and projectiles have WAY to much knockback<br><br>-Bad voice acting\/quality: Most of the voice over\u2019s are spot on and really deliver perfectly, but some characters voice over\u2019s seem somewhat low quality (Not god awful, but enough to notice and be irritating)<br><br>-Frames Per Second: This only happens to me on the outside hub areas (where you don't fight at) but is still annoying none the less, while not too bad it still makes my FPS go from 80 FPS in cooler to 35-50 Outside.<br><br>I got this game 4 days before the launch and time I am writing this at (6\/7\/2016) from the Humble Monthly subscription (12$) after originally only subscribing to get Rocket League from the group of games, WASTED has been my favorite from the group, and I\u2019ve honestly had a blast playing this rage inducing masterpiece, and wish there were other games like it out there. Everything about it seems planed out and works together well enough to support its ridiculousness and silly story that you actually find yourself slowly interested in it. So far this is my favorite game of 2016.<br><br>TLDR: <br>Wasted is a post apocalyptic rage inducing joy ride shooter with loveable characters, cool guns and some good laughs<br><br>I never write reviews, but since I got to play this game early, along with the fact there are no public reviews <b> I give WASTED 8.5\/10 <\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23436336', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23436336' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23436336\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23436336' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23436336\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23436336', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23436336_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23436336_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25093745\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"104417192\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b3\/b3a3b641b9bd8456df5777a601594d7151453e4e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b3\/b3a3b641b9bd8456df5777a601594d7151453e4e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b3\/b3a3b641b9bd8456df5777a601594d7151453e4e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/\" data-miniprofile=\"104417192\">The Professional Gibus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/games\/?tab=all\">300 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/recommended\/\">27 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nevergiveuphope\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">46.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWelcome to 1980. Welcome... to the end of the world. All of the inteligent people died. The stupid lives.<br><br>WASTED is... many things. That being a Fallout-esque Borderlands-looking Rogue Legacy-progressing Teleglitch-randomising Spelunky-paced and overall unique rogue-like game. WOW THAT'S A LOT OF WORDS<br><br>And now, for an actual review:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The intro probably left you bonkers, so let me explain that for you: oh, uhm... I actually don't know where to start. How about the premise.<br><br><\/li><li>The whole thing the game's got running for it is that by the end of the year 1980 a nuclear holocaust happened between the communists and America. To prevent the population from dying, the so called &quot;coolers&quot; were created as a shelter against radiation. Everything is done ala Fallout style so far. However, there's a twist! All of the people in the cooler ended up drunk! So when the earth became repopulable again, everybody was stupid! They drank all the booze they could find, injected everything that was sharp in them and the currency for trading became TP(short for TOILER PAPER), which I have to agree with TotalBiscuit, it actually makes more sense than the Bottlecap currency in Fallout.<br>Perhaps you heard about a world where everyone's an idiot, but this game is the first one to put it on paper and it does its job perfectly.<br><br><\/li><li>And before talking the gameplay aspect, you must think that the story must be weak or mediocre. Now you'd be surprise when I say it... IT'S NOT! It's actually got a good solid story! The world and atmosphere is depicted as you can expect it to be, with wasters(game's pick on wastelanders) spewing non-sense out of their mouth and everything that shines is worth one million more than the second thing that doesn't shine. Now for the story I actually don't want to spoil ANYTHING whatsoever, so I'll just leave that be for now.<br><br><\/li><li>So, the gameplay. Starting right off the bat, your goal in this game is to get drunk. How do you get drunk? By going in a cooler, of course. The coolers are essentially the rogue-like aspect of this game, in which the map of every floor is randomly generated. And for the most part you'll be spending time exploring all the loose ends until the big scary minigun guy gets ye', which will get to that in a second.<br><br>The gameplay in itself is an actual RPG with many FPS elements. You hear that Fallout 4? I said actual RPG, Google it. Anyway, the RPG consists of the loot you find across, which is surprisingly diverse, which again, we'll get to that in a bit, and the charm that makes you the drunkard of the wastes, your <span class=\"bb_strike\">S.P.E.C.I.A.L.-<\/span> S.H.O.T.S.. These are special attributes that change your gameplay, and it's pretty significant. This way, you can actually do multiple playthroughs trying different styles, like laser weapons, melee berserk, gun nut etc. Unlike Fallout however, stats not only can be increased, but they can be decreased as well, meaning you can do literal negative damage at its worse of times. What makes this so worthy of giving a mentioning is how stupid some things can devolve to, which is better to be experienced on your own skin, really.<br><br>I have talked about how it's so close to Fallout. Now how about Borderlands? You have 2 ways of playing the game: one being where you are a purist and try to stay as sober as possible, or drink all of the booze possible, turning you into God.  The farming of the drinks is surprisingly addicting. And fun. As you go deeper into the cooler, better drinks start to show up, and you won't believe how many of them are there! From simple stat boosts to unique drinks such as &quot;slowing down time in the air&quot; the variety in everything is quite possibly amazing. As an ending point on this topic, the farming is really fun and the rpg play extremely well, with some minor balance issues here and there, but not really worthy of criticizing too hard imho<br><br><\/li><li>The enemies in this here game are represented by a couple of factions, each one having its own characteristics and backstory and specific combat styles. All I have to say is that everything isn't &quot;many but bland&quot;, instead is &quot;few and distinguishable&quot;. In the first cooler you'll see just normal generic raiders, but later find charging laser shooting robots and samurais that leap from wall to wall to get you. And that's just to tease you, oh boy, there's more past this point.<br><br>Oh, and don't you think I forgot about Mr. Miniguy from earlier. If you spend too much time on a cooler, this big duderino beast will come out to kill you, the S.O.B. Purifier. He has 600 hp with good armor and carries a minigun. If you've seen some negative reviews, you've clearly seen alot of 'em talk just about him. This guy is to make sure you play the game at a high pace and you don't take too much time on the floor. Everyone tends to disagree with this mechanic. I, as a potential future game designer, couldn't agree more with it. Listen, before throwing \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 at me, how many of you would just stealth the entirity of the floor without getting in any sort of combat whatsoever? You'd all do that, and the game would turn really boring and repetitive and so forth. With this guy, you're always on your toes, or else your booty might be taken away by this guy. And to be frank with you, this guy becomes a JOKE on later levels! I did a complete farming run, and he couldn't do jack to me! I actually killed him specifically for rifle ammo, which is pretty funny. In all honesty, he should be buffed for later coolers, so he keeps being a challenge to the player instead of an ammo sink. But that's just me and my silly dev dreams. Movin on.<br><br><\/li><li>As a final point, the dailies. These... are <i>the best<\/i> feature in this whole damn game. Now there are a lot more things to be put in this review, but I'm afraid of Steam cutting me short after every sentence I write, so might as well. The daily runs are, well, a run where you start it up daily and compete on the leaderboard, ez pz. Then what's so damn good about them? Is that you start from ground zero and the run keeps on going forever! Well, until you die, anyway. So none of your brought equipment, none of your special booze powers, just you, your skill, and ALL of the enemies of the game mish-mashed together for an ultimate experience. The difficulty is also much tougher than in your average run, as booze now decreases your max hp and enemies can reach ridiculous amounts of health. It's these kind of things that make you say: &quot;only in a daily&quot;. Not only that, but there are many events to happen, there are items you can bring back and use in the base vanilla, and seeing how the devs saw this as a fun and exciting experience, you can even practice them from the main menu at any time! Heck, if you don't like the campaign, I recommend this solely for the dailies! Are just so damn fun!<br><br>tl;dr WASTED is truly, if not one of my favorite games of all time, one of my favorite games of the year and one of the greatest rogue-likes to be released! A unique blend of Fallout role-playing and Borderlands art and humour mixed with a trusty procedural-generated playground makes this a whortwhile experience for anyone interested for an unique world filled of drunkards with guns, mutants, katanas and what-not. I purchased this game at a -25% discount and I regret not buying this at full price, as it deserves each and every penny for every second I spent playing it. Highly recommended purchase at any time, and if you do end up enjoying it, please, make sure to share this game with your friends, as it deserves more popularity and recognition than it currently has, which for most indie game that is how the cookie crumbles, but I really do not want to see this one turn up like that. Thanks for the understanding in advance.<br><br>As for you Mr. Arthur Podunkian, I said this and I'll say it again: hats off to you, you beautiful b@stard.<br>And for you, the reader: this has been your random reviewer on the internet, signing off!<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25093745', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25093745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25093745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25093745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25093745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25093745', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25093745_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25093745_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23750810\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"111133075\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d7a1d2ac9acebd4662066cb3649e62271a242a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d7a1d2ac9acebd4662066cb3649e62271a242a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/49d7a1d2ac9acebd4662066cb3649e62271a242a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/\" data-miniprofile=\"111133075\">Crowesque<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/games\/?tab=all\">181 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/crowesque\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just completed the game 100%. Hopefully there will be DLCs because I'm addicted to the gameplay<br><br>For what this games packs in , it's ridiculously cheap. It could easily go for 30$+ without me feeling anywhere close to ripped off. It is really THAT enjoyable. <br><br>The best way to describe it is a mixture of DOOM (The fast paced shooting) , Fallout (The Coolers and the RPG elements) and borderlands (Art style and humor).  <br><br>The randomly generated coolers will get you wanting to go back so you can get more. It keeps the game quite refreshing even after you've seen all the rooms countless times<br><br>YOU WILL DIE. This game has quite a learning curve. If you're patient enough to complete the first boss, you can easily complete the game. The first cooler is the hardest by far because of the lack of equipment as you go in. Sometimes the randomly generated rooms will create a cheap death (open a door with a shotgun trap right in front of it that blows your brains out), but it will teach you to stay on before and after every move. <br><br>To be perfectly honest, I am not sure if the game has a difficulty curve issue or if it's because of the learning curve, but I found myself struggling and cursing my life out in the two first coolers while the others were a a blast through (a very enjoyable one, mind you)<br><br>Soundtrack is amazing. A bit small, but amazing. I love how the dev took the oportunity to put the spotlight on smaller indie bands. <br><br>All in all, this game is a must have for any fallout, borderlands or rogue like fans. It's refreshing with its mechanics and with how complete it is while it is a huge nod to all the games we love. <br><br>This clearly is a passion project from Mr. Podunkian and It's completely worth the money. I'm genuinely surprised he's not charging more than that.<br><br>I'm looking forward to the updates.<br><br>edit: typos\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23750810', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23750810' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23750810\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23750810' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23750810\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23750810', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23750810_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23750810_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23440914\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10458486\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10458486\">Auburok<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/games\/?tab=all\">670 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/recommended\/\">75 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">45.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is amazing. It's a roguelike where you can actually make a lot of progression, even if you die.<br><br>First off it's a first-person-shooter that takes after Fallout and Borderlands. There's a humorous tone to the game, but don't let the visual fool you: it's brutal. Your character is on a quest to get to the end of the dungeons, called &quot;coolers,&quot; and drink &quot;booze.&quot; A &quot;booze&quot; is a buff (or a debuff, in some cases) that, once drunk, ejects the player from the dungeon with their inventory to their home, allowing them to restart the dungeon from the beginning. Boozes are modifiers for your character that persist until death that add modifiers like increased inventory space, increased ammo capacity or even increased damage when killing enemies in a chain. Along with this, players equip armor, weapons and bags to improve their utility. Upon death, you lose everything and get a new wasterel that stumbles upon a common sight: your abode.<br><br>So, in being a roguelike, death is final. However, your homestead is infinite. The homestead of the player character is something of a progression hub for your gameplay. It acts as a giant storage chest for the characters that end up owning the building. As you go further into the dungeons, you'll unlock new functions for your homestead. Regardless, building up a cache of weapons and equipment every time you egress is a cornerstone of the game. It's an interesting system, in both mechanics and story. You still might lose a powerful character, but your new explorers will benefit from the fruits of your last generation's labors.<br><br>The game is randomly generated, so dungeon layouts tend to be varied in a limited way (tilesets, etc). Your character will have to make their way using stealth, melee and ranged attacks, and some RPG-lite lock-picking. There's a ton of loot, and there's plenty of had choices to make in the game, such as taking unknown &quot;buzz&quot; buff\/debuffs, or if drinking a &quot;booze&quot; bonus is appropriate.<br><br>This game is both excellent and genuinely funny. All &quot;downsides&quot; I could list are purely preferential issues and some minor nitpicks over animations. The gameplay is solid, and I've found myself coming back for more consistently. An excellent roguelike for the increasingly eclectic rougelike collection.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

experaince.<br> Two things to mention First off the Brand of Humor of which Mr. Podunkian has distilled for this game, is so refreshing, it has references and nods to Pop culture without resorting to Meme culture and some what pokes fun at average gaming conventions, such as Customizing your character. which for some of us takes a while, then inevitability death and having to play as Random Wastelanders (you do get a late upgrade to your persistant home to customise), or the lovely Asuka (which I won't spoil) or Himself as a big part of Forums, Second is what this game isn't this is not like fallout or boarderlands, where getting attach to your character or the story matters , I wouldn't call this methodical game of thinking and looting and carefully planning things out.its more of thinking on your toes, knowing to take a risk or not, to fevor pressing forward while being careful<br>This game is a rogue Lite, as comparable to a FPS Splunky or Binding of issac , or tower of guns and ziggurat, but not quite, the standard gameplay loop, is heading into the dungeon like cooliers, watching out for the many things that hurt you, such as jumping on glass, Running into a brick, stepping in toxic puddles, watching out for gun traps,trying to sneak up or catch  the many other booz'ohs trying to gun or beat you down off guard, or let them battle each other, carrying what you absolutly need as your space of carrying items is quite limited, unless you find rad fanny packs, while you have a chance of finding Random flasks to give you perks for that coolier, its a big risk of what you get from making your shoot very high to half life-ing your health, finding the booze that ends the current run and carries your next run with special perks, but the top floor booze is  not always something great, and encourages you to go deeper to find better booze with better perks, as you get better loot , while balancing, eating, which slows you down, unless you take poop pills, while taking any kinda of medication doesn't let you take more than one for quite a while, Mean while you can't just keep popping pills and wait while it safe because the Fun police aka the S.O.B. sends a lone Purifier to each floor , heavly armed and equip to taking out everything in his path to get you, abit very very slowly, the closer he is, the the music changes to que you in how close and they always let you know when &quot;something is hunting you&quot;, which sometimes makes you regret going through Locked doors with better loot and harder enemies as they always have dead ends, so there is the whole risk and reward as the goal is to get to the end floors, not to get the best loot, tho that does help getting to there. there is a way to pass items a very few amount of them to save for your next character or deposting TP (Money) in your home, to make your odds better<br>Conclusion<br> There is so much other content that Honestly running my mouth would take so much longer, I urge you to try this game if your a fan of Rougelite FPS games, the mechanics that Mr. Podunkian has made, makes alot of sense and go around his game. there is alot of debate of what should be optional in terms of having to be rushed by the SOB Mechanic , but I think desipite the argument of Options vs gameplay philophy , he should stick with the later, as this isn't making money or opening to the game to public more, This is the game he made for himself for this niche, it might not be for everyone and thats okay, but to the niche group that likes this stuff, its a Blast.<br>Stay thirsty

this gem of a game if it wasn't in a humble bundle. I'm glad it was. The game reminds me of Borderlands and Nuclear Throne. If they had a drunken night and mated, this would be the product.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Positive:<\/div>+ Funny story and characters<br>+ Borderlands style artwork\/graphics<br>+ Loot and crafting, a lot like borderlands as well<br>+ A lot of guns to choose from<br>+ New, innovative take on a rogue like<br>+ Writing and story are very humorous <br>+ Very good sound. (effects and voice acting are top notch)<br>+ Developer is VERY active in the forums<br>+ Steam Achievements<br>+ Steam Trading cards<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Negatives:<\/div>- When you die you get a random character, it annoyed me because you get a chance to create a character and if it dies it just throws you a random one<br>- Gets a bit grindy, needs more of an open world<br>- I accidentally attacked someone in one of the &quot;safe zones&quot; and enemies continued to attack me even after I left and came back. Had to suicide to complete missions. Refer to first negative.<br>- I think the price should be about $6-7 for this, a definite recommend if you can get it for that price. I got it in a Humble Bundle so I'm not entirely sure what I ended up paying for it<br><br>I personally didn't have issues with the S.O.B. but I can see why people have been complaining. They could add a harder difficulty to include it. They could also add more time until it respawns.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Good Game:<\/div> <b>7\/10<\/b><br><br>I like the game a lot and think it won't ever reach it's full potential in terms of sales, but I definitely recommend the game. <br><br>I still recommend waiting until a sale and picking it up then.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23495787', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23495787' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23495787\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23495787' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23495787\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23495787', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23495787_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23495787_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30102189\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198012704990\/recommended\/327510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"52439262\">Bajatar<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 28.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile Wasted is partially a parody game it definitely has the gameplay to stand on its own. The mechanics are very polished and a lot of fun, whether it's the smooth FPS gameplay or the looting system that doesn't slow you down. There's also a good amount of variety in weapons, enemies, loot and perks.<br><br>Unlike many other dungeon crawlers Wasted is less about chance and more about skill which makes it that much more enjoyable. When I died it was because I was careless and screwed up, not because the game threw a random unavoidable insta-death at me.<br><br>It even made me reconsider the whole big-evil-coming-to-get-you-if-you're-too-slow mechanic, i.e. the SOB Purifier. The game is more fun if you play it fast and loose. If you REALLY want to do something while being chased he can be avoided by running around circular rooms or by distracting him with a brick and sneaking the other way.<br><br>If you're interested in some gameplay <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ErmCmm8rv8o&amp;list=PLWIol4T7LuSionlHJRnis7ne4JALqWlmF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >check out this Let's Play that convinced me to buy the game<\/a>.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30102189', 'recent_short' );

A wonderful piece of first person &quot;roguelite&quot;, WASTED is if Fallout didn't have any &quot;reliable&quot; people survive nuclear fallout, and now everyone is just dumb bar crawlers who are trying to get as drunk as possible. Each cooler is a maze-like murder fest of raiders, mutated animals and creatures, robots, and the ever popular Syndicate of Buzzkills, or the SOB. Take too long on a floor murdering your way through and stealing fanny packs, ammo, junkfood, and whatever fits in your tiny pockets and youll get a nasty minigun toting SOB Badass to murder you in a few seconds flat. However, find your way through enough floors and you will find one of the fantastic boozes, radiated and ready to give you a mutation hangover. Maybe it'll be good, like health back when you kill people, maybe it'll be bad and you'll take more knockback from attacks but move way faster. Which will you chug? Will you get wasted?

Try your best run and make sure to leave good stuff for the next character to use, because you'll be dying a lot.<br><br>At first sight it may remind you of Borderlands, but the similarity is visual only. WASTED is a roguelite, though it does not have the wealth of loot and items that Borderlands or roguelikes usually do. Instead, you will be encountering the same pool of weapons and armour and consumables on every run. This is a game where you won't spend any longer than 2 seconds comparing similar items to choose which to keep.<br><br>This is a conscious choice because for better or worse, WASTED is meant to be a lot more fast paced that your average dungeon crawler (or is it?). On every level of the bunker, if you stay for too long, an overpowered NPC starts hunting you, spurring you to rush the rest of the floor and find the way down or out. It's not too unforgiving - as long as you keep moving at a steady pace, this &quot;purifier&quot; won't catch up to you. Unless the level's random layout throws a couple dead ends and you need to backtrack. Personally I can't stand this forced time limit. Especially since the game keeps encouraging you to deploy traps and use stealth, both of which require time to do right. It's like it can't decide if it wants to be fast paced or not. If we were able to hide from him or trap him, it would make sense - but the purifier just moves inexorably towards you.<br><br>Aside from the dungeon-bunker itself and your ramshackle house where your stash is, there is an outpost where you can pick up a few quests. This aspect of the game surprised me. There are several quest givers with fully voiced conversations.<br><br>WASTED doesn't take itself too seriously. It's got a fun, violent, foul-mouthed edge to it.<br><br><b>What I enjoyed<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enemy infighting, pioneered by Doom. Any group of enemies will start eliminating each other if they shoot each other by mistake.<br><\/li><li>Localised damage on enemies with different effects (arms, head, groin\u2026)<br><\/li><li>The world building, conversations, and enemy barks are all fun to listen to.<br><\/li><li>Buffs, debuffs, and gear-based stat increases make for a light RPG feel<\/li><\/ul><b>What I didn't like<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>That \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Purifier that forces you to rush all the time. Completely goes against the idea of sneaking and laying traps that the game encourages you to do, as well as constantly looting.<br><\/li><li>Poor gunplay and melee. This is an FPS after all, so it's an important part of it, but it feels lackluster.<br><\/li><li>Way too much knockback when you get shot. And if you're up against an automatic weapon, you'll pretty much get stunlocked. There are items to mitigate this, but the default is *too damn high*.<br><\/li><li>Some UI annoyances that get in the way of the fast pace.<\/li><\/ul><br>I'm not very much into roguelikes so I didn't get very far into the game. Everything escalates in the lower floors. Way better weapons, way stronger enemies.<br><br>Thumbs up, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that Purifier, dumbest idea in the game.

Great aesthetic! Holy crap the forced pacing and cheap shot deaths via the Purifier suck! <br><br>The hunter mechanic is a festering boil on an otherwise excellent game. Seriously, I know the developer feels confident in leaving it there but if anything makes me set this thing down for good it'll be that. 90% of the time you can just deal with it by throwing down a mine at the start of a level and maybe pillar dancing it if you get cornered. The other 10% it's a BS death you could do nothing about and is concentrated, weapons grade anti-fun. <br><br>With the bad out of the way, lets get to the good. The aesthetic is great, feels like a cartoonier Borderlands in all the right ways. The UI while a little primitive feeling is overall smooth and doesn't generally get in your way. The combat is fast, fun, and in spite of the limited AI will keep you on your toes. Weapon balance and ammo scarcity feel really good, I'm consistently forced to use weapons that aren't my first choice, but am also rarely disappointed by them. It adds a lot of variety that you wouldn't be organically pushed towards in other games. The lore isn't exposed to a great degree, but what's there is funny and thoughtful and I wanna know more. <br><br>Bottom line, I'd recommend picking this thing up if you're decent at FPS games and like dungeon crawlers and\/or run and guns. It's got excellent bones, and I really hope mod support ends up being finished so this excellent foundation can be elaborated upon and expanded.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29515542', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29515542' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29515542\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29515542' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29515542\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29515542', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29515542_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29515542_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/327510\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 623 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30404494","30332830","30343381","30583139","23436336","25093745","23750810","23440914","23512719","23495787"]}
