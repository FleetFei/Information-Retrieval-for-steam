Perhaps a mobile game would be more your speed?<br>(b) <i>'Not enough Vikings!<\/i>' - Huzzah, Four Realms might be just what you're looking for!<br>(c) <i>'Juuust enough Vikings!'<\/i> -  Well, obviously this was the correct answer, so kudos to you.  'Four Realms' is actually a heck of a lot more complicated with up to 10 swappable characters at a time - but you might want to think about getting it anyway.<br><br><b>Long Version:<\/b><br>Many moons ago, in the days when cassette-playing Walkmen walked the earth, kids collected POGs instead of Pokemon, and Crystal Pepsi was the latest greatest thing, there was an incredible video game called 'The Lost Vikings' featuring three rambunctious vikings who well, got lost, and had to find their way home.  Erik could run and jump, Baelog could fight and shoot, and Olaf the Stout could, um, act like a giant human meatshield.  The innovative gimmick in this game was that you had to solve puzzles, avoid traps and fight your way through baddies while switching between these three Lost Vikings on the fly, using their various abilities to overcome any situation.<br> <br><b>Gameplay:<\/b>  <br>'Four Realms' seems to be designed in the spirit of this classic game.  Your task in 'Four Realms' is to (wait for it)... save the four realms!   In order to do so, you swap control between various magically summoned allies to complete missions.  However, instead of directionally-challenged Norsemen you will be adventuring with a veritable menagerie of magic-spewing and weapon-wielding animals - up to 10 of which can be a part of your personal A-Team.  Whether you want to fly, shoot, swim, burn things, or just be a furry version of Olaf the Stout (tubbily meatshielding for fun and profit), there's an animal or three that will suit your needs.<br><br>'Four Realms' offers literally dozens of playable animal summons (many of which are unlockable extras as you progress), along with various spells which grant abilities or alter the terrain (shrinking things, creating ladders\/bridges, etc) - so the various obstacles you face can be overcome in a number of ways.  The catch is that your spellbook can only hold a limited number of spells per level, so you must choose an assortment of spells and summons that are flexible enough to conquer any situation.<br><br><b>Technical Features:<\/b>  <br>The levels seem designed rather well, with the enemies and obstacles allowing you to get around them in a number of ways, while still feeling like they provide a bit of challenge to get most of your team across.  However, the AI of your summoned team seems painfully nonexistent, especially when ladders or moving platforms are involved - in their attempts to stay by you, allies will blissfully walk into spikes or drown in a 2 foot puddle rather than take the safe path.  Constantly turning the individual 'follow-me' buttons off\/on while you jump\/swim\/fly each of your characters over an obstacle is rather annoying.<br><br>The audio\/visual features of the Four Realms are definitely not a major selling point, although they seem adequate enough to get the job done.   They're about what one would expect from an indie game, really.<br><br><b>Conclusion:<\/b>  <br>Four Realms is a nifty title with plenty of new innovations to the character-swapping, action-puzzling gameplay pioneered in 'The Lost Vikings'.  However, the extra complexity introduced by 'Four Realms' can also greatly slow down the game.  Swapping between a small army of characters and micromanaging each can be a bit frustrating. Add in resource costs (you collect elements throughout each level to cast spells and summons), four different elemental damage types to consider, various spells and enchantments to cast, and the additional bonus effects resulting from your choice of gear, commander, and command tent - and it can all get a bit overwhelming.   <br><br>The complexity of 'Four Realms' may be a turn-off for those looking for a casual puzzling adventure.  However, others may find this adds a nice amount of replayability to an already lengthy game (even the tutorial missions took me over an hour to complete).  'Four Realms' features large, well-designed levels, plenty of character progression and unlockables, a great number of spells\/summons to choose from, and a variety of starting bonuses used as a difficulty setting to make the replayable campaign more challenging.  Additionally, each level is designed to have multiple 'solutions' to get around the obstacles, so if you do decide to play through the game again you can vary up your spells\/summons to get a new experience the next time around.<br><br>All in all,  Four Realms does a lot of things right, but is also far from perfect - it definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea.  So, if the thought of spending a couple hours on tutorial missions for a gussied up 2-D action-platformer makes you cringe, I'd probably start looking elsewhere.  However, if an elaborate strategic action-puzzle-platformer with a huge amount of content sounds right up your alley, you should consider giving this game a try.<br><br><b> 6.5 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Received a free copy for testing\/reviewing purposes.

The game itself visually looks pretty basic and simple making you immedetally jump to the conclusion of the game being pretty basic, but again going back to that quote you'd be wrong. It's a rather complex game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Quick Note<\/div>So I think I just need to start off with this game is definatly not everyones cup off tea, so I would recommend trying out the demo <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/483820\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a> before even thinking about purchasing the game to see if the game is to your liking. Now with that out of the way lets get to the review of the game itself.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Now, Four Realms is a rather interesting game when you start playing it even though it wouldn't seem that way by looking at the screenshots and videos. There are a few problems that I would like to address here as well as some good points about the game aswell.<br><br>The core mechanic of the game is that you are in control of a couple of different characters with their own abilities and spells that they are set with and that you will have to use throughout the course of the game. You are able to switch between these animals through each level and use their specific abillities to progress through the game and get past obsticals that will stand in your way.There is a decent amount of these animals that you can take control of, and that's good for the variety of the game, but for me personally switching between all of these characters kind of takes the pacing of game down a bit. Having to constantly switch between characters can be kinda intimidating especially if you don't know their ability and what type of move they have to get past a obstical.<br><br>One main misconception that you may encounter when looking at the screenshots and videos of the game is that this game isn't like a run in and attack everything that you seen and then move in. The game focuses specifically on <b>tatically\/strategy<\/b> gameplay, again this isn't a bad thing but I feel like it's nessesary to bring this up as people may not understand what type of game this actually is just by looking at the screenshots and videos that are provided.<br><br>On the topic of the game itself, I think that it's safe to say that this game has many mechanics which is why the game itself is rather complex from what it actually looks like from the screenshots and videos provided. Now, even though the game is tagged as a <b>strategy<\/b> game, I feel like sometimes the game feels rather overwhelming with the amount of things that you need to remeber that you have to use throughout the game. I mean having to constantly switch between characters can be kinda frustrating as I have stated previously. I feel like this is also another reason why the game feels slow paced which may put off others to play this game.<br><br>Now even though the game can feel rather slow paced, I think that it's safe to say that the leve deisgns are well done. The placing of enemies makes it so that there is not only one way to get past that enemy but multiple ways to do so.
