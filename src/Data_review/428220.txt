This visually captivating, auditorily pleasing, side-scrolling platformer is what you're looking for!<\/blockquote> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Game Overview<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><b>TurnOn<\/b> is a casual, side-scrolling platformer that conveys a story through stellar audio and visual presentation without the use of words. (Except for the guides and instructions, of course)<br><br>In this game, you control an alien that takes the form of an electric ball and lead it through its journey to restore the light in Electro City.<br><br>The gameplay is pretty simple and straightforward - you traverse through electric lines\/wires and apparatuses which activates and\/or repairs them through contact while collecting blue lightning symbols. Each of these actions will have an impact to the score you will get upon finishing the level. Still seeing people in need through the level? Search again for hidden paths that you might've missed.<br><br>Also, you will find adversaries that might stand either your way or the people living in the city, and some of them require different mechanics in order to be cleared. Though there isn't a game over that could force you to start over, there are still some cases that may halt your progress through the game. <br><br>Falling through the lines and touching the ground will result in you being sent back to your checkpoint, but everything that you have collected are still with you, every apparatus activated, and no damage taken. However, if you exhaust your life bars (represented by the green lightning symbols on the upper left part of the screen) you will restart the level from the start.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Pros<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n    <li><b>Charming, Calming, and Hilarious Gameplay Experience<\/b> - Summarizing the gameplay experience that I felt as I played through the game, it was very calming, charming, and fun experience that I would proudly say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. I mean, I never would've thought that I would see a character in a game crying over not having a cable signal. If that doesn't seem funny enough to you, then I guess you're Jaden.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Artistic Game Graphics<\/b> - The game is very appealing through and through in each of every visual aspect it presents. The landscape and scenery fits the very theme it presents on every level, as well as the visual effects filled in it. The character models are clean and well-animated, along with the comic-strip cut-scenes. And most of all, the aesthetic lightning work in each and every level is impeccable.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Beautiful Game Soundtracks<\/b> - Ranging from serene piano tracks to cheerful up-beat songs, this game has a lot to offer in the auditory department. And when I do say a lot, I really mean it. Each and every level has its own unique track and aside from the cut-scenes and the map soundtrack, almost nothing was ever re-used. Everything is quality-made and the proof of that are the hours I spent listening to the tracks while idling the game. If there is something that is missing, it is the availability of a soundtrack DLC for users to listen and enjoy.<\/li><\/ul> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Cons<\/b><\/u><\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n    <li><b>Irritating Sound Effects<\/b> - Although the game has a pretty good array of soundtracks that is very pleasant to the ears, there are certain sound effects that will make you tone down the level due to discomfort, especially if you're new to the game. A good example of this is when you &quot;respawn&quot; to your checkpoint upon touching the ground. Fortunately, the game lets you adjust the volume of the sound effects. However, the downside is that you might not know other SFX that you're missing to hear.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Hard to Navigate<\/b> - Just to be precise, I am pertaining to the game having no cut-scene skip and absence of the settings menu while you are on a level. Regarding the cut-scenes, you can actually speed them up by continuous left clicks or by spamming the ESC button, however, it still takes at least five (5) seconds in doing that before you proceed to the level. Having an option to skip them would be pretty handy for people uninterested or has already seen them several times. Same goes for the settings, which should be available while in-level instead going back to the main menu just to adjust the volume or video settings.<br><br>    <\/li><li><b>Minor Visual Bugs<\/b> - During the course of my play through (which I could safely assume that I've reached at least one-thirds of the game), I have encountered two minor visual bugs, though take note that these bugs didn't have any impact on my play through. The first one I found was on the end part of the &quot;School Routine&quot; level which involves a speaker still being highlighted in blue even after activating it, and the second one is when you're going through the level selection and passing between the &quot;Bulb Monument Street&quot; and &quot;Unusual Date&quot; levels which shows an empty flat terrain. <br><br><i>Both of these bugs are recorded on my screenshots page here:<\/i> <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rankmenotplz\/screenshots\/?appid=428220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > (Screenshots)<\/a><\/li><\/ul> <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>The Verdict<\/b><\/u><\/div><br>Truthfully, there isn't much of a discussion to this considering that I can't find anything that big of negative aspect could persuade you into NOT buying it (unless you're not into casual gaming). And if you are a fan of this kind of game, I'm pretty sure you will love it.<br><br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rankmenotplz\/recommended\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >reviews<\/a>, or follow our curator group at <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/GoodGamesGR#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Good Games Giveaways &amp; Reviews<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23557374', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23557374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23557374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23557374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23557374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23557374', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23557374_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23557374_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23325252\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/klownkamikazee\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"63327110\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8b78576c201f3756a942f4efa5a7596bc9c489f8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8b78576c201f3756a942f4efa5a7596bc9c489f8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8b78576c201f3756a942f4efa5a7596bc9c489f8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/klownkamikazee\/\" data-miniprofile=\"63327110\">TheKingOfKlowns<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/klownkamikazee\/games\/?tab=all\">401 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/klownkamikazee\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/klownkamikazee\/recommended\/428220\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received TurnOn for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile TurnOn is short, it is still a load of fun. It is host to amazing music, a wonderful art style and a challenging yet fun style of platforming. As you travel around the different locations of the city, turning everything back on again, it is always satisfying to see the effect of your actions. Such as scaring away looters and people who are taking advantage of the darkness to perform bad deeds. The musical sections in which you must travel along a long bridge of power lines in beat with the music are also a nice break in between areas. The game also subtly spreads the message of environmental awarness in a nice and calm sort of way, without sounding all preachy about it. If you are a fan of colourful, cute and musically satisfying games, then TurnOn is the game for you.<br><br>See my full review of the game here at Blot gaming.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.blotgaming.com\/game-reviews\/turnon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.blotgaming.com\/game-reviews\/turnon\/<\/a><br><br>Also see a Let's Play of the game from another member of Blot gaming here.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZG_-exfpMEQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZG_-exfpMEQ<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23325252', 'summary' );

This was a mostly enjoyable experience that took me  4.8 hours to complete. There were a few parts of the game where I got stuck for a little while, which extended my time a bit. A player with solid platformer and runner skills could probably play through this in about 3 hours if they wanted.<br><br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story<\/div><br><br>The story in TurnOn is presented without any captions or voice work. It is a strictly visual experience from this standpoint. That said, it does in fact carry itself reasonably well in the story department. Basically, this is the tale of an alien who crash lands in a city (and fortunately in a scientists laboratory) causing a city wide blackout. The alien, who is represented as a ball of electricity, and who can only travel via electrical currents (such as power lines and such), and the scientist together attempt to restore power to the city before the people in the city destroy it via looting and other crime, accidents, and what have you. You, the alien, will also try to help people along the way, from helping out a couple on a romantic date to making it possible for a kid to finish his round of mini golf (and other stuff as well). Certainly the story in TurnOn is no magnum opus, but it serves well within the context of this platformer.<br><br><br>I give the story a 7 out of 10<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br><br><br>The gameplay in both a platformer and a runner is of paramount importance. Brainy Studios did a very nice job of creating a seamless experience in this regard. The controls in TurnOn were tight using a gamepad (I didnt try keyboard and mouse, so I have no opinion ion that manner of play for this game). I experienced zero crashes or stuttering. There is one amusing bug that will show up however. You can sometimes end up travelling along invisible power lines. This happened probably 8-10 times in my playthrough. Each time, this bug worked to my advantage as it made jumps between power lines a bit easier.<br><br>So, the actual gameplay itself:<br><br>The platforming was fairly basic overall. As mentioned before, in TurnOn, you travel via power lines and electrical currents. These are presented in a number of ways, from straight lines to mazing paths, with shifts in elevation, and moving platforms (such as window washing lifts, the scientists vehicle, forklifts, etc\u2026). There will also be bridges that you need to power up to unlock, doorways that need to be unlocked, street lights that need to be turned on, and so on. Along the way, you collect currents of electricity (which basically take the place of the more familiar coins in platformers) which impact your ranking on each level and are attached to certain achievements. There are also red charges of electricity which damage you and green charges which heal that damage and basically give you up to 3 health points. If you run out of green energy, you will have to completely restart the level you are on.<br>The running sections I personally found to be a bit frustrating. Not because they werent done well. They were. I simply am not so good at that style of gameplay. However, despite my deficiency in this regard, I was still able to complete each level with some trial and error. You are still traveling across electrical lines, and so the presentation for the runner levels is basically like sheet music, with a few different levels and breaks on various ones causing you to have to stay on top of your game and change lines frequently. The pacing is tied to the music in the game, so the faster the tempo, the faster you are running.<br><br><br>You will also encounter enemies on a few levels in TurnOn, which are variations on red energy. They are fairly easy to avoid overall, but you will still die plenty of times on a few of those levels. There is also what is essentially a timed level towards the end. This was the level I had the most problems with overall. Again, it was done well, but I still died a lot trying to figure out and remember the patterns as I ascended a building trying to stay ahead of a line of red energy that inexorably advanced upon my little electrical alien.<br><br>The gameplay in TurnOn deserves an 8 out of 10.<br><br> <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div><br><br>The graphics in TurnOn were are presented in comic book fashion. The intros for each section are actual comic book frames which let you know what challenges you will face in the level to a certain extent and what your overall goals are. The actual game graphics are an extension of this comic book approach. They were especially well done in my opinion and the highlight of TurnOn for me. This was simply put a beautiful and lovingly crafted game from a graphics standpoint.<br><br>I think this game deserves a 9 out of 10 for this category. The graphics in TurnOn were almost done to perfection<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div><br><br>I have mixed feelings towards the audio in TurnOn. The music was the sort of stuff you would expect to hear in inspirational videos and commercials. Sort of uplifting, but also a bit sterile. The rest of the audio was simply sounds of electrical discharge, muttering speech done intentionally to further the voiceless story telling, and other ambient noises appropriate to the various backdrops. This was the low point of the game from my perspective<br><br>6 out of 10<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div><br><br>Taken as a whole, TurnOn was a pleasant gaming experience. The setting and main character were charming. I was also impressed by the fact that this game was crafted by a four person team.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">7.5 aliens traversing the electrical wire ways of our neon world charming the socks off of those they encounter within.

A casual platformer developed by the four man team of Brainy Studio, TurnOn features some great relaxing music, colorful art style, and creative level designs. <br><br>TurnOn is a narrative story told through comic-like cutscenes and during the game\u2019s levels. After a power station accident, an alien becomes sentient by fusing with the power stations\u2019 systems. Players take control of the little ball of alien electricity as it makes it way throughout the city trying to restore the cities\u2019 power. Players travel along the electrical wires throughout the power station, residential, and commercial districts of the city. Players must solve puzzles like helping a little girl get home safely and fighting crime by setting off alarm systems to scare off looters. <br>The levels of TurnOn are wonderfully colorful and dynamic. The power lines allow players to travel seamlessly from the background to the foreground. This gives each level the feeling of being three dimensional despite the games 2D art. What slightly contrasted this great feature was that the electric alien of the game would not change in size when moving from the foreground to background in some parts of the game. It was minor, but it still made the character seem out of place compared to everything else, which would shrink and grow in size as the game\u2019s camera moved back and forth. The game\u2019s puzzles in each level were not overly challenging. It mainly just took a bit of exploring and common sense to realize which power box to jump into to activate more lights or to stop traffic lights for someone to safely cross the street. The slower paced and relaxing puzzle levels of TurnOn were juxtaposed by racing sequences. During these, players would jump between four different wires at a time, trying to collect as many hovering lightning tokens for points, while avoiding falling to their deaths or hitting the red tokens, which when three were hit, you died. <br><br>TurnOn\u2019s art and music were two awesome parts of the game. The lighting in the game feels bright and vibrant due to its contrast with the blackout of the city. The background is painted with a darker color palette of blues and purples, that still give the game a fun and cheerful feeling, without making it feel dark and gloomy. People also populate many of the game\u2019s scenes, usually in distress about one situation or another, all related to the cities\u2019 blackout. This helps the city feel alive, and being able to watch them cheer or enjoy their lives again with your help adds to the satisfaction of completing each puzzle. The music of TurnOn was one of my, dare I say it, turn ons. The casual gameplay and vibrant colors are complimented by the smooth jazz throughout the game. The music during the puzzle scenes adds to the relaxing mood and made this game one of my favorites to come home and play after work. The racing sequences of the game had faster pace music to compliment their gameplay. The developers definitely hit the mark with creating a great atmosphere for their game with the music.   <br><br>TurnOn is a very enjoyable and relaxing platformer that is great for adults and kids. The colorful art style and smooth jazz music fit well together, while the simple gameplay and dynamic level design made it fun. I did run into two bugs during my playing, but both of the them were easily fixed by simply reloading the level from the previous checkpoints and neither occurred more than once. The developers were quick to respond to my email about the bugs, so I am sure that these minor kinks will be fixed soon. <br><br>Pros: <br><br>Colorful art style<br><br>Relaxing music<br><br>Dynamic levels<br><br>Fun gameplay<br><br>Controller support<br><br>Steam Achievements<br><br>Comic-like narrative<br><br>Kid friendly<br><br>Simple controls<br><br>Support for 18 languages (check Steam for list)<br><br>Cons:<br><br><br>Few bugs (minor and easy to get around)<br><br>Character does not change size with movement from background to foreground sometimes<br><br><br> <br>The developers provided a copy for the game to be reviewed, this did not affect the writer\u2019s opinion of the game. <br>          <br>You can also check out my team's website : <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.thegamerholics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.thegamerholics.com\/<\/a> .

Following a blackout event, an \u201calien creature\u201d traverses through electrical lines in an effort to bring light to those who need it most. Child-friendly gameplay, cute aesthetics and visual storytelling elements make this game a truly relaxing ride through Electro City. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><u><b>The Spark<\/b><\/u><br>Professor Brain needs help following an accident at the power station in Electro City, so he employs a cuddly alien creature (spark). The player controls this spark in an effort to bring electricity back into homes, activate failed generators, and maintain order throughout the shambling city.<br><br>There are lots of easy achievements that promote exploration of the many levels in TurnOn, including: an achievement for turning on 3 lamps for each level, an achievement for lighting up X in each level, etc. Animated comics, along with NPC actions throughout gameplay, provide immersive visual storytelling along with insight on upcoming levels.<br><br><u><b>Platforming Elements<\/b><\/u><br>In this platformer without platforms, the player traverses through electrical lines in order to progress. Many familiar platforming elements are utilized, such as: jumping\/falling, hazardous objects, hidden pathways\/alternate routes, collectibles (lightning), checkpoints, and a lethal fall (the ground). Even though TurnOn is a 2D platformer, its artistic use of multiple platforming depths\/layers and multi-linear progression makes it feel almost like a 2.5D platformer. <br><br>Most of the deaths in TurnOn stem from missing a line\/jump and falling to the ground. Every now and then, hazardous objects or an enemy (drone) will attribute to it, but this is a very friendly\/casual game so that\u2019s generally not the case. You can die from falling as many times as you need, without any penalty, and restart from a checkpoint. Any previously acquired lightning will remain in your possession. Specific objects, however, will hurt the spark\u2019s health (denoted by 3 green lightning bolts); these are red lightning bolts (collectibles) or enemies. If the spark loses all of its health, the level will restart, and all collectibles will be returned. Green lightning bolts can be collected to recover lost health.<br><br>One of TurnOn\u2019s most challenging, yet most exhilarating, elements is with its use of runner levels. On these levels, the screen and spark will progress forwards at an uncontrolled pace. Often times these runner levels are themed and present many active animations. A major aspect that makes me love these levels is with its great harmonization with the music. You will find yourself jumping and falling to the melody and beat changes (adds a lot of joy and promotes immersion).<br><br>Even though I personally enjoy the runner levels, the other platforming levels also provide a great deal of fun with its visual cues. Each level is themed, and often times, the spark will have a specific goal: guide the little girl back home by lighting up the street, scare away burglars by repowering alarms, revive a household\u2019s energy consumption, etc. This variation in level design and immersion through effortless storytelling helps keep the player compelled to continue playing.<br><br><u><b>Video Gameplay<\/b><\/u><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/U0Kik73QmM8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/U0Kik73QmM8<\/a><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Controls<\/div><u><b>Controller Support<\/b><\/u><br>The controls for TurnOn is very simplistic; 1D movement, jump, and fall. Although the controls, by default, are sufficient for gameplay when using a controller or M&amp;K, there is no support for rebinding controller\/keyboard buttons. This shouldn\u2019t be too big of an issue as precision handling is not required, but many platformer veterans may want to be aware of this.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div><u><b>Current State of the Game<\/b><\/u><br>The developers of the game seem to be very active with regards to player support and update frequency, as seen in the Discussions board and News updates. After only 5 days of release, a major patch was implemented to take Let\u2019s Plays and Review feedback into consideration.

side-scrolling gameplay.<\/div> Taking visual maze-work to a new level, Brainy Studio has created a unique platforming action comic book that will keep you entertained as you struggle to solve these perplexing levels. <br><br>A high sense of player agency is accomplished through this game, in the way that the gamer is able to see solutions having an effect on the world created in the comic book narrative. Each problem solved gives a sense of satisfaction that translates into the visual story you are playing out. <br><br><b>Comic Book Narrative:<\/b><br>The graphics are incredibly well done, in a heavy battle for supremacy with the audio soundtrack. You begin each level with a set of comic strips that basically gives you an indication of what you are expected to \u2018fix\u2019 in that level. So, the game is heavy on story while using no language. I know, right. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it could be done. But, there it is. This story is not dropped at any point, but plays out very dramatically in the conclusion. <br><br>The art is old-school Americana, with poignant scenes described by level titles like, Beware of Dog, School Routine, Unusual Date, Mad Tram, The Smell of Trouble, Mass Rally, and Pursuit in the Sky. The helicopter battle level &amp; the chopper high-wire level were two of my favorites. But, the Ferris Wheel was definitely spectacular as well. The level early on with the Drones was definitely a difficult level\u2026 probably the most difficult, since I was unsure of the requirements at first. So, the level difficulty doesn\u2019t really increase or decrease, since each level is built on a different and unique concept. This provides a lot of variety, as well as visual appeal.<br><br>The art is, as I mentioned, a comic book style, but the level maps are built in a medium that looks like modeling clay, and is very pleasing to the eye. Lots of primary colors are used throughout, so the overall effect is definitely enjoyable and artistic. It makes it difficult to believe so much can be accomplished with a four man team. This high level art translates into some very nice profile backgrounds if you collect the cards. <br><br><b>Audio, Audio, Audio!<\/b> <br>With a wide variety of music from old ragtime syncopated rhythms, to peaceful piano melodies; TurnOn is ear-candy. The only thing missing is some serious dlc for the soundtrack. I know I enjoy listening to game soundtracks, like some of the really great ones from Paradox games, while I\u2019m doing other things. If TurnOn gets a soundtrack, I will definitely be adding that to my playlist on my Smartphone. <br><br>The game fx is creative &amp; diverse. The voice sounds of the npc\u2019s can be annoying with repetition. But, I enjoyed the sound effects that came with the actions, as most of them were audible cues to success. <br><br>I received a copy of the game free for review purposes, but that in no way affects my review since I only play games I would enjoy. I do think it would be worth the price, even if you don\u2019t catch it on sale since the hours in-game are definitely worth the price. And, I will gladly buy any dlc that is later offered. <br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>TurnOn is one of <i>those<\/i> games that forces you out of the box of language by using just picture cue cards and visual, color, &amp; light cues to guide you through the levels. Even when speech is used with the npc\u2019s, it\u2019s just mumble-jumble, intended only to convey the urgency of a cry for help from people who are suffering some mishap because the power is out. That does serve to direct you, since the levels are not laid out linearly. The gameplay itself is linear, as you must complete one level to proceed to the next. But, within a level, the end action may be anywhere. Also, many actions don\u2019t open up until you\u2019ve performed other actions. So, you will find yourself zipping back &amp; forth, &amp; around &amp; about a level to complete all the tasks. <br><br>The game can be broken into halves at about the point of the Ferris Wheel. In the 1st half, you are still learning new \u2018tricks\u2019 to battle your way through the game. But, in the 2nd half you find the intensity picks up into some really awesome speed platforming. In the very beginning levels I missed some things, simply because I didn\u2019t understand the visual cue system. So, I\u2019d say this is not a game you will only play through once. <br><br>A number of the achievies are miss-able. I earned 80% on my first play-through, (which took me 12 hours) &amp; will definitely be replaying some levels to find the others. Part of the reason for this is the fact that parts of each level are hidden, &amp; activating the end-level action is not always obvious until you\u2019ve done it. Then, you missed some things. Of course, you can choose to replay the level immediately if you want, but I think most of us want to get to the end first, regardless of what we missed. <br><br>What I originally perceived as bugs turned out to be mistaken assumptions in the scoring system. Without saying more to prevent spoiling it for you, it\u2019s definitely a unique system that encourages trial &amp; error, as well as total mastery. The map is divided into areas, with levels within each area. It looks like there are 28 levels in all. Each area has about 3 levels that are the norm puzzle-type levels where you explore &amp; trigger generators, looking for the end action. Then, each area ends with a high-wire speed level, where you basically play in side-scroller fashion by jumping across gaps in the power lines, trying to stay on the wires until you reach the end.  <br><br>You are scored in each level at the end by how many lamps light up on the scoreboard. There is no indication of what scores are needed to get \u20183 lamps.\u2019 This needs to be added, along with level numbers on each scoreboard for those like me who want to look back at screenshots &amp; compare results. <br><br><b>UPDATE: Actually, I realized after posting my review that you can see you many points are needed to score 3 lamps by looking at your achievements page. You can see, for example, that you have achievied 134 of 136 on a specific level, meaning you were short by 2. So, basically, the requirements vary by level.<\/b><br><br><b>Controller or Keyboard?<\/b> <br>The controls are simple WASD &amp; usually only 2 keys at a time are used. I preferred using the keyboard controls for accuracy &amp; versatility for most puzzle levels. However, I found that using my Steam controller on the high-wire levels provided more speed. So, it looks like the type of game that if you really get into it like I did, then you will find yourself swapping back &amp; forth on the controls.<br><br>The game is similar to Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack. If you enjoyed that, where you don\u2019t see the whole level at once, but search high &amp; low for bonus items, then this game is for you. However, TurnOn is not as difficult, &amp; much more engaging to me, probably because of the art style &amp; music, as well as the simpler gameplay.<br><br><b>Pro\u2019s:<\/b><br>* Unique levels designed &amp; crafted individually<br>* Variety in game play<br>* Awesome music for each level!<br>* Eye-pleasing art with an engaging story<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>* No indication of how many points needed to score three lamps in a level <br>* Individuality of levels tends to leave difficulty a bit unbalanced from start to finish <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">You are sure to love the music &amp; art in this entertaining extravaganza of creativity. I highly recommend TurnOn for hours of platforming puzzle fun for everyone!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

city. A pretty cartoony artstyle, some simple controls, and a creative way of traversal Turn On it\u2019s an Indie game with great ideas, and Brainy Studios ,who  at the time of this review, is a team of 4 people, really put the effort into it, and manage to keep me engaged in this cool little platformer. The overall theme could be better explored, and there\u2019s not real challenge for \u201cHardcore Gamers!\u201d, but it\u2019s a game you should give a chance and try it out. Brainy Studio, you got me Turned On! (haha) for any future projects, and I\u2019m expecting to see more from you guys.<br><br>Score from F to A<br><br>Gameplay A<br>Story C<br>Presentation B<br><br>Final Score it's a  B<br><br><br>Watch the full review on this video.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WKLeezriCAY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WKLeezriCAY<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23363733', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23363733' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23363733\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23363733' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23363733\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23363733', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23363733_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23363733_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30162309\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051824204\/recommended\/428220\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"91558476\">snuffy_aus<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFound this game mostly relaxing platformer, not overly difficult and save\/checkpoints are reasonably spaced.

However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.<br><br>TurnOn is a colourful little side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you play as some sort of alien ball of electricity. Your job is to return light to a city that has plunged into darkness by repairing wires, turning on switches and completing circuits that restore electricity to the town. You work along side a scientist who sort of moves along each level with you. Together you overcome obstacles and puzzles in order to save the city from it's blackout. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Graphics: 7 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The graphic assets of the game are quite lovely. Each stage is presented differently with some great animation and lighting effects. It's a very colourful game despite the basis of the game being about lighting up a darkened area. The art-style is very cartoon-y but works well with the theme of the game. The game runs fine on any low to mid-tier setup.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Sound: 7 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The soundtrack of the game is also very well done. The game's music sets a nice tone for each of it's stages while at the same time following the game's motif. The other sound assets of the game are pretty standard, though they do get the job done. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Mechanics: 6 \/ 10 <\/b><br><br>The game has very solid mechanics, and plays how a puzzle platformer is expected too. You move your character around with the WASD keys and can jump using the space bar. Your goal is to traverse through the wires, hitting switches to turn the power back on, and return electricity to certain areas.<br><br>There will be puzzles in your way such as; which power boxes to activate and in which order, which wires to jump and travel on or which direction to move in. It is not very difficult, although the obstacles do become progressively more challenging as you continue to play. <br><br>You more or less only die in the game if you make a blind jump off screen into the wrong area, which can be a problem as there are certain points within the game where you do need to make blind jumps. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Final Personal Remarks: <\/b> <br><br>The game is really cute and colourful. It's something I can see people playing when they want to take a break from playing more intense games. It's not incredibly difficult either. It's more of a highly stylized maze. You can see where you need to go during each stage, and if you get stuck, a bit of trial and error will usually overcome the challenge. I do think the game is enjoyable, and there might be some more value to the game for those who enjoy speed running. <br><br>Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.<br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29496352', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29496352' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29496352\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29496352' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29496352\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29496352', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29496352_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29496352_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29485102\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrspoon\/recommended\/428220\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"11190735\">Applekid<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAt $15 I DO NOT reccomend this game.

Here's why. <br><br>I though it was going to be a relaxing and casual exploration\\puzzle platformer...which it is. <i>Mostly<\/i>. <br><br>Several levels had been designed to add some kind of 'challange', but they only add frustration instead. 'Boss fight'  with the copter had been the worst so far, but those few 'runner' levels I've seen also leave much to be desired. I suppose they were meant to mimic a rhythm-based gameplay, where following the music is a right way to jump through all the gaps, traps and such...but the thing is - jump\\air control is not too strong in this one. It's mediocre (to say the least), which is not a death-crime for a nicely drawn casual family-friendly platformer, really...if not for those 'annoying.... oh, I mean 'challenging' levels.<br><br>Do I recommend the game? May be. Especially with a good discount. Just have in mind, that it's not that 'casual' and 'relaxing' as it seems to be.  Nice art, good music, interesting 'character' (if that's the word for a glowing electric bubble). but those levels?
