Not because I don't enjoy the soundtrack, but because I forget about it, or i've written a review for the game. I decided I needed to go back and write a review for this one, and I'll try to make it the best I can since it's the first one in English. If you're here because you want the game, and you're not sure if you should go ahead and get the soundtrack edition: GET IT. This is the best soundtrack for a game I've listened to so far, both for its beauty, and its creativity. <br><br>When I first played through the game, I immediately noticed that the soundtrack was amazing. It fits perfectly, being calm and godly, or adventurous and inspirational when it needs to be. It's great both as background music, or something to listen and pay attention to. Once the cutscenes ended and it was time to focus and figure out how the game worked, I payed more attention to that. When my friend I was playing with said &quot;I wonder what language this is in&quot; I shrugged it off, knowing I could figure out later when I ended up buying the soundtrack (because I made the mistake of buying the base game).<br><br>Today, about a week after I bought the soundtrack, I finally listened to it and tried to figure out what language the songs were in. Aftera couple minutes, I was still completely puzzled as to what language it was, but after giving it another minute, I got it. It's not a language different from English. It's English... backwards. The instruments are recorded normally, but the singer is backwards. This is so creative for two reasons: 1, I would have never expected the &quot;foreign language&quot; to be my own language backwards, and 2, this works very well with the game because it gives it an eery god-like feeling, like it's something not meant to be understood, yet can be understood as something beautiful.<br><br>If you're interested, there's videos of the song &quot;Guilty Moon&quot; on youtube, both forwards (like it is in the game) and backwards (reversed, so the instruments are backwards but the singer is understood). <br><br>10\/10 - A breathtaking, relaxing, and creative soundtrack.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29018758', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29018758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29018758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29018758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29018758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29018758', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29018758_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29018758_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29660861\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198194206589\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"233940861\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9f0647420c3cce48cc3f25d29c06adf63bb99e12.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9f0647420c3cce48cc3f25d29c06adf63bb99e12.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9f0647420c3cce48cc3f25d29c06adf63bb99e12_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198194206589\/\" data-miniprofile=\"233940861\">Robb E.

Each song has a unique feel to it, ranging from the boss fight rush to painful regret, but all of them feel like they're from an ethereal being, something god-like (which is, of course, fitting.) The songs with vocals were especially otherworldly, with the singer singing in a strange language that I didn't know, until I really listened and looked it up. It's English, backwards, with forwards instrumentals. I was surprised, but I don't expect less from people who were able to make this great soundtrack.<br><br>Honestly, if you have the money for it, just get this soundtrack or the soundtrack edition from this game. You won't reget it. This soundtrack has more emotion and story alone than most full-length games that cost three times as much and are half as entertaining. <br><br>I give it what it deserves - 10\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29660861', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29660861' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29660861\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29660861' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29660861\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29660861', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29660861_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29660861_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29018758","29660861"]}
