You interact with various objects with simplified controls that do not get in the way of the action. This creates a casual game experience that allows you to just run around the ship and search for clues, without trying to keep up with key-mapping. Clues, maps, and data are all kept at hand for you to retrieve on demand. <br><br><b>Game Mechanics: <\/b><br>There is a large stealth element. The sound effects become part of the detective work, as you find yourself listening for footsteps to grow louder and then quieter again to monitor the passing of guards. You are able to lean left or right to peer around doorways, with the camera angle accommodating your changed angles.<br><br><b>Dialogue Choices: <\/b><br>I was surprised to see that not only did my choices matter, but even becoming suspicious by being caught snooping around caused me to be able to gain more info from shady characters like myself. The story line seems malleable to the character you create. <br><br><b>Narrative: <\/b><br>The story is filled with references to Steampunk genre subjects; like technology, religion, and progressive utopian dreams of a \u201cScientific\u201d society.  The player chooses from a variety of responses to each of these topics in conversation, ranging from agreeable, to snarky (Think Deponia.) The player character also is allowed to choose buffs at various points in the narrative to choose a focus on conversation, mechanical repair, stealth\/breaking &amp; entering, for example. In this sense the game reminds me of Deus Ex, though on a simpler level. You are also able to choose how to respond to being discovered. You are able to bribe the npc\u2019s to look the other way, or you may choose to be a bully. <br><br><b>Graphics: <\/b><br>The graphics are not as simple as point &amp; click hidden object mysteries, or The Shivah.  Yet, it is not as complex as The Portal. It fits nicely in the same complexity of graphics as Stanley\u2019s Parable.  Once I warmed up to the style of game, I soon became caught up in the story; probably because the ease of play facilitated simply doing the missions I was given. It makes solving the mystery enjoyable, rather than stressful, providing a lightly humorous spin on politics and revolt, with cartoon-style artwork. <br><br><b>Pros: <\/b><br>Minimal &amp; easy to learn<br>Humorous<br>Who-done-it Mystery <br><br><br><b>Cons: <\/b><br>Simplistic Graphics <br>Low complexity game play <br><br><br><b> I recommend it for casual and family gamers.<\/b> Overall, the replay-ability is average, with achievements for playing through the different branches of choices. The game is suitable for most age groups, and simple enough for even the casual gamer. But, it is not a game for hard-core gamers who like complex games. The achievements are simple enough to be mastered by most gamers. Many gamers could complete a play-through in less than 3 hours. (Longer required for mastery.)  It has cards and artwork.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21663298', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21663298' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21663298\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21663298' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21663298\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21663298', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21663298_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21663298_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21775729\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"109369258\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c78a523ba571fe6a2034c344945ed4b38eee1074.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c78a523ba571fe6a2034c344945ed4b38eee1074.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c78a523ba571fe6a2034c344945ed4b38eee1074_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/\" data-miniprofile=\"109369258\">BirdCute<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/games\/?tab=all\">1,999 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/recommended\/\">66 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BirdCute\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Karaski: What Goes Up ...<\/b> is a good-looking indie adventure game that is happening on an airship.<br>If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">What is happening in the game:<\/div>You are on an airship, but it has been sabotaged. You have to talk to passengers and uncover the truth about the mystery. The problem is that your suspicion is raising as well, so you could be the one accused of sabotage.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li><b>Sounds<\/b> | The soundtrack is really good, it fits the whole vintage airship theme. The sound effect (walking, interacting and environment sounds) are also very nice.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Graphics<\/b> | If you look at the Store page screenshots, you'll see that this game has a unique style. It looks really nice. I like their choice of fonts used for dialogues and animations. I won't say any more words, though, because I have no clue how I would describe how this game looks. All I know is that it looks nice.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Story<\/b> | Every adventure game needs a good story, and this game certainly doesn't fail at this. There are multiple choices you can make, from bonuses that help you, to dialogues that influence how much people on the airship like you. Based on what impression you give and what choices you make in the game, you can also get different endings. There are not a lot of adventure games that offer variety like this, so I'm considering this as a very huge plus.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Atmosphere<\/b> | This game invokes that mysterious atmosphere that I simply love. It's like a horror game without the horror element, it just leaves this tense and wonderful feeling when you're playing. This is mostly because of nice graphics and the soundtrack combined. Airship turbulences that shake your screen every once in a while also help a lot.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Achievements<\/b> | There are a lot of achievements. However, most of them don't unlock when you progress in the story you're playing, but are unlocked when you obtain certain items or do certain actions. This leaves a lot of space for replaying the game over and over again. Some achievements haven't even been unlocked by anyone yet!<br>    <\/li><li><b>Clues, Quests and Suspects<\/b> | You have a special menu where you will find your current quests. This is really good, especially for people who tend to forget what quests were all about. There is also a menu where all clues are stored and another one where you can find everything about potential suspect on board. The more you learn about them, the more filled out the menu is.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Updates<\/b> | The developer obviously cares about the game, as there are regular updates that fix a lot of bugs, add new features or improve some things. I had my problems myself that were fixed in the latest update, which certainly improved my opinion of the game. The developer is also very active on Steam Discussions, helping out players that have experienced bugs.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Pricing<\/b> | For 12 $\/\u20ac, I think this game is certainly worth its price. I've seen some worse adventure games for higher prices, so this one is definitely a good deal. More about this in the final section of my review.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li><b>Linux\/MacOS Support<\/b> | Sadly, you can only play this game on Windows operating system. Support for other systems shouldn't be too hard to add, since this game is made in Unity and that makes multi-OS builds very simple to make.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Stealth<\/b> | This is the most annoying problem for me. Sometimes I just feel like there are way too many guards around and they notice you pretty quickly. When they do, you have to bribe them, which uses up your entire wallet pretty fast. The game would be just fine with less guards, in my opinion.<br>    <\/li><li><b>Resolution Problems<\/b> | When playing the game in certain resolutions, some parts of in-game menus may &quot;fall&quot; off the screen. This can only be fixed by selecting a different resolution, often even playing in windowed mode. I heard that this is getting fixed, though.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The final verdict:<\/div>The game is pretty good. With its awesome graphics, nice soundtrack, a great story and other things it should give you the perfect adventure game experience. I especially liked the mysterious atmosphere, which just makes you play more and more. There are 50 achievements, which also add a lot to the replayability value. This is of course one of the things I use to decide whether the game is worth its price or not. Karaski is definitely worth it! It even has multiple endings and your actions really affect the gameplay flow a lot. This is a textbook example of &quot;your choices matter&quot; games.<br>In short, if you like adventure and point'n'click games, definitely consider getting this game. It's one of the best adventure games I've played in quite some times and it's constantly getting improved.<br><br>Greetings,<br>BirdCute<br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Note that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Each represented a core belief system; faith in technology, business, religion, and nationalism albeit to different degrees and even sometimes with a bitterness at the core.I applaud the creator's efforts at making a believable background and that each of the main characters is largely more than the sum of their parts.<br><br>The gameplay and aesthetics remind me of The Ship:In both games stealth plays a large role although with Karaski you are utilizing it much differently and are not meant to kill or be killed. Bribery,lockpicks, and even slippers which somehow smother your footsteps enough to render you completely silent are your tools to solve the mystery of who sabotaged the A.A. Karaski.At first it seems exciting to have to listen to the footsteps of stewards and guards in order to avoid detection, but there are many ways to mitigate any effects of being caught and eventually I got lazy and stopped caring.<br><br>The writing shows elements of wit and humor, but it never really feels tense or dramatic and at times those &quot;big ideas&quot; feel shoehorned in to the plot. <br><br>The game boasts of replayability and perhaps there is truth to that but I doubt I will be playing it again any time soon. It must be said that the current asking price is too high for what the game gives you, in the end.<br><br>6.5\/10, recommended to fans of casual point-n-click adventure titles.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21756442', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21756442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21756442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21756442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21756442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21756442', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21756442_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21756442_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21589707\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/evilhackman\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"33535381\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/064c8d5680eb8cfd1270aec4d8bf2409559e0318.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/064c8d5680eb8cfd1270aec4d8bf2409559e0318.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/064c8d5680eb8cfd1270aec4d8bf2409559e0318_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/evilhackman\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33535381\">[ROTT] hackman<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/evilhackman\/games\/?tab=all\">1,437 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/evilhackman\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/evilhackman\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKaraski is a unique first-person adventure game with lots of exploration, investigation and stealth mechanics.<br>The game takes place roughly in the 1920s onboard the airship AA Karaski, the sole pride of the Commonwealth of Dunabe and the first of its kind.<br>Your name? Chose yourself. Your past? Unknown. When you wake up from what seems to be the result of someone hitting you over the head, you'll soon learn that the airship has been sabotaged by terrorists. The fact that you were near the crime scene instantly turns you into one of the suspects, so it's only in your best interest to find the real saboteurs.<br>A mysterios voice over radio gives you instructions, but who are they, and can you trust them? It doesn't matter, as you get thrown head over feet into a thick complot of either selfish, nationalist or economic interests. Everyone onboard of the airship seems to have is own motives for turning this first ever airship flight into a disaster.<br>Over the course of the game your main activities consist of talking to the various crew and passengers, scavenging for evidence, breaking into rooms, bribing or sneaking around guards to get into prohibited areas. If you aren't careful, your suspicion level will rise and your dialogue partners will be a lot less cooperative. Stealth is a big part of Karaski, so thankfully the game provides you with various tools like lockpicks, vent openers and more to make your life easier.<br>Pros:<br>- interesting characters with their own stories and motives for sabotage<br>- pretty &amp; atmospheric art style and music<br>- various endings<br>- nonlinear, mission based gameplay<br>- very intuitive UI with tabs for suspects, clues, inventory and missions<br><br>Cons:<br>- sneaking can get dreadful at times, esp. if you have to find that <i>one<\/i> item in the middle of a prohibited area<br>- no spoken dialogue<br>- lots of running back and forth<br>- relatively few usable items<br>- very open ending<br><br>Will you find the true saboteur(s)? Will you even be able to save the airship? It's all up to you!<br>Recommended to true adventure game fans!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21589707', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21589707' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21589707\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21589707' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21589707\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21589707', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21589707_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21589707_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21588021\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"74032147\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32bc260c6437e835756fc6d61c87b1c645c23c0b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32bc260c6437e835756fc6d61c87b1c645c23c0b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32bc260c6437e835756fc6d61c87b1c645c23c0b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74032147\">Kurt Russell<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/games\/?tab=all\">4,514 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/recommended\/\">58 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Duke899\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe last few years have seen a resurgence of adventure games. A genre once thought dead, or at least dormant got an injection of adrenaline from two sources: Double Fine (helmed by veteran adventure game designer Tim Schafer) and relatively newcomers Telltale. But giving those two fine companies ALL the credit for the resurgence of adventure games wouldn't be fair. Others have also done an amazing job keeping people interested in the genre. People such as the fine guys over at Cardboard Computer or Unbound Creations. Today we'll be talking about a game released by the latter (who also released the most excellent Postmortem: One must die)<br><br>Karaski: What Goes Up... is that game. The interesting thing about Unbound Creations is that their games don't focus all that much on puzzles, QTEs or life altering decisions. They instead chose to focus on people and small, personal stories. Karaski is a game about a magnificent airship which has experienced a catastrophic accident. But that's not really it... It's a game about the people in that airship, their motivations, their small quirks and what they did before they got onboard. <br>As an agent for an unknown organization you must discover what happened to the airship and who's the saboteur (or is it you?!) In order to accomplish your objective you can sneak, talk, intimidate or steal stuff. But there's nobody there to tell you exactly what happened, and nothing is set in stone. Your actions will dictate the ending, and you will decide what happened by yourself, after hearing what the characters have to say, or obtaining the information by other means. It's a game designed to be replayed, and in many ways it works similarly to a choose your own adventure book (or a Way of the Samurai game)<br><br>Will you discover what happened to the magnificent airship Karaski? Will you save the ship from certain doom? Or maybe you were the saboteur all along?<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21588021', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21588021' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21588021\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21588021' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21588021\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21588021', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21588021_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21588021_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22110887\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bowieologist\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71034422\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/79\/7913892ba3a2125f036e90f8027badbc6d5c12b0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/79\/7913892ba3a2125f036e90f8027badbc6d5c12b0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/79\/7913892ba3a2125f036e90f8027badbc6d5c12b0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bowieologist\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71034422\">Panopticon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bowieologist\/games\/?tab=all\">1,280 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bowieologist\/recommended\/\">25 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bowieologist\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&quot;XIII&quot; and &quot;The Ship&quot; had a baby, they named it &quot;Karaski: What Goes Up&quot;<br><br>Edit: Finished my 2nd playthrough right now and realized I had missed some options that I would find really enjoyable in my first plathrough such as:<br><br>+ [Toggle no headbobbing]<br>+ [Toggle no stylized fonts in conversations]<br>+ [Toggle no screenshake]<br><br>Glad I noticed these! I usually go through the options but somehow missed this. For me it makes it an even greater experience. <br><br>I was surprisingly drawn more and more into this the more I played.

A 3rd run will most likely be coming up soon to be honest.<br><br>If you like mystery games with great dialogues and choices, different endings and outcomes with albeit subpar and at times annoying stealth elements but the second playthrough made them much easier (and the gameplay can be a bit &quot;too simple&quot; perhaps) but with a lot of important reading, investigating clues and items, engaging in conversations carefully and &quot;create your own path&quot; style gameplay then do check it out! <br><br>To top it off the soundtrack is enjoyable as well, not many tracks I believe but with an ambient\/downtempo genre, the main(?) exploration theme is dream-like almost so ethereal that it's out of place but it does actually fit into the mystery mood of the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22110887', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22110887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22110887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22110887' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22110887\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22110887', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22110887_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22110887_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21735345\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">Warwick J.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/games\/?tab=all\">4,672 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/\">269 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you remember the game Postmortem: One Must Die? It\u2019s an indie adventure game that was awarded strong praise in some corners of the gaming press back in 2013. It was praised because it had well written and nuanced characters. Unfortunately not everybody on Steam appreciated that game and thus it has only received mix review scores. However, the development studio that made that game is Unbound Creations and they are back with Karaski: What Goes Up. It certainly appears that they\u2019ve listened to the constructive feedback, both good and bad, from Postmortem and have put the lessons that they have learned into execution here. This is an adventure game with plenty of action and of course the characters are again written superbly.<br><br>At the very beginning of the game you are told something that is clearly ominous. You will be asked many questions. However, the correct answers are the decision that you make. The truth is woven by your decisions. Each of your actions has an impact and consequences follow. I\u2019ve always enjoyed games that do this if they are able pull it off without making the player feel that regardless of the decisions that they made the story and its outcome would have remained the same. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to make it work. To this end I believe that Unbound Creations really did well with this in the game.<br><br>The game is set upon an airship \u2013 the first ever airship in fact \u2013 and somebody has sabotaged it. You are potentially a prime suspect due to your proximity to it when you awoke from the concussion. The good thing is that it is entirely up to you to determine who did it, why they did it and how they did it. The great thing, in regards to replayability, is that there is more than one solution to the game and by that I mean that unless you play the same way \u2013 choosing the same options \u2013 you\u2019re never going to play the same game twice.<br><br>The  graphics and the sound featured within Karaski are certainly apt and aide immersion. They\u2019re not state of the art by any means but they have been carefully chosen. They follow the principle of \u2018KISS\u2019 \u2013 keep it simple stupid \u2013 so as to not take away from the game play, the story or the mystery of the game which are the clear and decided focuses of the game. The graphics are almost cartoonlike in stature and you\u2019ll be able to notice this from the very beginning as you walk through the exhibition on the way to getting onto the airship.<br><br>If adventure and action wasn\u2019t enough the game also introduces a well thought out stealth mechanic. When a steward, the doctor or other members of the ship can see you you need to be careful. If you get caught going into places where you should not be your level of suspicion will rise. This has a lot of impact on the way people will see you on board the ship. You may even find yourself being found guilty of a crime that you didn\u2019t commit. It really is a great touch.<br><br>A feature on Karaski would be remiss if I failed to mention the humor. It\u2019s present all throughout the game and helps provide the game a certain charm that really aides the player in wanting to continue playing the game through to the conclusion. For such a serious matter the lighthearted presentation really works. This is an enormous strength and demonstrates the depth of the writing to see beyond the base layers. There is humor and delight to be found in even the smallest of matters.<br><br>A rock solid adventure game with stealth play, a lot of well written humor, deep characters and a great narrative. Karaski: What Goes Up ticks all of the boxes.<br><br>For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/<\/a><br>Please feel free to join our wonderful community on <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Steamified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Steam<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21735345', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21735345' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21735345\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21735345' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21735345\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21735345', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21735345_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21735345_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22141015\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"42764647\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c8f3c162fb3afecc766b224c4e481336b89648db_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42764647\">The_Cpt_FROGGY<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/games\/?tab=all\">2,072 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/recommended\/\">248 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198003030375\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKARASKI: What Goes Up . . .  <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>  <br>The \u201cAA KARASKI\u201d airship is the pride of the Commonwealth of Danube and the first of its kind. You will take part in its maiden voyage set for the 11th of October 1923, which is an entire five days floating in the sky. What a sensational way to go from one part of the Commonwealth of Danube to another. However, on the third day of this exceptional trip, you will wake up in an unfamiliar room with a rather strong headache (well, someone knocked you on your noggin pretty hard \u2013that\u2019ll do it!). You will find out very quickly that something is wrong with the airship. Someone tampered with the \u201cAA KARASKI\u201d and you need to figure out who is\/are the culprit (s). Oh, by the way, how is your noggin?<br><br>Karaski: What Goes Up is an adventure \/ stealth game which takes place on the airship \u201cAA KARASKI.\u201d You will have to investigate and find out who is behind the sabotage. The story is very well written with great dialogues. As you interrogate people, you will be able to choose several options available to you. Depending on your response, it can affect your relationship which each person. At the start of the game, you will not have anything on you and you will not be able to open certain doors until you manage to get the \u201c lockateer\u201d  tool. Other tools and keys need to be found in order to open ventilation shafts, wooden boxes and doors to restricted areas. Make sure you look everywhere and collect all the money and bottles of alcohol you can find laying around. Read as many newspapers and notes as you can; they will give you additional information on what is going on in the Commonwealth of Danube and give you some evidence too. <br><br>As you progress, you will receive quests to do. All of them are related to the suspects. Make sure you are not acting suspicious. Things like being caught by a steward when you are opening a locked door will arouse suspicion about you. Sometimes you can bribe them with money or a good bottle of grog. Oh, one more thing . . .  if you screen is shaking, it is not because of the alcohol, it\u2019s because the airship is passing through turbulence! <br><br>Plenty of achievements in this game but most of them are hidden, which is good in regards to re-playability.<br>The graphics are good and I had absolutely no problem with resolution.

A. Karaski. When I joined this miracle of technology, I was excited with curiosity, how it works and what I\u2019ll experience during the flight. I actually thought that I would spend the entire journey in a bar on the upper deck sipping fancy whiskey with casual conversation. After boarding, I picked up a boarding pass, introduced myself to a guide of the airship and headed to my cabin. Well, was just going to, because just around the corner I somehow fainted and my plan was screwed a little. A lot.<br><br>I woke up in a store room somewhere in the lower deck. I was glad I\u2019m alive, my head screamed with pain. When searching for a way out, I just remembered that the guide told me something about, that I will question a lot of people on various issues and it will depend a lot on what I\u2019ll know about them. I would rather know, how to get out and complain to the captain, what happened to me. I want an apology and a big glass of whiskey! Right in the next room it became even weirder. There was a turned on radio speaking to me. So, the thing is, there's someone on the ship, who does not want it to reach its destination. And I'm here to solve this question. OK, well, but who is it and what he wants to do? And there are apparently wardens to immediately lead me out or arrest when they spot me.<br><br>So I crawled around the first warden through a ventilation shaft and ran into the next room. I have discovered a wounded technician, broken ship control panel bursting with fire and acid bottle with a glove near it. Someone wanted to sabotage the ship! I went back to the radio and was told that it could easily be me. Such stupidity\u2026 I had to find out what is really going on and who is to blame! I ran up on deck and immediately met Jean, enthusiastic journalist. All passengers apparently felt the turbulence and thinks that something strange happened to the ship. She asked me to cooperate in the investigation. But could I trust her?<br><br>I had to explore the entire ship, avoiding guards, sometimes even bribing them not to report me, pick locks into the private rooms, search the crates with cargo, scuff my knees in the air ducts, but also talk to all the people on board\u2026 one of them had to be a saboteur. Sometimes it wasn't easy, I had to share a bottle of booze with them and to force them to talk. It seemed that it had to be one of the big four, Mrs. Boyel, that weird doctor, designer of the airship Karaski or even the captain? And then these lost parachutes... I felt at the end like Hercule Poirot, but I found the person who was responsible for this ... I think so at least. Or was I wrong?<br><br>Karaski: What Goes Up, is a smoothly playable mix of steampunk adventure with stealth action, where the main thing is well written story with deep characters. Nonlinear progress and stylized graphics help to desire to explore all parts of the game and also thanks to multiple endings and achievements it\u2019s fun to play it repeatedly. The only major drawback I see is the absence of voiceovers, which decreases immersion a little. Lift off!<br><br>This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

I enjoyed the developer's previous title <i>Postmortem<\/i>, but it had many problems and the gameplay wasn't all that entertaining. However, they fixed all of that with this game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">STORY<\/div>The story is inspired by classic whodunit novels by Agatha Christie. You play as a Sir\/Madame who partecipates to the first flight of the Glorious Commonwealth's airship. However, one day someone knocks you over your head and you wake up in the ship's lower deck, where someone sabotaged the engines and killed a guard. You find a two-way radio from which someone mistakes you for an Agent, and it orders you to discover who the culprit is.<br>As a fan of mystery novels, I loved every aspect of this game, from its mysterious setup, to talking with all the different people who are on the ship (passengers, bartenders, workers) and to the outstanding and satisfying ending where you will choose, based on the clues you found, who is to blame for damaging the ship. There are also political subplots, conspiracies, spies, and a lot of lore to further help you in your final decision.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">GRAPHICS<\/div>The game is developed with the Unity engine, and it looks pretty darn good. It uses cell-shaded characters and locations for a more cartoonish and light-hearted feel. The areas that you explore feature some great steam-punk architecture and furnitures, and I loved exploring every inch of the map, from the Crew Deck to the Private Lounge and Bar. The only real issue is the walking animation of some characters, which looks more like they are floating rather than walking.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">GAMEPLAY<\/div>Your goal is to find enough clues by exploring the different decks, talking with the other passengers and picking up objects. Some areas of the ship are off-limit, which means that you must stealth your way through them, avoiding getting caught by guards. If they ever manage to tackle you, you can either pay them or talk your way out of it, otherwise a Suspicion Meter will start rising, and less and less passengers will start believing what you say to them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CHALLENGE<\/div>The game is not all that hard, but even the slightest mistake (getting caught by the guards when trespassing, disagreeing with some you're talking to,...) will make you lose trust, and every character will start suspecting you of being the saboteur. However, if you are even slightly familiar with stealth games, you won't have that big of a trouble avoiding guards.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">SOUND<\/div>The soundtrack is really good: I really enjoyed listening to the music that was coming out of the radios, and, while it is royalty-free music, it further immersed me into this living and breathing world. There are however a couple of sound effects, especially when going to the ship's maintenance rooms, that are extremely loud and annoying.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">REPLAYABILITY<\/div>Every time you play the game, there are different choices to make that will change the way other characters react to you, as well as a different culprit based on the clues you find hidden in the environments. There are also newspapers and letters that fully explore the game's universe, and many Steam achievements to unlock.<br><br><br>Overall, <b>Karaski<\/b> is one of the better detective games I have ever played thanks to its interesting dialogue and layered characters.

It's good, but not great.  <br><br>Game play is primarily a first person narrative.  You awake on an airship just after an explosion and you walk and talk to people to figure out the culprit.  Sort of.  The game's greatest strength is also its biggest weakness because while there is a pretty dynamic story with lots of options to pick from, you are not figuring out the story as much as you are writing it.  You can pick anyone you want to be the culprit, even be the culprit yourself, the game might be like &quot;these bits of evidence that you uncovered don't quite match, but hey whatever you want&quot; then there's a bit of outro that tells how your choices affected the world.  That's brilliant from a creative standpoint, but rather dull from a gamer standpoint.  I want my choices to affect the world I interact with, not the overall world that my character goes on to live in.  The game itself is pretty non-consequential.<br><br>There's also some stealth elements, but they are pretty basic.  There's only two areas where you actually have to dodge guards.  The rest are just walking clockwise, and flipping a coin to guess if someone might see you when you leave a restricted area.  There are also 4 main &quot;powerups&quot; you can unlock as you play.  You get to choose these powerups as you go, and they affect how you enter certain rooms, sometimes restricting access to them.  It makes the gameplay seem less-linear, but really it only makes your backtracking non-linear.  The main areas are still unlocked in the same order.<br><br>Graphics and sounds are decent.  The game switched art styles between the alpha and the release version, so while it looks interesting it's also jaring to look out the window and see crayon clouds floating by.  There's lots of public domain music that you've heard in other games, so take that for what you will.<br><br>There are also, currently (v1.09), a number of small bugs.  Nothing game breaking, but a lot of the achievements are not working properly and that is disapointing.<br><br>If I can summarize with a popular arbitrary rating system, I'd give the game 6\/10.  Just over the line of a game that might not be worth the price.  I do enjoy the developers ideas.  I intend to check out their other game, Post Mortem, to see how it aligns with this one, and hopefully their next title is just as promising.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25386167', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25386167' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25386167\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25386167' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25386167\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25386167', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25386167_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25386167_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25067494\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047085001\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"86819273\">SolomonPierce<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 18.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was a fantastic mystery game.  I really loved the setting, and the suspect characters were very well done, each with their own potential motives.  Chances are you may not be able to decide on the culprit your first time through, and this makes you want to go back and look for more and more clues.  I was surprised by the amount of detail put into this game, and I'd love to play another just like this.  It might not be for everyone, but it's right up my alley.

Still, what Karaski lacks in gameplay, it compensates in exploration, narrative, its characters and the player\u2019s dialogue with them. <b><u>If you\u2019re a fan of adventure and\/or mystery games and like to play detective, I think the chances of you enjoying Karaski are very high.<\/u><\/b><br><br>The game takes places aboard the Karaski, the first Commonwealth airship, as it makes its first flight. Despite being somewhat quiet at first, things quickly take a quick turn and someone ends up sabotaging the ship. It is up to you to investigate and determine who is responsible for the attack on this Commonwealth technological marvel. There are certainly a lot of plot holes left by the main story but these are filled by your dialogue choices, not only in terms of the world the game takes place but in terms of the history background of your character and others as well. <b>What this means is that there are really no wrong answers, you make your own truth.<\/b><br><br>In this sense, sometimes it felt like I was actually playing at another time, in another place, in the same universe as <i>Papers, Please<\/i> but in a context that reminded of <i>The Ship<\/i> . Despite the fact that both have very distinct art styles and ways of telling a story, some aspects of Karaski did remind me of the whole nationalist propaganda that was present in <i>Papers, Please<\/i>. Still, I must say that the game did fail to keep me fully immersed at times, either due to the clunky animations or due to the fact that I\u2019m still not 100% sure if I like or dislike the visuals of the game. Eitherways, I must say that the music you hear coming from certain radios on the ship add a lot to the atmosphere and helps make the world a lot more believable.<br><br>Your investigation will be focused around 4 major characters, with each one representing a certain \u201cgroup\u201d. One is more inclined towards religion, other is a nationalist, another is the architect of the Karaski airship itself and the last one is one of the members of the board of the biggest railroad company, to whom the introduction of transportation of goods and people by air poses a great threat. You\u2019ll spend a lot of your time sneaking around in places where you shouldn\u2019t be trying to figure out clues and the potential motives for any of these suspects to have sabotaged the airship. In this sense, the game features a branching storyline in which your choices have their own consequences and, in result, the game has different endings which are a result of your actions.<br><br>In the end, I feel like from the small list of <b><u>complaints<\/u><\/b> that I have about the game there is only one that might be a deal breaker for some people, and that is the fact that the game has no voice acting, which can be exceptionally disappointing in a game that focuses on dialogue and narrative. Apart from that, I just don\u2019t really stylized font of dialogues, which thankfully you can turn off and also the head bobbing. Like I\u2019ve initially said, the gameplay itself is nothing to be amazed by, you\u2019ll be leaning around corners to watch out for guards but once you get a hold of certain items the worry of getting caught where you\u2019re not supposed to be on the ship quickly goes away.<br><br><b><u>If you\u2019re craving a rather unique adventure game that emphasizes your choices, the characters and the world surrounding you instead of certain mechanics, or if you\u2019re craving for a believable world that lets your own mind fill in the gaps left by the developer I 100% think you should check this one out.<\/u><\/b><br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

While it is a genre that has never had huge mainstream appeal, when done right it creates quite a compelling space.<br><br>CONTROLS (3.5\/5)<br><br>Karaski is a social stealth game and plays a bit like a blend of a fairly basic stealth title and adventure game. Its stealth mechanics are not deep or refined, and mostly consist of making sure you\u2019re out of line of sight before you do anything risky. That being said, the options available are generally more than adequate, though not mechanically interesting enough to be a reason to seek out the game.<br><br>Adventure elements play like most other first-person adventures, running around talking to people, digging through their personal effects for doodads and currency, and occasionally using what you find to get more access to the plot.<br><br>GRAPHICS\/SOUND (2.5\/5)<br><br>As a low-budget affair by a small development team it should surprise no one that the visual side of things isn\u2019t very impressive. Karaski is visually Spartan, favoring big and exaggerated geometry in the level designs over small details.<br><br>Characters designs are similar, with ornaments like hats and beards distinguishing characters more than unique faces. I\u2019d found there could also be some strange judder with the game when mousing over objects that could be interacted with.<br><br>There\u2019s no voice acting, which can be a little distracting, but it does allow for characters to have a wider range of dialogue. Music seems highly inspired by the type of tracks you\u2019d hear in old propaganda pieces and fits the game\u2019s tone rather well, even if it does little to stand out.<br><br>Sound effects are a bit hit or miss, with footsteps drowning things out a bit too much, though it does make for good positional cues when sneaking around.<br><br>GAMEPLAY (3.5\/5)<br><br>The airship Karaski is taking its inaugural flight as a demonstration of the might of the glorious Commonwealth, a fictional stand in for the U.S.S.R., and the player has managed to snag a ticket. As you are boarding, however, you are quickly bopped on the head.<br><br>From there on you can make the story your own as the game allows you to play it as just a temporary knockout, or perhaps it gave you amnesia. Soon a mysterious radio is asking for your help, offering another opportunity where you can also play along or craft your own backstory. The game is full of little moments like this that allow you to fill in the blanks of your past.<br><br>Regardless of whatever backstory you decide on, the main thrust of the plot has the player investigating the mysterious sabotaging of the ship. It seems someone doesn\u2019t want the flight to be a success, and there are four prime suspects: the architect Karaski, whom the ship (and thus the game) are named for, the rebellious ship captain, the religious doctor that sees mankind flying as a sin, and the train magnate that could view airship travel as competition.<br><br>At the start of the game you\u2019ll get to choose a tool you fancy, and these significantly affect the gameplay. A fake police badge will get you out of trouble and might coerce information out of people, while a lock-pick will get you into the many locked rooms you\u2019ll find in the course of the game.<br><br>Most of these items can also be found later in the game, but some are well hidden. During my first playthrough, for instance, I never found the item that lets you unlock and navigate vents, which closed off a few story beats.<br><br>Players are given relatively free rein to explore the ship, provided you can uncover the tools needed to get there, though there are a few choke points in the story. Many things you do impact the fates of the various characters, so even if you\u2019re given a side-quest that you think is helping, the effect of completing it may end up doing more harm than good.<br><br>Karaski\u2019s stealth mechanics are probably the least interesting element of the game, with the story and the ways you can change it being the strong point. Wisely there is no combat or death if you get caught; instead you\u2019re ejected from where you were trespassing.<br><br>You may be able to bribe your way out of trouble, though if you don\u2019t, your suspicion meter will rise. That can affect the way characters view you. Some actually seem to like a bit of a nasty streak, and might open up more, while others will consider you with disdain.<br><br>While the story is enjoyable, it does feel a bit more limited compared to other standouts in the genre like Consortium or Last Express. There are only a few characters, and events are more oriented around the player rather than everyone sort of having their own life.<br><br>This makes repeat playthroughs less attractive as, while the tools of the trade change things up a little from a gameplay perspective, the story doesn\u2019t appear to have much to offer beyond the end sequences.<br><br>There\u2019s also some lovely end credits that players get to explore rather than watch, including an extra room that showcases elements of the game in an alpha state when the art style was much different.<br><br>OVERALL (3.5\/5)<br><br>While Karaski: What Goes Up\u2026 is a bit rough around the edges, both visually and mechanically, it does offer a good mystery story with a variety of ways to approach it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23379800', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23379800' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23379800\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23379800' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23379800\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23379800', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23379800_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23379800_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22409622\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/altered_confusion\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"12492438\">Altered_Confusion<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTake to the skies in this whodunit mystery. You will take on the role of a passenger on this one of a kind airship, but something has gone wrong. The airship has been sabotage, but who has done it. Was it you? Will you be able to uncover who did it? Will you be caught snooping around and have everyone expect you of doing this heinous act?<br><br>In Karaski: What Goes Up... this is exactly what you'll be doing. You will be playing through the game with your main mission being to get to the bottom of the mystery of the sabotage, but there are other quests that you can take on to perhaps pry information from other passengers. In this game you will have the chance to bribe guards to look the other way, entice passengers with the promise of alcohol, and of course gain tools that will allow you access to different areas of the ship.<br><br>I'm going to be honest when I first picked up this game I didn't really get into it. I was really just running around the airship aimlessly while getting frustrated, but when I tried again from scratch and really tried to sink my teeth in I found a game where I didn't know what was going to happen next. There is definitely the need for stealth in this game, and early on I got caught ALOT. Thankfully as I played more and more of the game I was able to develop strategies of how to move around the different sections nearly undetected.<br><br>This game was a lot of fun, and there were plenty of clues that you had to be on the look out for to help solidify your case against the evildoer. There were quite a few repeat clues scattered on the ship as well, but something tells me that these locations are just the places where random items are placed so that you can experience a unique playthrough each time you play. That's right folks the person who did it in one playthrough might not actually be the the person who did it, if you were to play it again. <br><br>Graphically there was definitely a good art style going on, however sometimes it did come off as cookie cutter in certain areas where the same assets were used over and over again. Not surprisingly it was mostly the NPC guards that were all the same, the boxes\/trunks around the ship, the different bedrooms, etc. Sure there is going to be duplication of areas and items in real life, but I just feel like there should have been a little more for a personal effect in the different people's rooms. <br><br>One of the things I always hope to see is voice acting in the game, unfortunately this game does not have that component, and there are sections that have pretty lengthy conversation pieces that after a while you just want skip through and hope that they weren't too important. However that's usually when there's something key in finding out who did it.<br><br>This game might not be for everyone, there's definitely some rough spots to the game, and as I just stated there is A LOT of text to read at certain parts of the game, but I did enjoy playing the game, and I think many people out there would enjoy it as well. This game gets an 8.0 out of 10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22409622', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22409622' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22409622\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22409622' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22409622\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22409622', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22409622_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22409622_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22301874\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UniversalGamingReviews\/recommended\/424640\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"244549123\">Universal Gaming Reviews<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: A key was provided to us by Plug In Digital for review purposes.<br><br>Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers from Universal Gaming Reviews to share a short summary of our review for Karaski: What Goes Up... by Unbound Creations and Plug In Digital. If you'd like to read our full review, you can find it here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.universalgamingreviews.com\/karaski-what-goes-up-overview-and-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/www.universalgamingreviews.com\/karaski-what-goes-up-overview-and-review\/<\/a><br><br>I had a lot of fun with Karaski: What Goes Up, I'm also a pretty big fan of mystery type stuff so I knew I'd enjoy it before going into it.<br><br>The game is a who done it type mystery game where you must solve a mystery revolving around the sabatage of a commonwealth airship. You do this by exploring the airship, collecting clues, conversing with the 4 suspects and ultimately choosing who you think is the perpetrator. The game is open ended in nature so your actions during the game have an impact on the outcome of the story.<br><br>The game also incorporates some stealth elements too but they aren't punishing in terms of consequences. If you happen to get caught exploring areas you're not supposed to you can try to bribe the guard to look the other way but if you don't have the coin they'll report you to the captain and your suspicion level will go up. If your suspicion level gets too high the crime may get pinned on you in the end so you'll have to be careful. <br><br>The game is a lot of fun and only takes around 4 hours to complete and up to 5+ if you discover everything the game has to offer. Definitely a game that's worth checking out if you're a fan of mystery type adventure games.<br><br>-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22301874', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22301874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22301874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22301874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22301874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22301874', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22301874_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22301874_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/424640\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 28 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["21663298","21775729","21756442","21589707","21588021","22110887","21735345","22141015","23386419","21605511"]}
