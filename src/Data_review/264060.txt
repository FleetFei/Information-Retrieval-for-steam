Granted, it did not invent absolute novelty in the old genre. Instead, it used a different approach to it. There is a quote floating out there, &quot;metroidvania with boars&quot;. I guess you can say so, because FB features a lot of exploration aspects and freedom of movement. And more than that, a lot of puzzles with less platforming. You aren't forced to solve them (many of them are optional), but the way these placed and designed - simply attracts you like a butterfly to the light. What could be hard in simple box moving and dirt digging..?<br><br>Don't even get me started on puzzles, these are simply fantastic. They make <b>so much<\/b> sense that by the end of figuring out another one you will feel like a pure genius. They deliver insane amount of feel of accomplishment. Soon you will realize it is not about the gem or a secret you want to get or discover, it is about solving the damn puzzle that taunts you. And the most interesting part is that none of the puzzles require from you any special ability or an item - it is all knowledge and experience. The way blocks and boxes work or interact with each other and your understanding of this mechanism is the key to solve all the puzzles.<br><br>But hey, a fun gameplay is not the only thing FullBore can be proud of. Quite lovely and pretty 2D graphics with awesome lighting and &quot;fake&quot; 3D effect will catch your attention at once. They fit the game surprisingly well, just like an amazing soundtrack by &quot;The Adjective Plural Noun&quot;. But this is something you'd better to experience yourself, rather then read about in in a sloppy review.<br><br>Long story short - FullBore was quite pleasant surprise of 2013 for me (The First Dig, part 1 of the game, was released earlier; Steam version features full game). It came out of nowhere and since then I fell in love with it. Really, how could you not love these adorable little boars?<br><br><br>You won't get bored with Full Bore.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9999740', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9999740' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9999740\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9999740' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9999740\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9999740', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9999740_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9999740_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14320772\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amedeus8\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"66136147\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f23148f1983d11e57b4ede9f4b406e076499e4de.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f23148f1983d11e57b4ede9f4b406e076499e4de.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f23148f1983d11e57b4ede9f4b406e076499e4de_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amedeus8\/\" data-miniprofile=\"66136147\">Comrade St. Nikolai<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amedeus8\/games\/?tab=all\">851 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amedeus8\/recommended\/\">74 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amedeus8\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI got Full Bore as part of some bundle or other, and to be honest I wasn't really all that psyched to own it. From the images and video provided, it looked boring. Okay, you're a boar and you dig. <i>Great<\/i>.<br><br>I'm more than pleased to report that Full Bore may have honestly been the best game I received in that bundle.<br><br>Full Bore is a game that is both cute and dark. You have boars who are also miners and say cute boar miner things and are named things like Hamm. You also have experimentation, possession, and sacrifice. The dark stuff never gets <i>overly<\/i> dark, though, and the worst bits are described in historical texts and frozen computer monitors, and never in any horrific detail.<br><br>The game begins with Hildi or Frederick (your choice) slumbering in a meadow. After chasing some butterflies into a minefield, they are blown up and fall many, many stories below ground. They are then revived by some strange technology, and spend some time getting acquainted with the controls and bashing their head into things. Then they're launched in a rocket, through the bottom of a vault.<br><br>Your preferred swine arrives just after some mysterious masked boar runs off, leaving you behind to take the blame for the vault's missing contents. Turns out, this vault belongs to the owner of the Full Bore mining company, and he's not about to let you off the hook with his riches vanished. You're pushed into another pit and sent off to recover the gem hoard.<br><br>There are two main aspects of this game: puzzle solving and exploration. If you're a fan of both, then this may be the game for you! Puzzles tend to consist primarily of the destruction and manipulation of blocks. All sorts of blocks. Dirt, sand, crates, levitating, weird colored blocks that all phase in or out of existence if you destroy any one of them... Gems are found inside blocks, and puzzles often revolve around finding ways to reach these gem blocks, and finding ways to <i>destroy<\/i> the gem blocks. Discovering and reaching doors is another huge part, as you'll have to first get to the rooms containing the gems. And you'll find that there are more than a few mysterious secrets buried beneath the world's crust.<br><br>The puzzle difficulty varies as you go. Obviously the general difficulty raises some as you get further, but you'll find puzzles of all difficulties throughout. It's understandable if you get stuck and look up some help, though this is definitely the type of game where it helps to step away for a few hours, or overnight. As you delve further, it's natural to start burning out after several rooms. I had numerous occasions where I just couldn't find any possible solution, then came back the next day and solved it in seconds.<br><br>Different areas have different gimmicks to their puzzles. The toughest area of the game is filled almost entirely with things that will break as you step off of them, leading to some very unique challenges. It's honestly pretty impressive how much variety this game's puzzles contain, considering that everything is just digging and pushing and stomping.<br><br>There's a nice, rewarding feeling when you accomplish something, too. Even a simpler challenge leaves you pretty proud of yourself. Collecting a gem and seeing your PigBoar Color's gem counter tick up one is great, but honestly most everything you do gives you a satisfying feeling of progress. Part of this is due to the obviously Fez-inspired map system, which tells you if there are any gems, doors, lore, or mysteries left in any given room. As you collect gems, they'll stack up, 1:1, in the previously emptied vault. Lore fills in the pieces of the plot, if you're into that. The mysteries... do what they do. And often, when you do some puzzling to reach a new door, upon your return you'll find that the room has undergone a subtle change to facilitate future passage to the door. Scaffolding will appear, dirt will disappear, crates will shift, all because the devs understood that nobody wants to have to solve that darn thing again in order to get back to a room that they had difficulty with the first time.<br><br>I mentioned Fez, there. The game has a few inspirations that aren't entirely obvious, at first. I am full-on bragging when I say that I noticed these three early on into the game. The first thing I noticed was a bit of a Metroid-esque feel (but without the upgrades), along with those Prime-style digital and ancient lore logs. Then the very clear Fez map and the pool puzzles (bonus points for the fox\/dog that occupies the room where you learn how those work) and a certain room named &quot;Vision&quot; (which I actually think is slightly cleverer than Fez's counterpart). And I was thinking it was probably because I'd just recently replayed Escape Goat, but the game reminded me of that at times, as well. Lo and behold, then, when I stumbled upon direct references to each of the above! So if you're a fan of those three games\/series, then once again, this may be the game for you!<br><br>There are a few endgame-type-deals which will drop you back to the title screen. You can always continue your game after these, picking up after your credit-causing conquests. You should never find yourself in a position where 100% is impossible.<br><br>I know it's a puzzle game, but there are times where you'll need to be quick. It never asks the impossible, but you will be thankful for the rewind feature when you find yourself racing the character you didn't pick at the beginning, or desperately running from exploding purple... stuff. Or <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>fighting the final\/only boss<\/span><\/span>, which is tricky in its first part, rough in its second, and downright tedious and not very fun at all in its last.<br><br>I understand if the visuals don't appeal to you right off the bat, but you'll enjoy them more and more as you go. The lighting is done well, and the game can be rather pretty when it wants to. The soundtrack is cool, too, providing something to dig on while you dig on. Lots of distorted guitars laying down fitting grooves to keep you focused and immersed.<br><br>If I have to come up with a complaint that nagged at me over the course of the game, it's the camera. Generally it's centered on you, but you can also use the right analog stick (assuming you're using a controller) to look around. I assume this is just remapped keyboard keys, though, as the camera does not register the sensitivity of your tilt. This means that you can't just move the camera slightly to view an entire puzzle. The camera will shift as far as it can - up to something like a full screen's length away - and sit there. If I'm trying to see at a distance, that's fine. But when I want a better look at the puzzle I'm working on, I have to keep shifting the camera up and back and up and back instead of just looking slightly up and taking it all in. Also, on a few occasions the camera just wigged out on me. It didn't happen often, but on the few occasions that it did, it could be pretty screwy on the eyes.<br><br>I really, really enjoyed Full Bore. Far more than I ever expected to. It has good design, enjoyable writing, and most of all it has heart. It's not stuffed with references, but there are a small handful, along with bits of inspiration seeped in from strong sources and in all the right ways. Plus, wow, I got around 20+ hours out of this, and I didn't get tired of the game once through all that (okay, maybe a little bit in the Scrapyard). That's excellent for a block-manipulation indie puzzle game. If all that sounds as delightful to you as it does to me, then this is definitely the game for you.<br><br>I'll leave you with one piece of closing wisdom: remember that, in that moment before a block falls, when it's hovering Wile E. Coyote-style in the air, you can actually hop onto it and use it as a platform. Knowing this ahead of time would have spared me one big headache.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14320772', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14320772' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14320772\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14320772' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14320772\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14320772', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14320772_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14320772_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11864790\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/blaxpirit\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"50094956\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3ed629f86f08b65bfaea96fc7450afc65cdfff6f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3ed629f86f08b65bfaea96fc7450afc65cdfff6f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3ed629f86f08b65bfaea96fc7450afc65cdfff6f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/blaxpirit\/\" data-miniprofile=\"50094956\">BlaXpirit<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/blaxpirit\/games\/?tab=all\">829 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/blaxpirit\/recommended\/\">53 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/blaxpirit\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter playing <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/38700\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Toki Tori<\/a> and <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/111800\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Blocks That Matter<\/a> I started to think that I dislike such games... but now I realize that Full Bore is simply the first good tile-based puzzler that I've played. And all the competition pales in comparison.<br><br>Notice that I didn't use the word &quot;platformer&quot;. Well, that's because I associate the word with jumping, action, reflexes, etc. And that's not what Full Bore is about, don't be fooled by the trailers. Sure, there are a few places that require quick action, but you don't need any of the qualities required by typical platformers. The stop time+rewind feature mitigates this even more. Oh, and... you actually <i>can't jump<\/i>.<br>Full Bore is quite a pure puzzle game. Everything, including the character, is always aligned to the tile grid. And the puzzles... they are extremely well designed and all very different. It's just hard to imagine how someone could come up with such a variety of puzzles, while keeping the set of concepts limited and so elegant.<br>To be clear here, Full Bore is a difficult game, but never too difficult. To me the difficulty always seemed just perfect. Every puzzle felt rewarding. And I never got stuck for too long (taking a break always helped).<br><br>About the open world thing... The world map is a lot like the one you see in <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/224760\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >FEZ<\/a>. But all the rooms also have &quot;thumbnails&quot;, and connections between them are shown very clearly. Rooms where there is nothing left to do are indicated as well. A portal system prevents travel from being tedious.<br>And since I started this whole FEZ topic... It is clear that some inspiration is drawn from it, and yes, there are <i>secrets<\/i> in Full Bore. But finding them, and eventually completing the game 100% is something actually doable. Without guides, that is. All the secrets have good hints for them, and there definitely are no obscure and outright impossible to find secrets (unlike in FEZ).<br><br>Full Bore can easily give you 25 hours of gameplay (this is about the minimal time that you need to explore everything, if you don't look up solutions, of course). Since I knew right away that I was going for full completion, I don't really know how much time it would take to just complete the story, while mostly ignoring optional tasks. Maybe 5 hours, maybe 10. There is even a &quot;preliminary&quot; ending that may let you consider the game completed, if you so choose.<br><br>What is also very nice, you can never lock yourself out of something; no location, secret, ending or achievement is missable (well, to be honest, one achievement does explicitly require a separate playthrough, but don't concern yourself with this). Explore freely without worry.<br><br>Controls are simple. Redefinable. No problems with them.<br>Soundtrack is great.<br>Graphics are immaculate.<br><br>Full Bore deserves so much more love than it gets. Really is a hidden <i>gem<\/i> (haha).<br><br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11864790', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11864790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11864790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11864790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11864790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11864790', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11864790_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11864790_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10032767\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999647773\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"39382045\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/9561d6d2da2e4805bc0bc74f88d7856950412c47.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/9561d6d2da2e4805bc0bc74f88d7856950412c47.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/9561d6d2da2e4805bc0bc74f88d7856950412c47_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999647773\/\" data-miniprofile=\"39382045\">ErsatzDragon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999647773\/games\/?tab=all\">800 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999647773\/recommended\/\">39 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999647773\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStands confidently alongside Escape Goat and Toki Tori 2 as a truly great puzzle platformer.

It's like the honor-roll love child of Cave Story, Castlevania SOTN, and Adventures of Lolo, with maybe a streak of Portal. Simply fantastic. <br><br>I don't have enough good things to say about this game. If you are on the fence, just buy it. Even if you don't like it, the devs deserve your money. I feel like I need to spread the word about this game, so more people will buy it. This is a sleeper for sure, and it's a real tragedy it didn't sell like hotcakes. <br><br>I guess I'll write a short summary about why I liked it so much. The game is an open world block puzzler. That may not sound like the greatest thing ever, but the world the devs have created oozes mystery and begs you to explore every nook and cranny to find both it's arcane secrets, and to find more puzzles to solve simply for the sake of solving more. The exploration has the same sense of wonder that SOTN or Dark Souls has, but without any real enemies to speak of. And without the stress of Dark Souls constant deaths. And when you finally do find all the pieces, the story is quite compelling, well thought out, and plotted at a masterful pace (despite the occasional typo or misspelling). The pixel art is sometimes amazing, and sometimes just ok, but they do some kind of 2D normal mapping or something to have this neat dynamic lighting. It looks great sometimes, but sometimes it looks like prerendered graphics from late 16bit early 32bit era stuff. The music is also amazing. Good tunes that are appropriate to the scene when they need to be, and entertaining when you are working out puzzles.<br><br>Things I didn't like...Not much. The occasional puzzle stumped me, but that's cause I'm too dumb. I ended up having to look up 2 of the puzzles on Youtube, which I'm fine with. Most of the time when I got stuck I would put the game down and come back later and something would pop out at me. The time rewind mechanic was helpful, but it often didn't go where you wnated it to go, and that was annoying. The race can suck it, the control just isn't built for it, and I frankly didn't find it fun. But those are totally forgiveable complaints in the grand scheme of how amazing this is. <br><br>Probably in my top 20 gmes of all-time.<br><br>BUY IT!<br><br>Devs: I liked Full Bore on FB, but you guys don't have a developer page. I'd love to be able to follow you so at least I can keep abreast of any new projects.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16255043', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16255043' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16255043\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16255043' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16255043\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16255043', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16255043_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16255043_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10031132\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cosmicengine\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"107024896\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/10d6358a8f4f7897f97ec54d1a16107779fbe6c0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/10d6358a8f4f7897f97ec54d1a16107779fbe6c0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/10d6358a8f4f7897f97ec54d1a16107779fbe6c0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cosmicengine\/\" data-miniprofile=\"107024896\">Cosmic Engine<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cosmicengine\/games\/?tab=all\">427 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cosmicengine\/recommended\/\">96 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cosmicengine\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Full Bore on April 29, 2014, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFull Video Review here - <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/Sha3pSRoKE4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/Sha3pSRoKE4<\/a><br><br>Full Bore is a indie 2D puzzle platformer developed by three man studio Whole Hog Games. The game was Kickstarted just over a year ago to the tune of $16,383.Full Bore has lovely 2d 16 bit pixelated graphics that not only add a retro feel, but add a degree of both humour and charm to the title. Environments look great with some really well designed levels, nice use of lighting. Levels are colourful and vibrant and the whole game is easy to look at. The soundtrack of the game is also wonderful created by Miguel Acu\u00f1a and the Adjective Plural Noun. It boasts a great variety of tracks that range from happy go lucky to dark and atmospheric.<br><br>The games controls are simple and easy to use, movement is controlled with WASD. The space bar is used to make the boar stomp, which is used for crumbling loose blocks of ground and for moving certain blocks. Sadly there\u2019s no jump feature which on one hand is necessary for the way the game is designed but I personally would have liked one. One thing I like is that you get all the abilities you need in the game at the start, as levels increase in difficulty its all about using your brain rather than just using in game abilities. <br><br>Full Bore has three main elements to it's gameplay, puzzles, platforming and exploration. Full Bore isn't just a level by level platformer, you have a world to explore. By entering different doors and entrances you can go to different locations. To manage where you are and find your way around you have the handy tool of having a world map so you can track you way back should you need to. As you explore you'll come across computer control panels, books and characters, all of which you can interact with which will progress the games story, offer information and some funny jokes.<br><br>Full Bore is a highly polished indie title that is packed full of character, humour and a bloody good challenge. It brings back memories of playing Fez for the first time and I would certainly argue that its up there with Fez in terms of indie titles in the puzzle platforming genre. All in all if your a fan of puzzle platformers or just charming indie titles in general I would certainly recommend picking Full Bore up, there\u2019s plenty here to get your monies worth and you'll get a laugh or two out of it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10031132', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10031132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10031132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10031132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10031132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10031132', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10031132_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10031132_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10542288\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fleskesvor\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"54123450\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bca01944ed5168f00f99344f8e967bfdd284a73.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bca01944ed5168f00f99344f8e967bfdd284a73.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bca01944ed5168f00f99344f8e967bfdd284a73_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fleskesvor\/\" data-miniprofile=\"54123450\">flesk<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fleskesvor\/games\/?tab=all\">939 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fleskesvor\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fleskesvor\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">45.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 19, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAt first glance, Full Bore might look like a mix of Toki Tori and SteamWorld Dig. It is indeed a block puzzler with digging, but what really sets it apart from similar games is the exploration aspect, the non-linearity and the lore.<br><br>The gameplay consists of solving puzzles to progress through a vast underground world. Since you can only move by running, falling or leaping diagonally, many puzzles revolve around clearing a path or building steps to reach exits. Because of the large variation in materials you can dig through, or make crumble or fall by stomping, and the many different kinds of crates, no two puzzles in the game feel the same. At least one puzzle even have an additional solution to uncover a secret passage. And as far as puzzle games go, I've played none other with such a huge amount of secrets and collectibles.<br><br>Full Bore has a metroidvania-esque map, where collectible gems and lore, along with passages and mysteries are marked. The map is similar to that of FEZ, with lines connecting all the discovered passages and completed rooms being marked in yellow. New rooms are added to the map as you discover them and are displayed as a small preview, annotated with anything left to discover. This is handy both for figuring out which way you should take to progress the story and is great for completionists.<br><br>The game is full of references to games that likely inspired the creators. I caught references to Metroid, Offspring Fling!, Escape Goat and FEZ, but I'm sure I also missed many. The Escape Goat and FEZ references are both elegantly incorporated into the game as puzzles that works well alongside its other puzzles, while still being true to their inspirations. The FEZ puzzle especially being a nice throwback to the more meta puzzles of the indie classic.<br><br>This unique game already has a place among my absolute favourites. It says something about this game that I've played it almost compulsively for a total of more than 30 hours the past week without experiencing any of the fatigue that I normally associate with puzzle games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10542288', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10542288' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10542288\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10542288' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10542288\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10542288', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10542288_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10542288_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12364733\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045248630\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"84982902\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa201cddbc57e4ef66bbcd2c25a70dae29af13d4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa201cddbc57e4ef66bbcd2c25a70dae29af13d4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa201cddbc57e4ef66bbcd2c25a70dae29af13d4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045248630\/\" data-miniprofile=\"84982902\">Adelion<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045248630\/games\/?tab=all\">173 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045248630\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045248630\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">26.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCute, isn't it? <b>Full bore<\/b> has a charming and rather untalkative main character. You can either play as Frederick or Hildi through the story. It starts with your &quot;crash&quot; into the vault of Gullinbursti who then accuses you of theft and forces you to recollect his valued gems. Although this goal will be set aside after clearing the first of the five areas (Workings, Deep Dive, Bhudevi, Scrapyard and the sleepless sea all with different style and desgin) of the game and the real story will unfold from there.<br><br>And here I will state the most important aspect of the game (as I see it). The game heavily relies on your urge to explore, to search, to figure out:<br>- for the story: It tells you sometimes where you can find some story characters but gives you no explicit directions. You have to run around searching for them. To understand the story itself you need discover and read the various terminals spread through the different areas<br>- for the gameplay: It tells you how to stomp, how to climb and that you can dig. But how the different blocks behave you have to figure out yourself.<br>For you not to run around in circles too much and to reduce unnecessary backtracking a bit there are two &quot;systems&quot; implemented. The first one is that every puzzle is solvable the moment you discover it. If you can't solve it than only because you are unable to figure out the solution not because you are missing equipment. The second it that on the map at the bottom of every room there is listed if you can still discover something in said room.<br><br>The difficulty in the puzzles differs from very very easy to hard where the harder puzzles are mostly related to the &quot;second ending&quot; of the game or obtaining gems. Also the puzzle change from area to area. So the scrapyard plays differently then Bhudevi for example. <br><br>All of this is rounded up with a nice soundtrack. So if you have an explorative nature (up to 20+ hours of gameplay), you like the graphic style and you like puzzle platformers (and adore boars) I can only recommand  <b>Full bore<\/b> to you.<br><br><br>PS: If you have any questions regarding the game, ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12364733', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12364733' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12364733\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12364733' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12364733\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12364733', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12364733_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12364733_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21488620\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/slowacki\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"125443418\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/4585acb510f8439dfffb55b830f596abfb103831.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/4585acb510f8439dfffb55b830f596abfb103831.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/4585acb510f8439dfffb55b830f596abfb103831_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/slowacki\/\" data-miniprofile=\"125443418\">Slowacki<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/slowacki\/games\/?tab=all\">1,924 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/slowacki\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/slowacki\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe action of Full Bore takes place in a post-apocalyptic world(?), where a new sentient race of boarkind (and a few more animals) is ruling. It's a puzzle platformer in which the player controls Hildi, a boar that is accused of stealing gems from a vault of a digging company owner. As a punishment, it's sent into the mines to retrieve all the stolen treasures. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay &amp; Level Design <\/div><br>The game is a puzzle platformer, which means the (almost) only gameplay is solving environmental puzzles with your own hands (hooves?). The player has the access to a map that allows to check, if there is still something left to explore in each location, which saves the time greatly and indicates the general direction of where should one proceed. To solve the puzzles, one usually needs to dig through or move some blocks. If mistakes were made, it's always possible to &quot;rewind time&quot; to specific moments, so that it's possible to take off where the last right step was made. On your way down (or up), more and more secrets are discovered that put the story into context. The game is an open-world one - there's no requirement to explore many of the maps, but they often hold some additional information about the past of the world or extra gems. Moving throughout the locations and maps takes some time, but a mechanism of fast travel makes it pretty convenient.<br><br>The puzzle solving is actually really absorbing and fun. First puzzles are rather straightforward, but the game gets progressively harder with new locations. There seems to be a big spike in difficulty at one point towards the end, where puzzles get really challenging and it wasn't unusual for me to spend up to half an hour solving one problem. <br><br>The controls are smooth and reactive, which is really important for a platformer. The only issue I had was with jumping down from blocks, where the boar is somewhat hesitant to do so, which costs some extra time, so much needed in many scenarios. Another thing that I found a bit disappointing is that, there seems to be no use for gems and most of the items. I mean, I wouldn't really like to see collecting those a requirement to finish the game, but an additional incentive would be ever so nice. Because of that, the last few maps, I just went straight to where I needed to go, without caring much about clearing the locations thoroughly.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div><br>I found the pixel graphics in the game very appealing. Surface is nice, cheerful and green, while digging deeper and exploring lower maps brings some darker and more volcanic colours into play. The main characters are made carefully and look really pretty (like the shaman), their animations and also animations in general are also nice and smooth. Overall, I found the graphical design really charming and detailed enough to be able to keep my attention, but not too crowded to obscure the view of the objectives.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Story <\/div><br>As I've already mentioned, at some point I've noticed that going for gems and collectibles is not too rewarding, however, I kept on exploring. The reason for that is the story or more like - the history. The story itself is pretty straightforward and could be probably written down on one page of paper. Still, throughout the game, it's possible to find notes and terminal data that introduces the player to what actually happened before the current game world existed. Maybe, it's just me being a fun of post-apocalyptic settings, but after completing the game, I've spent some time reading the other players' theories on the in-game history, just out of curiosity.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Music and Sound<\/div><br>The background music is quite catchy and I never felt the urge to mute it, as I sometimes do in many games. It changes from location to location, each one has its own tune. Changing maps also changes the music sometimes to a different variation on a theme. It definitely wasn't a kind of a music I'd listen on a daily basis or while commuting to work, but it was really fitting to the game and just sounded nice and right.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Content<\/div><br>It took me almost 10h to beat the game, but if one wants to be really thorough and get all of the collectibles, I think there would be somewhat 20-30 hours of playing there. Shame that except for achievements there's little incentive to go for it all. Still, I believe this is a really decent amount of content and fun for a cheap little game. It kept me interested and it was always fun to try and solve the puzzles to get some more diamonds or reach more lore secrets and that's what's important to me.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall<\/div><br>Full Bore is a really solid indie game, all pieces just fall right into place. The puzzles are just challenging enough to keep one entertained and thinking, but not too hard, discovering the lore is actually quite interesting, the graphics are all nice and charming and the music just completes the image of a well-made game. I probably wouldn't pay the full price for it, but it's a great catch if it's bundled or on a discount. So, if it's discounted somewhere and you want to put your brain to some work, grab it - you won't regret it (probably).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21488620', 'summary' );

Don't expect to get any special abilites or to level up. The variations in gameplay come from the levels, and there's way more variation than you'd think when you start. Except for a couple of optional puzzles, no puzzle is unfair. They're well thought out, some of them giving you face-palming epiphanies when you finally get how they work.<br><br>The story though...oh man. You can finish the game in less than 10 hrs if you don't care for the story or to complete all the puzzles. But you'd be doing yourself a diservice, beyond the fact that it's worth it to actually play the puzzles. Without spoilers, this story of a mining boar goes deep. It deals with philosophy, religion, quantum physics... There's a neat mystery that you can put together if you take the time to do it.<br><br>Definitely recommend it.

There is no jump button, instead you solve environmental puzzles through digging, bashing, climbing pushing, etc.  A few sections have some timing elements but you should be well prepared once you encounter them.  There is also a smartly implemented rewind system so you can correct any missteps you might have made.  Has a large map with varied environments.  Shortcuts eventually open up to alieve some backtracking issues.  Charming pixel art with only one character sprite I had a difficult time discerning what I was looking at.  Interesting game world and a story keeps things moving, with a few twists, but doesn't really get in the way of the gameplay.  Particularly good soundtrack as well.  Followed this all the way from Greenlight and is one of the best experiences out of that system.  Played on a shared account (close to 50 hrs for all but two achievements) for reference.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29259120', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29259120' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29259120\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29259120' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29259120\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29259120', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29259120_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29259120_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29140583\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/PeanutsKill\/recommended\/264060\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"87313018\">Peanut (They kill me)<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 42.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFull Bore is type of puzzle game I never thought I would have had so much fun playing.

Instead of, therefore, saving some orphans just so that they'll get burnt in the apocalyptic wildfire 2017 is sure to bring, I'm reviewing a game I really like, yet somehow never got off the ground. This is charity work, and I can declare it on my taxes.<br><br>I think I got Full Bore in a bundle last year, and I played it more or less just to humor it. To my surprise, 25 hours later (I think around that timespan, this is a LONG game), I had 100%ed it. This happened for a few reasons.<br><br><b>1) I have some form of mental illness that results in utter hatred of leaving a puzzle unsolved.<\/b><br><br>This happens every time I get my hands on a well-designed puzzle game. I play it an unhealthy amount of time, to the point where I put off my real-life responsibilities as much as possible. It's probably indicative of some greater underlying mental health issue, likely having to do with that summer at camp I can't remember.<br><br><b>2) The actual game I bought the bundle for SUCKED.<\/b><br><br>I can't for the life of me recall what that game was, but I remember being upset enough to slip into a rage-induced coma, probably one that explains why I didn't review Full Bore when I actually played it.<br><br><b>3) Full Bore is packed with Boar and Bore puns.<\/b><br><br>In preparation for someday being a father, despite reason #1's clear indication that perhaps I shouldn't, I am attempting to construct an encyclopaedia of ghastly jokes to embarrass my offspring with, and this game helped.<br><br>So, onto the game proper, and why I think I like it more than almost any other 2D puzzle game I can recall:<br><br>Simply put, it has the same sort of elegant design eventually found in The Witness. Every puzzle is solvable from the moment you start the game. However, they are all reliant on a complex ruleset that will not, initially, make much sense. You must learn and explore to determine how to progress, and the knowledge gained applies to earlier puzzles that may have seemed impossible at the time. The game will never tell you how to solve a puzzle - it's entirely on you - and each solution requires its own little ah-ha moment.<br><br>This results in a constant cycle of feeling stupid, and smart, in a way that I find more addictive than crack.<br><br>This game is impeccably designed in that regard. It's not exactly a looker per se, but the design is so fundamentally good, I can't help but recommend.<br><br>Right, now onto trying to find something else to scratch my moronic puzzle itch before I have to deal with celebrating the birth of some guy with a cute beard.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28521824', 'recent_short' );
