It just needs over the next upcoming months more polishing..<\/div><br>There isn`t really much to say about the Game in it`s current form. It`s enjoyable for those that liked those 80' &amp; 90' Video Games like Ghosts n' Goblins, Wonderboy or similar Video Games.<br><br>The Demo does give a pretty decent overlook of what the Full Game will contain and after the first couple of minutes where I got used to the Control System in the Game I started to enjoy my time with the Game.<br><br>After a short introduction you will be left along in the Game and afterwards encounter after two section the first Boss Fight that will probably feel very familiar if you have played other Games in this Genre.<br><br>Besides that you can run around a bit in the Overworld to get a better unterstanding of how big the Game might be in the end and considering how many collectible Toys are in the Game I really believe when the Developer said that the Overall Gameplay Length might be around eigth hours in your first Gameplay Walkthrough.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion:<\/div><br>Besides a couple of technical issues here and there that weren`t really any major issues that wouldn`t be fixed very easy I got the overall feeling that the Game was already by now very polished and that the Developer indeed only needs a couple of more months to tweak the Game here and there and afterwards focus more on the later Levels in the Game.<br><br>At the current moment the Game is being sold for around $20 on Kickstarter <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/(https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/causalbitgames\/battle-princess-madelyn)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >(https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/causalbitgames\/battle-princess-madelyn)<\/a> and I guess it will launch on Kickstarter later this year or early 2018 at an price tag of $19,99.<br><br>Considering all this and after reading a bit more about what`s still left in the Game I am giving the Game a very strong <br><br><i>Thumbs Up.<\/i><br><br>That\u00b4s it.
