In the months since then, the game's developers have worked hard to improve it, with occasional but comprehensive updates happening every few months. The devs were very responsive to feedback and addressed the issues that players had been bringing up.

I must say, I'm very impressed so far.<br><br>You're given a nice storyline to begin with and continue from there.  The tutorial will get you familiar with the basic aspect of the game, but from there you're on your own and I like it.  This game is definitely challenging right off the bat and that is something I was looking for.<br><br>If you enjoy simulations and having to plan out almost every move from the very beginning, you should give this a try.  It looks quite promising for the future assuming the devs can keep providing updates.<br><br>Some personal thoughts\/experiences:<br>- I feel as though the combat is almost too difficult at the start.  I found myself struggling even on the first couple of tracks out of the first town.  After a few tries I was able to figure out what needed to be done, but it was very challenging.<br>- I don't think you are given enough money to begin with and\/or aren't rewarded enough for completing missions.  I was struggling for cash to even afford the licenses needed to get to the first few cities.<br>- Hardcore mode is turned on by default; I think it should be turned off<br>- Dialog windows could use some work, maybe separate chat boxes instead?<br>- After you select a target and give it a command, you need to reselect the target.  I think if you select a target it should stay selected until you escape out and\/or select somewhere in the field<br>- Reload times are way too long<br>- The Perks are an interesting aspect to the game, though I think some of the power-ups need better descriptions (i.e. What does Willpower do?)<br><br>I will be playing this game again and look forward to what the devs have in store for the future.  For now, I think maybe turning DOWN the diffuculty of the battles would be a good idea in order to explore more of the game and allow for a bit more income in the early game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17718132', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17718132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17718132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17718132' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17718132\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17718132', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17718132_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17718132_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23601884\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"30875083\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/639feb61815e2f581bfe5db69e632b4d053ac5cf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/\" data-miniprofile=\"30875083\">TeeJax &lt;3<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/games\/?tab=all\">5,137 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/recommended\/\">71 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TeeJaxOff\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bounty Train is an Early Access game with amazing gameplay that combines elements from multiple genres perfectly to create a well rounded enjoyable game.<\/b><br><br><b>Early Access<\/b><br>Bounty Train is currently in Early Access but I\u2019ve found more than enough content to keep me happy (I want to note that others who I know who have played the game have said they wanted more content which i found a little surprising). The developers seem active with updates coming every few months fixing minor issues usually like bugs or adding small features. I am unsure on just how complete the game is as I have been unable to find a roadmap but there are features they plan to implement that aren\u2019t there yet so I imagine there is still some development due. <br><br><b>Story<\/b><br>The story is rather simple. Your father has died and left you his train and shares in his railway company but the other investors want to change the company. You must embark on a quest to find your siblings and convince them to see things your way as with their shares you are majority shareholder. The story isn\u2019t massively fleshed out but it does it\u2019s job of giving you a reason for the gameplay. I do hope a little more is added to the story or at least the main quest because currently I have very little feeling or care towards anyone i\u2019ve met, even my own family members\u2026<br>It seems the story is there to act as a tutorial and not too much else.<br><br><b>General Gameplay<\/b><br>The gameplay of Bounty Train is absolutely fantastic. You start with a basic steam train and just yourself, from there you must travel from city to city delivering cargo and passengers, helping strangers, importing and smuggling goods hiring crew and making money to build up your train.<br>Your train starts with the basics a locomotive for travel, a passenger carriage, cargo carriage and crew carriage. You\u2019ll need at least one of each of these even as you customize your train and buy new parts. If you find yourself short of funds you can always leave a nonessential part of your train behind to pick up later or just sell it if you feel you no longer need it. Every part of your train can be replaced or upgraded adding a fantastic amount of customization and allowing you to focus on whatever you feel makes money faster (smuggling goods, transporting passengers, raiding camps). <br>You travel from city to city along your railway routes paying to unlock new routes as you travel and running into random encounters, new side quests and meeting new factions and groups of people, sometimes traders, sometimes people looking for help and others who need work. Most of the games events are randomized so you never really know what\u2019s coming leading you to always be prepared for anything.<br>Aside from the side quests you\u2019ll find like taking passengers from city to city or traporting goods you also have the ability to take advantage of the everchanging economy.by utilizing the market. There will often be shortages of various goods in other cities and buying them out of your own pocket and delivering them is a fantastic way to earn money, though often overlooked.<br>Along your route you\u2019ll find yourself able to earn reputation at the various cities you pass through making trading cheaper there but sometimes opening other opportunities too. Cities are not the only places you can earn reputation though, there are different \u2018factions\u2019 you\u2019ll encounter and the way you handle yourself in various situations and quests will define\/influence the way you are treated by these people when you encounter them next. Once again this can hugely impact just how successful you are in the game.<br>Different cities you travel to will have different resources and amenities. Some will have a hospital so injured crew can rest whilst others will have saloons for the more shady quests, or banks so you can deposit money to gain interest like a good little saver! Each town sells different goods at the market and some will even sell guns when guns are prohibited in other cities. Each city depot will also supply different parts of your train so travelling around a lot is highly recommended for the best gameplay experience as every town is a little different to the last.<br><br><b>Sound and Graphics<\/b><br>The graphics are lovely on my desktop and the game runs really smoothly. I love seeing my train coursing along the track, steam billowing from the engines as I outrun the bandits. The towns are clean and rather beautiful to look at, even if there isn\u2019t too much going on.<br>The sound is great also, you\u2019ll feel like you are really driving your own train which the chuckachuckachucka of your train moving along the tracks, the loud train horn to spook the horses who are chasing you down and the bandits gunfire. The towns and cities are full of people murmuring and going about their everyday life. The sound is just wonderfully immersive. I would appreciate a little more of a soundtrack but that\u2019s personal preference and it doesn\u2019t NEED it at all.<br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Start menu tracks are fantastic. I love the \u2018My country, tis of thee\u2019 which uses the tune of \u2018God save the Queen\u2019 which is delightfully amusing in my opinion considering it just makes me think of England.<\/span><\/span><br><br><b>Pros<\/b><br>--- Vast train customization and upgrades.<br>--- Side quests that you can choose and play at your own pace.<br>--- Historically accurate (for the most part).<br>--- Randomized events, passengers and side quests allowing for masses of replayability.<br>--- Different crew members with a nicely refined leveling system.<br>--- \u2018Factions\u2019 and reputation that changes as you play depending on how you interact with people.<br>--- Lots of control over your train, your staff, where you go and what you do. <br>--- In game economywith a brilliant trading system.<br><br><b>Cons<\/b><br>--- Starting a new game wiped my previous game for some reason. I inadvertently wiped three hours of gameplay whilst trying to show my friend the start of the game.<br>--- Combat is a little difficult and at times redundant. It\u2019s a lot more fun to avoid combat entirely and if you can\u2019t I advise you pick \u2018escape\u2019 over \u2018attack\u2019.<br>--- Randomized events + passengers can make or break your run. If no-one wants to go to a city you\u2019re headed to you\u2019ll go bankrupt very quickly.<br>--- Repairs + healing take a long time. (Will be fixed in next update)<br>--- No ability to see the map whilst in town so you cannot plan your routes properly or choose which passengers you want to take without opening and closing your map. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>This is a huge issue because if you are smuggling weapons it counts and leaving the town and re-entering meaning you have a chance of getting caught AGAIN. Please fix this, it\u2019s so tedious and jumping back and forth between screens is so annoying.<\/span><\/span> (Another thing that the devs are fixing)<br>--- DLC on sale before full release. Sorry devs, i\u2019ll always have an issue with this and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019ll change my mind on this negative fact. Don\u2019t sell part of your game, sell it all or don\u2019t bother. I have no issue with soundtrack and artbook being sold seperately, I would have bought them, but if this game is going to be a DLC spawner from the start then this review won\u2019t stay positive for long. <br><br><b>Summary<\/b><br>Overall I am loving Bounty Train and I know this will be a game I play to finish over and over. The blending of simulation style games with strategy and implementing some fantastic historical events makes Bounty Train feel like a refreshing addition to Steam. Despite the combat being a tad repetitive every other element of the game holds itself well and the gameplay is ridiculously addictive. There is a lot of content already with the general gameplay feeling mostly complete and very, very fun. The price may be steep for some people but for those who really enjoy this style of gameplay it\u2019s worth every single penny, and if that\u2019s not enough to push your hand, grab it in a sale, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23601884', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23601884' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23601884\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23601884' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23601884\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23601884', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23601884_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23601884_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17725701\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"62595248\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/601ef2586c2ea5d162cf57c50a653a9692d4d717.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/601ef2586c2ea5d162cf57c50a653a9692d4d717.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/601ef2586c2ea5d162cf57c50a653a9692d4d717_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/\" data-miniprofile=\"62595248\">weemcast<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/games\/?tab=all\">355 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/recommended\/\">38 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mikeweem\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 26, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[Early Quick Look] This is trains on the PC like we don't usually get.

I wasn't a fan of Daedelic after I played their Blackguards title. I thought that it was a snooze fest. When I found out that this game didn't seem to have the visibility I have gotten used to with other devs via a weekly or monthly update (or some type of roadmap), it gave me more cause for pause. <br><br>However, I watched a few videos and looked through the comments section and it seems that the devs do seem to respond to people's concerns and questions...so I gave it a whirl.<br><br>I like the setting, concept, and gameplay so far. It is a lot deeper than I anticipated. This is Corbie Games first effort to my knowlege, so that gives me hope that they will continue development on this already fun game. My only fear is that they hooked up with a publisher which means a steeper entry fee- one that may discourage newer players from supporting this great game. <br><br>In short, it's like FTL in a western setting, with a lot of historical flavor mixed with fiction. I don't know what kind of staying power it has in its current state (it does have sandbox mode which is a huge plus), but many reviewers have tens of hundreds of hours with it already.<br><br>I haven't run into any gamebreaking bugs, just a few minor glitches with the questing system and perhaps could use a few additional tooltips. But those are minor gripes for an EA title. <br><br>I've only played for a couple of hours, but the game is fun so far.  Art style is great and music is pretty good. Thumbs up from me.

The game akes place in the 19th century during the American Civil War and puts you in charge of a train and its crew, as you make your way down the coast of the USA while trying to make a profit.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall gameplay impressions<\/div><br>Despite the fact that the tutorial is somewhat short, it teachs you, or at least gives you some slight insight, on pretty much all the basic things you should know before you first play the game. You can choose to play the normal sandbox mode or hardcore mode, which doesn\u2019t let you save, meaning there is no going back once you mess up. After completing the tutorial I found that while the tutorial does teach you how to properly control the train, I rarely found myself controlling the train in that very same way as I played the game when completing missions and whatnot. I feel like you don\u2019t have that much of control over your train as I\u2019d hope for.<br><br>As you travel through the railroad system, and you need to purchase access to new railroads in order to use them, you\u2019ll eventually come across bandits or other factions which you\u2019ll engage on combat depending on how you decide to approach them. Combat is real-time, with the option to pause, and everytime you\u2019re in combat your objective is to defend your train until you defeat all foes. However, each individual wagon has its own life bar and if one of your wagons keeps getting damaged it will eventually slow you down. That said, during combat not only you have to keep an eye for that, but you also have to make sure that your train doesn\u2019t get on fire, which is done by sending one of your crew members to put the first signs of fire off before it spreads along the train. Controlling your units during combat is pretty basic, just select the unit and then click where you want it to move or attack. Usually they will attack any enemy on their line of sight, but when there are multiple enemies you might want to issue orders yourself and focus on a single target.<br><br>One thing that actually bothers me is that when you\u2019re ambushed the objective of the enemy always looks like it is to destroy you not rob you of your cargo as you\u2019d might expect. It would be nice if there were different types of combat encounters which forced you to protect your cargo while bandits try to take it away for example. The game offers some degree of challenge not only in terms of combat, but also in the way that you have to carefully plan what missions you will take, which town you\u2019ll visit next, what wagons will you take and things like that. Failing a mission will make you lose reputation with 1 of the 4 factions or with the city you were doing that mission for, and you\u2019ll also have to play a fee.<br><br>Towns play a huge role in the game and as time passes, they will change from one side of the fight to another of the American Civil War conflict and that will affect the prices of various products. In towns you can buy various different goods, which you can sell at other towns for a profit, you can hire new crew members, you can upgrade your train by buying better parts and customize it with different types of wagons (passenger wagons, cargo wagons, etc) while designing your own train the way you want to be, still more wagons will make you go slower and consume more coal so you have to be mindful about it. In towns you can also buy new weapons and sell your old ones, accept quests like getting a certain amount of resources or transporting someone to another city, you can also heal your characters and repair your train but in order to do so you\u2019ll have to wait a few hours (in game). You can also buy turrets for your train and choose different stats for your characters when they level up.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final verdict<\/div><br><b>Overall, despite the fact that it is in Early Access, Bounty Train is lot of fun to play but after playing it for a few hours I feel like it needs more content such as random encounters to vary things up or more towns, just something that extends and adds more variety to the experience. Still, I feel like that the asking price is a bit high for what it offers, at least at the moment, I\u2019d say that you should only grab it right now if you\u2019re one of those people that likes playing the same game over and over which, in a game like this, everytime you play is probably going to be a different experience given the fact that it is not a linear story driven game. Personally I\u2019d recommend waiting for a sale or a price drop.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23544403', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23544403' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23544403\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23544403' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23544403\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23544403', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23544403_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23544403_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17729462\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lb122\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"9907516\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7be8113a5328da72c636e8b0daa5f113bbe1dac8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7be8113a5328da72c636e8b0daa5f113bbe1dac8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7be8113a5328da72c636e8b0daa5f113bbe1dac8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lb122\/\" data-miniprofile=\"9907516\">Lightbringer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lb122\/games\/?tab=all\">231 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lb122\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lb122\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 26, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBounty Train is pretty much a spiritual successor of 1993s game &quot;Transartica&quot;. The idea of a &quot;base on rails&quot;, which you can upgrade and customise is still a novel an interesting idea. The narrative is interesting enough to keep you hooked, but most people will (or will not) enjoy it due to its gameplay. As a European, not very interested in American history, I find this part the most unappealing. However, the game keeps a realistic, non-comical, tone, which makes it easier to take in.<br><br>The announced features are mostly there and working. However, beware that the difficulty in the first hours is still brutal, and the tutorial is insufficient. Additionally, the interface lacks descriptions for many core concepts. Therefore, the learning curve is pretty steep and the game requires a lot of exploration by trial and error at the time of writing. The game is functional and looks polished, but is not very accessible at the moment (not as bad as &quot;Towns&quot; in case you ever played that)<br><br>However, if you like trains and &quot;rouge likes&quot; (ergo some challenge), you'll enjoy this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17729462', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17729462' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17729462\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17729462' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17729462\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17729462', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17729462_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17729462_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23564139\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">EdenStarGazer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/games\/?tab=all\">705 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/\">55 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Bounty Train for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Iron Horse dreams are coming around the bend, in this Civil War era sim from Daedalic Entertainment and Corbie Games. All Aboard for trading, fighting bandits, and building your own train to travel from city to city.<\/div>You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve walked into a mid 1800\u2019s train station with historically accurate firing pieces, and the old Iron Horse engines themselves. This game is still in early access, and much is yet to be rolled out, but much fun is already on the line for those who want to get in early on a price that may not remain past ea. I received this game free for review purposes, in exchange for an honest review, but bought the dlc myself after having a look at all Bounty Train has to offer. <br><br><b>Mechanics:<\/b><br>The game operates much like many of the pirate sims; with a dual view between the map and the train station. When in the map view, you purchase licenses to unlock sections of the track, click on cities you choose to travel to, and deal with bandits, Native Americans, and soldiers who try to relieve you of everything from your cargo, your money, to your life. You may fight, flee, or pay bribe money to dispatch these rascals. <br><br>If you fight, you switch to an actual view of your train on the track, where you may direct your hired hands to discharge the bandits with longarms, pistols, or even explosives. Meanwhile you have to extinguish fires, heal your wounded crew, and protect your train. When your train reaches a town, you have a loading screen into the train station view, and each city has its own unique station, and buildings. You may click on the people standing around the station platform to accept fares for other cities, cargo to carry down the line, or letters, messages, or other missions to carry out for love or money. This requires careful planning, as you have a time limit on delivering from point A to point B. So, choose based on the cities you plan to visit next. Certain aspects couldn\u2019t be deciphered like whether my brother was on board or not. I hadn\u2019t had an empty seat when I met him, then I was unable to complete that mission. This has been addressed in an earlier patch for Sam Archer, though apparently it\u2019s still an issue, just with a different brother, as I had the problem with Robert.<br><br><br><b>Narrative Rich<\/b> <br>Bounty Train has a bountiful story, with immersive missions that will carry you from your inheritance of this train after your Father\u2019s untimely death, all the way to a face to face with Mr. Lincoln himself. If you choose to start with the tutorial, you are given this info in the first town when you return from Europe. You\u2019re instructed to go to the next town to meet with the Lawyer for further instructions. If you skip the tutorial, you begin in the 2nd city with the lawyer. Either way, you take your thousand dollar starting purse, and travel from city to city in search of your siblings, so you can convince them to pool their influence from your combined 55% of the railroad\u2019s stock to convince the company to take the shorter route and spare the Indians in the process of finishing up this train business faster, so you can take the money and run. There is a Sandbox mode in the menu as well, with the time restraints removed to give you unlimited time to complete missions. <br><br><b>Graphics, Music, &amp; DLC:<\/b><br>If you love historically accurate gaming, this sim\u2019s for you. Everything from the design of the people, the trains, and the buildings, to the 19th century Civil War music is history. The card art includes the various engines. The emoticons includes cowboy hats, Indian headdresses, and caps for the Northern and the Southern soldiers. Whichever faction you choose to ally with, you will find yourself immersed in a time that is rich in industrial legend.  The graphics are simple, but pleasing because of the historical feel. And, what can I say? There are all the neat train cars of a forgotten time. <br><br><b>Pros:<\/b> <br>*Historical quality<br>*Trains <br>*Immersive story quest <br>*Fun combat <br>*Day\/Night Cycle<br><br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>*Minor bugs and glitches which are being patched<br>*Incomplete tutorial teaches (fun) aspect of driving train which you rarely use again for some reason<br>*DLC is not released yet, except for the extra engine (but it\u2019s a great one) <br>*Unspecified wait on the art book and sound track, as well <br><br><b>Updates:<\/b> <br>Edited to reflect changes in my understanding\/ representation of Sandbox mode<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Bounty Train is a good railroad\/ trading sim that sits square in the middle of the American Civil War era, and is bound to be a niche favorite for railroad buffs and historical aficionados alike.<\/div> Look for great things to come from this early release game. But, if you are ready and willing to jump into the early access, it already has much to offer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23564139', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23564139' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23564139\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23564139' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23564139\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23564139', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23564139_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23564139_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24414424\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"42302043\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7abbf5bf255ef7bb6de9de89712de3b13df38543.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7abbf5bf255ef7bb6de9de89712de3b13df38543.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7abbf5bf255ef7bb6de9de89712de3b13df38543_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42302043\">Xenus Icelon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/games\/?tab=all\">382 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/recommended\/\">82 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002567771\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't usually review early access(2016-7-19), but for Bounty Train, I figured I may as well<br><br>Bounty Train is a game about running a train through the not-so-wild eastern coast of the USA right in during the civil war, trading in the cities and ferrying small amounts of passengers around. It has several ways to make money, and plenty more ways to lose it. But in the end every part of it works great on its own, but is still not really working together as a single whole game just yet.<br><br>You can trade, you can customise your train with carriages and historical locomotives, you can do combat when the bandits try to take your money, you can level up, and you can have a chase scene almost straight from a western. It is already entertaining and a pleasant experience, with the base gameplay being solid and simple enough to understand even for someone new to the game. At the same time it allows you enough control to remain interesting after you learn the basics.<br><br>The graphics and sound are pleasant, with the world map being a well made stylised view. That is where my first complaint lies. Specifically, with the transition between your train view to the world map. Every single time you do this you get a loading screen, which slows down the game by a lot as anyone who doesn't know US geography will need to go check the world map every time they see a place name to see where it is, and even those who do know will need to check it regularly to see if there is an indian camp or army position at the track they plan to take. This is quite harsh on the flow of the game, especially if you need to switch back and forth multiple time before actually moving your train.<br><br>Other negatives are balance issues. As it is early access, I'm not weighing them as much since they are mainly numbers that need tweaking, or things in need of more explaining. For example, the ability to escape from bandits is fun to have, with the chase being interesting and very good at engaging you as you have to control your train. But what it doesn't say is that you have only old trains, and you are not going to go fast enough to escape from anything at all unless you've left most of your wagons at the station. Any train that has enough cargo to make a profit is better off just stopping and shooting the bandits until they stop coming, simply because of the weight of your cargo slowing you down enough to make escape impossible. <br>At a similar note, often you do not get a chance to escape at all. When the army engages you(Which they will, both north and south will en up hating you for no particular reason other than you existing) you are only given the option to attack them, with no way to escape until time on their barricade runs out. The barricade they have lasts long enough for them to completely destroy your train before you can move on, which will feel like the game just said &quot;Okay, you encounter this event. You lose&quot;, rather than it being your fault for your loss until the late game where you can defend against a small army group.<br><br>Another balance issue is the weaponry, some of them are just plain better than others, and when the bandits attacking you have these stronger guns and you don't, you do not have a good chance. What is worse is that you can not loot their weaponry; Loot is randomly generated after combat is already over.<br><br>While Bounty Train has a lot of potential, it is still unfinished as the Early Access tag says. Even then it is certainly worth keeping an eye on for when they tweak the gameplay and finish adding the rest of it. The price is a bit steep for what is in it at this point, but there is a promise for more, and if you are sceptical about that then there will be a sale for it at some point.\t\t\t\t\t<div

fun, and watching your train grow to be something powerful and unstoppable, from a train likely to break down going too fast on the wrong corner, is just fantastic.<br><br>great game, as it is updated more I'm sure it will be even better, thanks corbie developers for your help<br><br><br><br>OLD REVIEW<br>G\u0336a\u0336m\u0336e\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336

Battles are tatical rpgs.  This is a base builder, with your base being a train.  Your time spent mostly consists of taking good jobs and escorting as many folks as possible so it requires a lot of strategy and management.  It can be a bit difficult, this will probably be balanced out.   I've spent a lot of time  and money paying off folks so they don't kill me because it is too costly to put down any bad guy you come across.

Therefore I feel like I must change my review and admit that i was wrong, which I am glad because this game has so muchpotential. I have always liked this game and think it has a ton of potential. I put it down and I awlays come back to it. Every aspect of the games is well done and it is more polished then a lot of games that are not in early access. If this game had turned based combat I don't think I would ever put it down, but turned based with moving trains probably would not work that well. The devs are very involved in making this game great and are engaged with the community, I would say buy this game now!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29309421', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29309421' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29309421\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29309421' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29309421\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29309421', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29309421_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29309421_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29253801\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bigzinewicz\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"103976510\">Gunznbuttaz<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat concept for a game plus I love trains. If you like trains and the old west then give it a try I know I'm happy I did. Haven't got too far into it yet so my review might change but figured I would throw a positive up for the time being as it is a great idea for a game and is fun to play as well as being interesting and challenging. Price is a little high but if developers keep putting in new content it should be worth it in the end. The game itself is a combination of different genres and systems to create a kind of blended smoothie of PC gaming goodness. It is worth it too educate yourself and read some curator reviews on the game maybe watch a few Youtube videos and give it a shot.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29253801', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29253801' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29253801\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29253801' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29253801\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29253801', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29253801_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29253801_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29042522\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wozmir\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"11076158\">wozmir<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 16.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMy first review. Why? Because I've really enjoyed this game. While many important aspects still need some flourish - gunfights, chases, trade NOT being the only viable way to play - Bounty Train is a nice trade\/wild west\/train game. And, correct me if I'm wrong, the only game of its kind? <br><br>The devs are working on it and delivering solid incremental updates. It's not FTL + trains but, honestly, I haven't seen any game claiming to be FTL + something to truly deliver. Well, MAYBE Convoy. Maybe!<br><br>If you like trains, wild west and light economic gameplay - buy it now. If not, wait for sale, but get it anyway :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29042522', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29042522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29042522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29042522' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29042522\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29042522', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29042522_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29042522_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29029221\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197988387615\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"28121887\">Venusgate<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 27.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but probably the main reason I'm into this game is it's surprising difficulty.

I give this about a 8 out of 10. <br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28716940', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28716940' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28716940\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28716940' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28716940\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28716940', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28716940_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28716940_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28615831\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198040518872\/recommended\/371520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"80253144\">Geohff<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 33.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Bounty Train was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEnjoyed this game very much when I got it. Just got around to getting the hang of it and was going to write a review with some minor grips, but still recommend it. <br><br>Then the update dropped and whoo hoo its awsome! Accounted for all my grips with added risk of events blocking certain areas of track, smuggling expanded to make much more sense and be allowed more within a nation, ability to adjust amount of bandit \/ indian attacks and how hard they are (big up on this one), all new quest goals, (so much better!), reputation having meaning, quest in general so much better, all new mail system, all new way to pick up passengers which makes the whole process easer and makes more sense, encounters which you run your train that are not combat! And so much more. Little things like miles of your loco and cars decides chance of breaking down, prices and quantity of goods can change if you dont have a newspaper subscription they really put thought and effort into emmersion, (well except Santa which I hope is just a Christmas gimmick).<br><br>On the down side, only one thing, and im not even sure this is intended but now I must micro manage my operator, have to actually keep clicking on coal to get him to feed the box. If I get distracted the train stops then takes a while to be fed and start rolling again. I think the operator knows how to feed coal himself without being told. But like I said it may be me missing a new mechanic. I did discover the joy of understanding speed limits and how not to damage your train however while messing with him so there is that ;)<br><br>Overall its a buy, and now on sale - go for it if you were on the fence before wait no longer it well worth it now!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28615831', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28615831' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28615831\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28615831' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28615831\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28615831', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28615831_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28615831_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/371520\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 300 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["23184887","17718132","23601884","17725701","28085858","17921125","23544403","17729462","23564139","24414424"]}
