I would really suggest you try the demo. If you do enjoy it, the rest of the game is more of the same. The graphics aren't mind blowing, but I find them to be really charming, and it kind of feels like a throwback. The gameplay is very basic and straight forward, kill things to get exp and gear to make your numbers bigger, so you can kill bigger things and get more bigger numbers to fight even more bigger things.The quests are basic kill\/fetch quests and it's basically a grindfest. The English in the game isn't perfect and will make you crindge if you're a grammar nazi or intolerant of poor English.<br><br>By pretty much all standards this game is bad. It's got the addictiveness of a clicker in that you are basically doing nothing, but seeing your numbers get bigger is fun; The narrative is weak (if there is one, feels like every quest is just side missions), all items are just &quot;whites&quot;, your next chest piece will have more armor, and your next sword more damage, but that is all they're good for and there is no visual difference; sections of the game are poorly balanced and frustrating (around level 13 you have to go through a room of level 2 spiders, but there are so many that if they get off a volley of venom you get one shot unless you're drastically over geared, boss that spawns adds continued to spawn adds after death, etc.); spells feel uninspired, and so far seem to be featuring &quot;enchanted&quot; melee attacks and various bolts (fire bolt\/lightning bolt\/etc.); and lots of interface issues (you can't hotkey potions, all of the interfaces such as your bag, character screen, etc. can only be closed by clicking the X and can only be opened by physically clicking on them).<br><br>Despite all this I just find the game damn charming and nostalgic. I'm not sure if that is what the developer was going for, but it truly feels like something I would have been playing as a kid about 15-16 years ago and has the same sort of issues as games of that time. Definitely not a game for everyone, but if a pointless grindfest sound like fun, you like clicker-esque games that are just all about getting bigger numbers, or you just want to remember how far games have come... Try the demo, it's a good representation of the whole.<br><br>TLDR: The game is bad, but bad in a way that I think it has an audience. Ultimately, if you think this might appeal to you play the demo. Don't even finish it. If you don't like the game in the first 5 minutes, you're not going to like it.<br><br>The Bad: Rehashes age old bad design decisions, bugs, imbalance, uninspired combat\\loot, interface, grindfest, graphics, poor English, Comic Sans.<br><br>The Good: Rehashes age old bad design decisions, bugs, imbalance, uninspired combat\\loot, interface, grindfest, graphics, poor English, Comic Sans.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29640586', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29640586' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29640586\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29640586' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29640586\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29640586', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29640586_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29640586_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/579330\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29640586"]}
