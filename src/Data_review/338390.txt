Party companions are good, you can combine them in different situations or use their special abilities. Character development is well done - for instance in skill tree you can choose your style and combine many abilities\/passives to your preference. Quick minimap overlay is a great help. Some quests however are tedious because you need to go from place to place with constantly respawning enemies which in the end you will just avoid to fight. What's the point in that you ask? - that question seems to be never asked when developing\/testing which is a shame :\/<br><br><b><u>Story:<\/u> 4\/5<\/b><br>It was engaging with some twists, nothing extraordinary. Companions have their own stories in form of side quests where you can find out more about them and they will reward you with some of their abilities which further improve your party\/character. As a developer Spiders did improve their writing to build up lore &amp; atmosphere and present meaningful themes.<br><br><b><u>Combat:<\/u> 2\/5<\/b><br>You can choose from three styles, I choose technomancer\/warrior style. Pretty much if you played The Witcher 2 you know about that secret combat style which is kinda famous in that game - that is to constantly make rolls and dodge during any combat event. Here it's the same sequence most of the time:<br><i>Attack, dodge, attack, dodge, spam aoe\/skill, dodge, use health, dodge, end of fight.<\/i><br><br>I've managed to beat it at the highest 'extreme' difficulty and I'm not a pro player. It can be difficult at first but you need to use that secret technique above and you are in 98% just fine, mind the RNG when approaching enemies =)<br><br>There are some boss fights mainly with creatures that present more challenge, but only in that aspect you will need to learn their attack sequence and where they are vulnerable. Swap you equipment to boost resistances etc.<br><br><b><u>Visual:<\/u> 3\/5<\/b><br>So this was really a mixed bag. Sometimes it looks really good and in other cases it just pretty much disappoint. Good point is that for what it offers it isn't demanding. I liked the unique environments and that you will be traveling between them, only negative there isn't enough of them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">EDIT: Ohh totally forgot about MUSIC!

The consequences of the events that take place in that game do have consequences in Technomancer's story though. (Mostly for the mutants)<br><br>Anyone that is interested in this game should know that this isn't a AAA title, but if you can deal with its shortcomings due to its budget, you'll see that its a remarkable game made by a relatively small studio.<br>Now if you're still interested after having read all that check out my review below! ;)<br><br>Positives<br><br>+ If you do every single quest you can easily get 30 hours out of this game, its an ok length in my opinion. <br>I was sad when it ended though.<br>+ Great soundtrack by Olivier Deriviere, just like in his previous work he doesn't disappoint!<br>+ Amazing story in which your decisions have real, serious consequences later on. If you take your time listening to the dialog and learning more about the world you'll find that it's quite interesting and engaging.<br>+ Flexible skill tree, everyone can easily make their unique character with their own fighting style.<br>+ Beautiful graphics, some of the environments are very well done and I recommend everyone to have a look around once in a while to take it all in.<br>+ Each companion has their own backstory and &quot;loyalty missions&quot; if you take your time getting to know them they won't disappoint.<br>+ Crafting system that allows you to upgrade your gear, changing its visual look as well.<br>+ You can equip your companions, giving them new weapons and armor. If you do it right you can make them quite strong.<br>+ Lots of side quests that tie in nicely with the main story and overall atmosphere of the game.<br>+ There are different factions in the game that you can ally with, watch out though if you do things they dislike you can become their enemy as well.<br>+ Good combat system that makes you think each time you enter a battle, mashing a few buttons and hoping you'll get through it alright is a good way to die MANY times. Use traps, well timed dodging\/parrying and use your powers wisely.<br>+ Different endings that depend on the choices you've made throughout the story.<br>+ You can romance a few of your companions as well if you play your cards right ;)<br>+ Deep lore (players of Mars War Logs know what I'm talking about)<br><br>And now I must sadly point out the negatives...<br><br>- Voice acting is a mixed bag (I thought it was ok but some people will think its awful)<br>- Characters have almost no emotion when it comes to their facial expressions, you see subtle changes but don't expect anything amazing...<br>- Framerate issues, there are some drops when you run around in certain areas.<br>- A few glitches and bugs here and there but nothing major or game breaking.<br>- Combat can be very frustrating  at times, I'm a calm and patient person but if you check some of the posts on the discussion board you can easily find people raging about the combat.<br>No it isn't bad, you need to think before you act and take some time familiarizing yourself with the combat system.<br>AND. USE. TRAPS! They can save your life when you're having trouble in a big battle, just be sure to jump out of the way before it blows up in your face XD<br>- There are a few quests that make you backtrack quite a bit.<br><br><br>Conclusion<br><br>It's definitely not for everyone, I'd recommend people to play Mars War Logs first.<br>If you like it and love the lore and world in that game you'll love this one (its the same universe)<br>This game is much better than Mars War Logs of course they've clearly learned quite a bit from their previous mistakes.<br>The core systems remain pretty much the same though, they've just been improved and expanded upon them quite a bit.<br>Try out Mars War Logs, its pretty cheap now and if you don't like it you can always get a refund ;)<br>If you don't like that game you probably won't like this one either so its a good way to dip your toe in this franchise.<br><br>I give this game an 8\/10<br><br>Despite its flaws I absolutely loved the story and characters presented here, after you leave the starting area the story gets going and I got hooked. <br>Finished it in one go, couldn't bring myself to stop.<br>I really wanted to see how the story would end and I must say it didn't disappoint me.<br>There's a pretty big plot twist at the end that I loved as well...<br><br><br>Keep it up devs! I hope this isn't the last time we get to visit Mars!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27188468', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27188468' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27188468\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27188468' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27188468\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27188468', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27188468_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27188468_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t294 of 344 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25022612\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">183.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Technomancer takes place in the relatively distant future, 200 years after humanity has colonized Mars. Players take on the role of Zachariah Mancer, a member of the technomancer order on Mars. As a technomancer, Zachariah is a mutant who can control the destructive elemental power of electricity. Early on in the game, Zachariah ends up on the run from one of the most powerful corporations on Mars, and puts together a ragtag team of individuals who will help him shape the fate of Mars.<br><br>A strong premise and original concept can hold a game together, even when its chips and cracks begin to pull it apart. Thrown into a futuristic steampunk world, this action RPG maintains its delivery of a cutthroat tone of desperation and survival on a war-torn Mars. You will explore the awesome powers of technomancy, crafting for you and your revolving party, and countless quests achieving the robust feeling every RPG seeks. Regrettably, it all feels squandered into a game experience that lacks fluidity, responsive controls, and the general modern elements of today\u2019s RPGs.<br><br>The Technomancer will feel familiar to many players, and well, the elephant in the room is that it draws a lot of very obvious inspiration from Bioware RPGs. Everything from the companion system to the soundtrack bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain popular sci-fi RPG. And unfortunately, The Technomancer feels like a rather low-budget version of the Bioware formula, having more in common with Mass Effect 1 than Mass Effect 3. By mimicking Bioware\u2019s model, The Technomancer casts a light on its own shortcomings when it doesn\u2019t meet the standards players might expect from that kind of game, and it often does fall short.<br><br>That said, The Technomancer certainly sets itself apart from the titles that influenced it, which is most apparent in the world that has been built for the player. The world of The Technomancer is foreign, unique, and genuinely interesting to explore. Little details, like every character\u2019s last name defaulting to their job\/role\/status in society creep up on the player as they experience the world, and it\u2019s everything that a fan of open-RPGs could hope for. <br><br>Unfortunately, the world is not introduced to the player particularly well, mostly due to the game\u2019s poor writing. The opening monologue introduces the player to about fifteen different concepts over the span of thirty seconds, and amounts to nonsense, only coming together hours later. Similarly, various political factions, societal norms, and unusual qualities of the world are rarely introduced to the player in an organized fashion, but rather are left to the player to figure it out at some point.<br><br>There\u2019s one element in The Technomancer\u2019s gameplay that I think developer Spiders explored deeper than other RPGs, and it really lent it its identity. The Karma System. It\u2019s been toyed with before, but I\u2019ve rarely seen it have such significance as it does here. In The Technomancer the currency is known as Serum. Now you can either get it as a reward for completing missions, loot from enemies, or killing for it. You will find that if you kill too many people for their serum, disobey orders, or any other wrongdoings, your party and other NPCs will actually dislike you. They will begin to back talk, ignore your commands, and even desert your party all together. I thought this was pretty neat how much your karma can actually shift your story and experience.<br><br>The Technomancer\u2019s third person action comes with three different play types for combat. You can play as a Rogue, which equips Zachariah with a one handed weapon and a gun. A guardian, which is a one handed weapon and a shield. Then finally the Warrior, this gives Zachariah a long staff. What\u2019s pretty cool is that you can switch between these stances on the fly, allowing diversity and personal preference to the action.<br><br>Being a Technomancer means no matter what play type you select, you will also be able to cast electrical power attacks as well, and charge your weapons with a glorious lighting bolt coating for an extra buff. There\u2019s a lot of options within each fight scenario. Along the way you will see an array of new weapons to swap and upgrade for each stance, preventing any sort of stagnant feeling with your gear. The one handed weapons range from cleavers, to hammers, axes, and swords. Guns go from nailguns, to assault rifles, high precision pistols, and more. That\u2019s just naming a few, there are also numerous types of shields and staffs that you can keep buffing Zachariah with too. Nothing should feel more badass than a cleaver surging with electricity in one hand, and an iron spiked shield in the other.<br><br>While the gameplay isn't buggy, depending on how you play it can be quite difficult. Each stance is a bit different, and you'll figure out which one you like pretty quickly, but even then you'll probably end up replaying chunks of missions that include combat until you've decided which stance works best for you.<br><br>Like most RPGs, completing quests and defeating enemies grants experience to the player. There are many different ways to level and develop Zachariah. There are three different systems in which to do this. First is the Skills, which are broken up into Technomaner, Warrior, Rouge, and Gaurdian categories. Adding points to each enhance your abilities and unlock new ones. Second is the Talents section. This is where you level various things like charisma for dialogue, lock picking, science for better health regeneration, and crafting. Lastly you have the Attributes, which are broken into four sections of strength, power, agility, and constitution. Every time you level you won\u2019t unlock new points for each category, so it\u2019s important you choose wisely.<br><br>So you will notice a crazy amount of loot opportunities in The Technomancer. They do become redundant as you pick up a lot of the same materials, but that\u2019s okay because crafting will utilize all of it. The crafting system is extremely easy to use which is very welcomed when working with so much inventory. Select items, whether its gear or weapons, will have open slots. In these slots you can craft additions to the piece with physical damage reduction, critical hit enhancements, increased attack, and more. When you craft, the visual appearance of the gear will actually change too depending on what you add to it. What\u2019s even better is you can share all of your weapons and gear with your party.<br><br>The Technomancer may take place in the future, but the graphics look very much from the past. Bland textures occupy every environment. Character models are missing real expression and appear so generic. A saving grace is the lighting effects. The Technomancer\u2019s electric powers and weapons look great. They glow a bright soft blue and even cast shadows on the players, but that is the only standout visual perk. The presentation otherwise just looks low budget and dated.<br><br>There is a lot of dialogue to dissect in The Technomancer, and that\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not fine is the awful, empty voice performance of Zachariah. I mean it\u2019s like old school Resident Evil bad. No matter the gravity and emotion of any scenario, I would immediately become deadened to it as soon as Zachariah spoke. That's a shame because most of the other voice work is actually decent.<br><br>All in all The Technomancer is a fun adventure, which will definitely grow on you. It\u2019s from the school of RPGs which are engrossing despite their laundry list of flaws. There\u2019s much to be said for a small team like Spiders chipping away at a hideously involving and expensive genre, and for that they should be congratulated. It doesn\u2019t have the polish of a Mass Effect 3 or Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but The Technomancer sure has a lot of heart.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25022612', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25022612' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25022612\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25022612' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25022612\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25022612', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25022612_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25022612_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t311 of 387 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23941031\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"39878928\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bc87bcd36dd12e1f7cf3e8985a3b6c7a069232.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bc87bcd36dd12e1f7cf3e8985a3b6c7a069232.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bc87bcd36dd12e1f7cf3e8985a3b6c7a069232_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/\" data-miniprofile=\"39878928\">[KR]Silvio Rodriguez<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/games\/?tab=all\">280 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/recommended\/\">14 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurix3m\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">29.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI usually wait until I finish games before I write reviews for them. <br>But the weird negativity from some of the earlier reviews made me wanna do it already. <br>Otherwise people will look at the steam page and think that it might not be worth it. <br><br>It is worth it, the game might feel slow and a bit lacking at start, but that is because the start acts as an<br>tutorial, you'll get to learn how to fight, how interaction with different characters are, what the world is about and<br>how it is all managed. Most negative reviews haven't left this stage. <br><br>I have played about 10 hours right now if I recall correctly, and I have just left the first area. The amount of content in this area is great, there are many side-quests, interesting side quests where you get to interact more with the common people, whos lifes you otherwise would not be able to follow at all. <br><br>The thing with The Technomancer is that outside of quests and important people the world is a bit dead, there are people there yes, walking around, standing in groups and sometimes you do hear them talk about something interesting, but you can't intearct with anyone, except if they have a quest for you. <br><br>The main quest is also forming up, but this far I've had more interesting events with the side quests, this might change later in the game.<br><br>Another thing that become greater later in the game is your squad. At the start of the game you get two generic squad members, probably to ger you more understood with how the squad system works. Because these guys are quite dull to be honest. But belive me, more interesting people will join up with you as time flies, and you'll have to plan on who to take with you. <br><br>The combat was also something that bugged me at the start, or not really. It bugged me before start, I had looked into some gameplay and the fighting looked really stiff, but it flows quite nicely while fighting, though the camera angle annoys me atleast once per fight. Someone wrote that fights grow repetitive, well that might be the case if you use the same abilities and weapons over and over and over again. There are huge variation in how you want to fight, it takes some time to get good though, and master it is an art. The variety of enemies you fight is great as well, everything from humans to Mars monsters! <br><br>I've also read a lot of negativity towards the voice actors, and I don't know if it's because I'm not an native English speaker but I think it sounds fine. Sometimes the face animations doesn't match the tone of the voice, but that is probably more because of the face animations. The animations though.... They are not too pretty, they work out as intended, but some of them are a bit quirky. <br><br>When it comes to sound and music it's really good and matches the world circling it. <br><br>But overall again, the game has many flaws but to be honest, quite unimportant flaws when it comes to it. <br>They are visible, they stick out, but it doesn't drag the game down. The gameplay is still fun, the story is still interesting. And I haven't even written about the level system yet, or the crafting system. Both which are very good and well detailed. And the loot! Don't forget about the loot! <br><br>I think this is a great game to play if you are awaiting the next Mass Effect game, it sorta gives me the same vibes those games gave me. But beware, it's not an AAA game. It will not by far feel as polished as any of the ME games. But the fun factor remains! <br><br>Well, I hope this helps you! &lt;3\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23941031', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23941031' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23941031\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23941031' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23941031\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23941031', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23941031_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23941031_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t165 of 197 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29367378\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"14990242\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/\" data-miniprofile=\"14990242\">jcfra420<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/games\/?tab=all\">20 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fscproductions\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">71.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI wanted to take some time for this review. Especially after reading the review on IGN, because I honestly think that is an injustice. Technomancer is a great, in depth RPG. Placed on Mars you are a type of military agent called a Technomancer. You control electicity. You can either shoot it, add it to your weapon or use it as a shield.<br><br>There are 3 types of fighting you can chose from. Mace\/Shield (tank), gun\/dagger (rogue) or a staff (fighting caster). The story is intriguing, and the characters are engaging. The voice acting is top knotch, besides a couple that are really not good.<br><br>If you like the Witcher 3 type combat style you will like this game. What I like most of all, it is challenging. So save often, because you can die at any fight if your not careful. This is not a &quot;I am god&quot; game, it takes skill, and in an age of carebare games, I like that.<br><br>I enjoyed this game so much, I got its predecessor (Mars War Logs). Though the combat is a little more clunky in that one, it was still also a great engaging game, and really set up the story for my second playthrough of Technomancer. I will be writing a review on the previous game as well.<br><br>This is from a small, relatively unknown studio, but the game is so well done. Do yourself a favor, and try it out. To me it was a definate 5 STAR game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29367378', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29367378' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29367378\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29367378' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29367378\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29367378', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29367378_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29367378_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t214 of 272 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23979125\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"111110357\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/8189a763ba56b300611bfafe47d93e2ba2853558.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/8189a763ba56b300611bfafe47d93e2ba2853558.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/8189a763ba56b300611bfafe47d93e2ba2853558_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/\" data-miniprofile=\"111110357\">Cure Optimism<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/games\/?tab=all\">341 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CureOptimism\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">41.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHaving played for 7 hours and feeling as though I've only scratched the surface, these are my brief &quot;first impressions&quot; so to speak.<br><br>This is, without a doubt, the best RPG Spiders has made so far. The main grievances with the first game in the series, Mars: War Logs, have been addressed. The voice acting is improved ten-fold, the maps are much, much larger and more varied, there are a mutlitude of ways to complete objectives depending on your character build, (Diplomacy, brute-froce, stealth, intimidation) an impressive amount of armour and weapon customization even by triple-A standards, 4 skill trees with tons of perks and abilities to level up. The first cty hub area is larger in size and scope than any in Mass Effect 2, a game with quadruple the budget. This is the definition of a sequel done absolutely right. <br><br>The combat is quite a challenge and takes practice to get a hold of. You'll get your \u2665\u2665\u2665 handed to you if you button mash. don't read your opponent's movements and don't properly use staggering attacks, traps, spells, dodges, sweeps, ripostes and ranged weapons accordingly. This is apparent in IGN's utter embarrassment of a review where they lambasterd the game for being too difficult amongst other things.<br><br>The universe and lore they have created is preposterously deep and well-realized with a lot of backstory and flavour to really immerse yourself in this world. The story itself seems far more interesting and important than Roy in Mars: War Logs trying to break out of prison and accidentally getting involved in some revolution. The main character, Zach, is somewhat of a clean slate for the player to assume, but he is in no way a static brick. If you don't write your character as a sarcastic chucklehead or a tortured father it's considered bland these days. <br><br>One thing you need to realize is that this is a middle-market game, something that hardly exists anymore. You either have giant Battlefield\/Assassin's Creed games with a thousand people working on it over multiple studios, or 16-bit retro games made by some guy and maybe a couple of his friends in his basement. This is somewhere inbetween that.  It doesn't have a giant publisher backing it, and its devs are people with champagne tastes on a beer budget. The fact that they have created something that, while not polished to a mirror sheen, manages to excel in places much more popular games fail is a testament to the competence and passion of the developers and I can't recommend it highly enough.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23979125', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23979125' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23979125\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23979125' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23979125\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23979125', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23979125_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23979125_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30898442\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaszman1\/recommended\/338390\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"23198952\">Dial-Up Ninja<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIts not a AAA rpg if you looking at the graphics, voice acting, animations etc. but still charming and a tons of fun. Dont expect a Mass Effect killer or a KOTOR spiritual successor from this small company. <br><br>The creators put a lots of love in this game. The world is fresh and original, the combat is fun and the character development is better than most role playng games systems today. There are some interesting characters and a beautiful level design in my opinion.

The combat system does not stand out either and it tends to be a bit too hard in the beginning.<br><br>But I still can't bring myself to give the game a completely negative review because you get the feeling that the developers of the game did but a lot of hard work into it. The game has a story that is overall quite good. Most characters are really interesting, even thou some are somewhat non-dynamic.

I like to think of my game buys with the $1 for every 1 hr of gameplay and I played 4x what I paid. Worth it. 10\/10 would buy and play again.<br><br><br>Full Review:<br><br>I'm still not sure how this game has a mixed review. The only thing I can think of is that people were expecting a third-person version of Skrim. And it's not. And never pretends to be. THe closest game I can compare this to is Bound by Flame (which I also fully enjoyed). This is a game about the story. Sure it's pretty standard and is told through the normal ways, but, again, it never thought to do anything but that.<br><br>The story is told well, and, though ending up predictible, is a joyful ride to get to. Sure, you know right after the first mission that this is going to go bad for you eventually, but you can choose how bad it gets.<br><br>My only gripe with this game is the fetch missions and the lack of weapons. I very much dislike having to go from city to city for a small side quest that grants me 500 experience. Even more than that, I disliked having to finish a &quot;chapter&quot; to unlocked new weapons and upgrades for them. Certain RPG elements stop after so many points are spent in them and you can progress no further. The only thing that continues (yet according to the game says you can move no further) is your level and skills.<br><br>The most enjoyable part for me, was I played this game on Hard with one save file. I never saved and loaded a save that might end up in a better end game situation. I died a lot and loaded back 1-2 hours of game play from forgetting to save, but ended up making the same choices as the first time. I was commited, and I did not want to turn back. <br><br>Overall.... 8\/10 - RPG elements could have been better as well as weapons, but I enjoyed every moment I played. I like to think of my game buys with the $1 for every 1 hr of gameplay and I played 4x what I paid.
