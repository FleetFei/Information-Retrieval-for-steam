Taken at face value, it's a duel between wizards capable of summoning dangerous creatures and unleashing mighty spells of destruction. Now that description could apply to any number of games but there are three elements that make this one special.<br><br>If Sid Meier once described games as a series of interesting decisions, Chaos Reborn's gameplay could be described as a series of calculated gambles because the random number generator plays a pivotal role in casting and combat. Experienced players frequently describe the game's strategy in terms of risk-management: minimising risk to yourself while forcing your opponent into taking risky actions. Yeah, you could definitely seize the initiative by summoning a majestic Sapphire Dragon on your first turn but a lowly Dwarf would be a safer bet.<br><br>There will naturally be moments when your gambles don't pay off and even 90% spells fail. Here's the second element that makes Chaos Reborn engaging: tactical improvisation. You don't win duels with the spells in your deck; you win duels with the spells you actually cast. The biggest mistake new players make is anticipating only successful outcomes for risky actions. You'll frequently see wizards rushing towards their opponents aggressively, waving their staves dramatically in the air and then completely embarrassing themselves with a failed cast. This is hugely entertaining when it happens to your opponents; not so much when it happens to you. Hope for success; plan for failure.<br><br>However, there will also be moments when you absolutely need a creature regardless of the risk involved. Perhaps you need a Hellhound to petrify an advancing Giant. Perhaps you need a Giant Spider to ensnare a rampant Vampire. Here then is the third element that makes Chaos Reborn special: bluffing. Bluffing in this game is accomplished with illusions and they are often the key to victory. Instead of taking the risk of summoning a real creature, players may opt to cast an illusory version of it. Casting an illusion is guaranteed to succeed and illusory creatures function exactly as their real counterparts would but illusions are not without their own risks. If a sceptical opponent chooses to disbelieve an illusion, it immediately disappears so if your entire game plan revolves around one key falsehood, the consequences of being caught out can be far-reaching and disastrous.<br><br>Using illusions effectively is the most difficult skill in the game to master but the payoff  is huge. The best Chaos Reborn players can leave their opponents frustrated, flummoxed and uttering other f-words by fooling them into disbelieving real creatures and convincing them illusions are real. <br><br>In other games, you merely defeat your opponents.<br><br>In Chaos Reborn, you leave your opponents questioning reality.<br><br><b>Recommended for:<\/b> players who love Blood Bowl matches and X-COM battles.<br><br><b>Not recommended for:<\/b> players who are convinced 90% means guaranteed and 10% means impossible.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19301664', 'summary' );

I found it was the perfect game for taking a break from work. I would start a game, cast some spells, kill some creatures and basically have fun. Whether I won or lost I would go back to work feeling refreshed. The best thing for me was that every game was different, since you had to adapt your strategy to the spells you got, rather than designing a strategy and then picking the spells to implement it. So, after playing Chaos for 30 years, you'll understand that I was a tad excited when I heard that Julian Gollop was planning to work on a Chaos reboot, so to speak, to be called Chaos Reborn.<br><br>I've been a backer since day one and I've been having great fun watching the game grow, playing the early prototypes and exchanging ideas with other people (including Julian Gollop himself) in the Chaos Reborn forum. Instead of saying &quot;Here's a new version of the prototype, see you next time&quot;, Julian says &quot;Here's a new version. What do you think? Does this work? What about this? How can we make the game better?&quot;. I truly feel that Julian values everyone's input, and the improvements made in each version of the prototype reflect just that. Some things are added, others are removed, and the game gets better and better with every new version.<br><br>What is the game about, then? Well, each player controls a wizard and your goal is to be the last wizard standing. Each turn you can move your wizard, attack other creatures and - most importantly - cast spells. Spells include creatures, magical attacks, magical equipment (like swords and shields) and other fantastic stuff like Shadow Trees and Gooey Blob. In every turn there are decisions to make. Shall you risk having your wizard in the front on keep him or her in the rear, while letting your creatures fend for themselves? Shall you use your mana to boost the casting chance of spells or shall you save it in order to try getting your mega spell? Shall you take the initiative or hold back in the corner and trust that the other wizards will be kind enough to kill each other while you watch and wait for the perfect moment to strike?<br><br>Another great thing is that you whenever you cast a creature you have the option of making it real or an illusion. Real creatures are subject to casting chances, with stronger creatures like dragons and hydras being quite difficult to cast. Conversely, illusions work every time, but they can be destroyed instantly with the disbelieve spell. This adds a bluffing element to the game. Each time you see an enemy creature you wonder if it's real or an illusion, but the only way to find out is either by killing it or by casting disbelieve, and if it turns out that the creature is real then you will have wasted your chance to cast a spell for that turn and may find yourself wishing you hadn't. Only a Chaos and\/or Chaos Reborn player knows the feeling of giving everything you've got in order to kill a creature, only to see it blow up in smoke and to realise that it was an illusion all along and that you could have simply disbelieved it.<br><br>By the way, since the first Chaos Reborn prototype came out I haven't playing the original Chaos again. As things stand, I have played Chaos for 30 years and I truly believe that I will be playing Chaos Reborn for the next 30. Kudos to Julian Gollop and his team for making an early access game so immensely fun to play.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13296735', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13296735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13296735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13296735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13296735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13296735', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13296735_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13296735_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t138 of 155 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">8 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18730088\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"36157508\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/420bea29ea57fe5186ca00e2d76f816e4d60f465.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/420bea29ea57fe5186ca00e2d76f816e4d60f465.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/420bea29ea57fe5186ca00e2d76f816e4d60f465_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/\" data-miniprofile=\"36157508\">stubar<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/games\/?tab=all\">2,210 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/recommended\/\">80 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stubar\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">807.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tChaos Reborn is a rework of a game created in 1985, so thirty years ago!!  The original game was written on the ZX Spectrum and called &quot;Chaos: The Battle of Wizards&quot;.  It was developed by Julian Gollop who was also the creator of the original x-com which most people are familiar with.  I used to play the original &quot;Chaos&quot; game way back then in the eighties, so when I heard the news that the same developer was going to be working on the remake I was extremely excited!!  <br><br>It plays like a conventional table-top game with dice rolls.  The game is played between two, three or four wizards that have a random number of spells at their disposal which are distributed at the start of the game, similar to a card deck.  The spells consist of creature summons, buffs, environment spells and magic-attacks.<br><br>The map is hex-based so looks a little similar to other turn-based strategy games but we have many differences in Chaos Reborn.  For starters there is no hit-point system.  A successful attack on one of your army means it will die.  The calculation takes into account the attack vs defence so you can still use your summons with high defence to block and tank but there is a chance that it could be defeated with a lucky shot.  <br><br>Every action in the game has a percentage chance of success.  These chances can be influenced via a number of factors including mana, elevation, buffs, law\/chaos alignment.  Spells are either aligned with Law, Chaos or are Neutral.  The more Law spells cast successfully, the more the world changes to become Law attuned and future Law spells will be given a buff to the spell casting chance, the same is true for Chaos aligned spells.  This means that a 20% success spell can, in the right circumstance get buffed all the way up to 100% casting chance!  So influencing these factors and casting at the right times can be a crucial part of your winning strategy.<br><br>Another important mechanic is the ability to cast 100% successfully when summoning a creature by means of opting for an illusion.  The illusion will function exactly the same as a real creature with the exception that your opponent can call your bluff.  They may cast a \u201cDisbelieve\u201d spell and if successful the creature will vanish and your opponent will get another casting turn.  If the creature is real then your opponent won\u2019t get another chance to cast a spell until their following turn.<br><br>Your turn consists of moving and casting a spell, but you are completely free to move any creature in any order during your turn and you can also choose to cast at any point.  This opens up the tactics and makes it a lot less restrictive than most TBS games that have turn and movement phases.  Considering line-of sights and moving, positioning and casting in the most efficient order can be the difference between victory and defeat!<br><br>Games can be played live with a timer with options of between one and three minutes per turn.  Alternatively you can play up to twenty asynchronous games which can be played over a number of days or even weeks, taking your turn at your leisure.  If you find yourself enjoying the game you can enter into one of the many community leagues or tournaments organised outside of the main game.<br><br>During the early-access I posted regular screenshots to my steam feed and the most popular comments was how nice the game looked.  It really is eye candy and there are so many nice touches such as the backgrounds and lighting subtly changing colours depending on whether the world is law or chaos aligned.<br><br>The development team \u201cSnapshot\u201d continue to develop this game past its full release and we are expecting new features to be added such as new spells, in-game social features and more.<br><br>There really is no other game similar to Chaos Reborn with its eclectic mixture of gaming elements.  I\u2019ve tried to describe the core game as best as I can to give you the clearest picture of what this game is.  If it even remotely sounds like your type of thing then I can highly recommend this purchase.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18730088', 'summary' );

The learning curve upon starting the game doesn't seem as steep as I expected and players used to this genre of game will most likely feel right at home. You are prompted to start with offline single player battles to learn the game and I would recommend this. For your first battle you are given popups which prompt and help you learn different aspects of the game. <br>\n<br>\nAt the start of each battle your character is given randomly a set of spells (some of which you have access to and others which are held in reserve) and a staff which favours a certain type of spell and contains a special powerful mega-spell which requires a number of mana gems to use. The players\/AI then take turns to move their characters\/summoned creatures around the battle arena, attack and cast a spell. You can also throw away spells which earn you mana gems and another random spell card from your remaining stack (be careful you can run out!). <br>\n<br>\nEach spell has a chance to work, these chances depend on how powerful the spell is and also on the balance of Chaos \/ Law spells that have already been cast. More Law spells being cast successfully make it easier for other wizards to cast Law spells, I found this very powerful and a really interesting feature. You can also increase the chances of a spell working with mana gems, but you need to be careful which spells to apply gems to and which ones to just gamble with. There is a good range of spells and the balance of power seems good overall, but the random nature of the spell draw coupled with the possible failure of spells can force your strategy. <br>\n<br>\nSummoned creatures have a set of stats (how good they are at attacking \/ defending \/ etc) and a large range of abilities to explore. You also have the ability to summon an illusionary version of your creature which removes the failure chance but leaves it susceptible to a spell called Disbelieve which will cause your creature to disappear (this can give a great advantage if you are able to bluff your opponents).<br>\n<br>\nTo win you need to kill the other players or have the most killpoints (earned by killing opponents summoned creatures) when the turn timer runs out. The AI is good but of course the real challenge is battling against other players in multiplayer mode. The old adage &quot;easy to learn and difficult to master&quot; feels very appropriate for this game, but even when losing its a lot of fun to play.<\/td>  <\/tr>  <tr>    <td>Replayability<\/td>    <td>8<\/td>    <td>Chaos reborn has great replayability, the random nature of the spell draw, Law\/Chaos Balance, placement within the battle arena and other conditions means you have a huge range of possible scenarios that you will need to deal with. There is no one winning strategy its a combination of dynamic strategy - adapting to and making the best to your current position, knowledge of your spells\/creature abilities, skill and a bit of luck. <\/td>  <\/tr>  <tr>    <td><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall<\/div><\/td>    <td>8<\/td>    <td>Chaos Reborn as it stands is a great game, fun in single player mode, challenging in mulitplayer and with some fantastic features being introduced that i'm really looking forward to (like the coop RPG mode).<\/td>  <\/tr><\/table>*** This review was made with a review key ***<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fancy_fish\/recommended\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >More reviews by Fancy Fish<\/a><br><i>Agree \/ Disagree?

So here is a new one, reviewing the game as of V1.10, released today!<br><br>Chaos Reborn is a hex based, turn based, card based strategy game where you are a wizard and you have to kill the other wizards. This is done by casting spells which can either summon creatures to attack other creatures and wizards, cast magic attack spells to kill almost anything, or create growth spells that hinders mobility. You'll soon learn that different creatures have different strengths and weaknesses, far too many to list here but you'll learn them.<br><br>You have a choice of what kind of game you want to play - if you love managing risk and playing with lots of RNG, there is Chaos Mode. This is the mode that was not only the only way to play the original, but was the only mode when the game was in development, so it has a strong following from many of the core players. It's also my favourite. Basically, every spell has a % chance of being cast, and there are many factors that can affect what that % is going to be. Stronger spells have a lower chance of being cast than the weaker ones. Killing creatures also has % chance, based again on many factors but the main one being attack + defence of the creatures in combat. <br><br>In v1.8, a new mode was introduced called Law Mode. Law Mode is a more standard affair, a lot of the RNG is stripped away for players who are not comfortable with playing with a lot of RNG. So, instead of % chance of being cast, spells have a mana cost to being cast. The more powerful ones are more expensive than the less powerful ones. Combat is also very different - everything now has Health Points, and the amount of damage dealt is influenced by attack + defence of the creatures in combat. <br><br>In amongst Law and Chaos Mode, you have two ways of playing (so much choice!) - Classic or Equipped. Classic gives all wizards the same bodygear and staff with equal stats for a truly level playing field. Equipped mode however gives you the chance to be creative, allows for customisation and creates far more exciting games - you get staffs and bodygears that have special features and particular alignments to certain spells, and so allows you to customise your wizard based on your play style. <br><br><br>But wait, there's more! There is an Offline Mode where you can play offline games and a single player campaign. There are also some tutorials. Use these to familiarise yourself with the game first before jumping into Multiplayer.<br><br>Multiplayer offers up to 4 different ways of playing - PvP Matchmaker (Friendlies and Ranked), PvP Private Games with your mates, Online Realms (with ally and invading options, where you can help your friends or fight them), and the all new Duels mode - jump into a 1v1 match to win Forge crystals so you can build your own staffs and bodygear.<br><br>But wait, there is EVEN MORE. There are social ranks - so at the end of each month, if you've met certain criteria, you level up to a new rank. Apprentice is your base rank - which goes up to Lord, where you can offer yourself up as a Lord defender for a King and his realm - which goes up to King, where you can make your own Realm, and then up to Demi God and God, which I understand that in the future, you can create guilds and tournaments, but no details on this as of yet, which has disappointed some, certainly those who participated in the Kickstarter, but hasn't bothered most (at least, that is the impression I get).<br><br>So is the game any good? In a word, yes absolutely. It looks gorgeous, it sounds good - it's easy to play but difficult to master. Lots of stats to learn, lots of spells to choose from, great community, and above all a lot of fun. I highly recommend Chaos Mode as that is the most exciting, but if you don't like its outcome dependancy on RNG, there is Law mode that may be more to your taste. <br><br>However, the game does suffer from minor balance issues here and there. Also, the tutorials don't do a fantastic job in selling the game as well as it could. Plus, personally, I think the offline campaign is boring as hell. However, Julian and the Snapshot team do their best to address the most serious issues with regular updates, which now and again come with new features. And yes, there are still issues.<br><br>But overall, yes I sing the praises much of this game, but 900+ hours and still enjoying it everytime I login, I have much to praise. Great game, highly recommended.<br><br>24\/11\/2016 - I put Chaos Reborn forward for the custom category &quot;The RNGesus&quot; Award.

The developers though, to their credit, showed a laudible willingness to accomodate popular demand, and added new mechanics to the game that balanced things out, which (IMO), have vastly improved the strategic depth of combat and the overall experience of the game.<br><br>Since the changes were implimented, I have sunk many hours into both PvE and PvP, and my opinion on this game has completely reversed. Collecting gear, customizing builds, and exploring player made worlds (which I eagerly look forward to trying out, myself) is actually loads of fun, now that I am no longer frustrated with the irritating luck-based mechanics that drove me away the first time.<br><br>And the icing on the cake, is: they preserved the old mechanics under an optional game mode so that players who actually *preferred* the old version can still play it that way, if they wish. All-in-all, these decisions show a general willingness by the developers to accomodate players that I find very reassuring, and encouraging.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25476831', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25476831' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25476831\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25476831' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25476831\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25476831', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25476831_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25476831_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23346641\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/baldrlux\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"49461068\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a0ec58ccb03e88ed2f5679c4a46e7ef2d78be1bd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a0ec58ccb03e88ed2f5679c4a46e7ef2d78be1bd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a0ec58ccb03e88ed2f5679c4a46e7ef2d78be1bd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/baldrlux\/\" data-miniprofile=\"49461068\">NoWorries<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/baldrlux\/games\/?tab=all\">481 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/baldrlux\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/baldrlux\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1,345.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>TL;DR:<\/b> I enjoy this game immensely. This review summarizes some reasons why.<br><br><b>THE THEME:<\/b> At the end of the 14th century, Earth shattered into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflict over who controls the many, surviving realms of old Earth. Each realm holds the promise of ancient artifacts, lore, and power to fuel the ambitions of wizards and gods alike. It is a feudal, dystopic society of magic users.<br><br><b>THE DEVELOPER:<\/b> <i>Chaos Reborn<\/i> is a rebirth and reimagining of <i>Chaos: The Battle of Wizards<\/i> (1985) and <i>Lords of Chaos<\/i> (1990) by their original creator, Julian Gollop. Mr. Gollop is more known for creating the original <i>X-COM: UFO Defense<\/i> (1994), the widely acclaimed classic which inspired <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown<\/i> and many other games. The classic <i>Chaos<\/i> and <i>X-COM<\/i> games were rooted upon deep, tactical play. <i>Chaos Reborn<\/i> is a true successor to both legacies.<br><br><b>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY:<\/b> I cannot really do the basic gameplay experience justice in a short paragraph. It has too many tactical layers. But at essence, the game involves duels of up to 6 wizards. Wizards can invoke flamboyantly magical spells and summon creatures. Yet wizards themselves are fragile and must be protected. Imagine a three dimensional, multi-layered game of wizard chess with variable numbers and types of pieces which can come and go, and where each attack has a very real chance of failure. But if you lose the wizard, then you lose the game. Sometimes you will lose despite your best efforts, and sometimes you will win because you were lucky rather than good. That said, this game is tactically deep and, over time, rewards players who come to understand and appreciate all of the many, varied tactical approaches to gameplay.<br><br><b>TUTORIAL:<\/b> There is a tutorial labeled \u201cWizard Training\u201d in the main menu. It comprises a series of gated set-piece encounters which gradually introduce you to the fundamental mechanics and tactics of the game. Having played the game for hundreds of hours before experiencing the tutorial, I still found it enjoyable. It\u2019s not often that I can say that about a tutorial.<br><br><b>ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES:<\/b> Multiplayer wizard duels can be played live or asynchronously with up to 6 players. Matches can be friendly or ranked. And matches can be played Equipped (with custom equipment) or Classic (with standard equipment). Ranked matches allow you to qualify as an &quot;Archmage&quot; at which point you will be given your worldwide rank computed by an ELO scoring method. League standings reset in monthly seasons. Whether friendly or ranked, matches generally go quickly. As for the asynchronous games, these are my favorites. You can have up to 20 asynchronous games going at any time. Each player has many days to complete their turns in a match, but I find matches generally go more quickly than that. After ranked matches were first introduced, I completed 35 ranked async matches in just 3 days, and this was gameplay I managed in bits of free time that I had rather in continuous sittings. (I love, love the asynchronous functionality.) Additionally, players can create custom friendly matches, changing the parameters of the game. <br><br><b>ONLINE SINGLEPLAYER:<\/b> There are developer and player created Realms of Chaos which you can explore online with your wizard. These Realms vary in size and challenge and come with a rating system to help determine which are worth exploring. The essential aspect of this game mode is to explore the map to find and defeat all of the Wizard Lords (AI-controlled mini-bosses) in order to reach and defeat the Wizard King (AI-controlled boss) of the Realm. While you are doing this, the Wizard King and his Wizard Lords summon reinforcements. And if you take too long, the Wizard King can banish you from the Realm. This game mode should not be considered a full-fledged RPG. Think of each of the Realms as puzzles to be solved, and some have stories to tell. <br><br><b>CO-OP:<\/b> The game creates an internal friends list based upon your Steam friends list. You can also add game-only friends. With these friends, you can invite them to co-op with you in online Realms or in online custom games with up to 6 wizards.<br><br><b>OFFLINE HOTSEAT AND SINGLEPLAYER GAME MODES:<\/b> There are offline game modes which allow hotseat gameplay against any combination of human or AI-controlled opponents. There is an offline singleplayer campaign. I have not played much of the singleplayer campaign. I find the online Realms experience superior as it integrates with all of the other online features.<br><br><b>GRAPHICS:<\/b> The game uses the Unity game engine, which should be compatible with most computers. The custom art and animations are quite pretty. And the game really does have its own, unique graphical theme. Don\u2019t rely on me for too much input on this, as I was playing the game when wizards and creatures were represented by crude, unanimated placeholder graphics. But if you really care about graphics, the graphics are good.<br><br><b>IN SUM:<\/b> As-is, the game is a gem. If you like tactical turn-based games, then spending $20 on <i>Chaos Reborn<\/i> will get you one of the more fun games in your Steam inventory. If you\u2019ve read this far and the game still intrigues you, then you should get the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23346641', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23346641' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23346641\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23346641' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23346641\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23346641', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23346641_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23346641_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16366878\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"33209152\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a58c0aadb78b2a026d353b2f37712a4070255c3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a58c0aadb78b2a026d353b2f37712a4070255c3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a58c0aadb78b2a026d353b2f37712a4070255c3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33209152\">What's Up Doge<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/games\/?tab=all\">73 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dodostek\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Chaos Reborn was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'Charged across grasslands on top of my illusory unicorn, chased by an undead giant, for ten minutes before plopping a magic bolt into my opponent's face.'<br><br>If we compare Chaos: Reborn to other games it is a mixture of Chess, Poker and trading card games.

Should you attack your opponent in melee for a 71% chance to win the game on the spot, or will opening yourself up to counterattack actually decrease your overall win chances?<br>- Epic balance shifts. One cast or one attack can totally shift the balance of battle. Succeeding on a 30% cast for a giant Hydra will give your opponent headaches, but not as much as him killing the Hydra with a puny rat (3% kill chance).<br>- Mindgames. You always have to question your enemy. Was he really lucky on that cast, or is he bluffing you with illusions to circumvent the fail chance? <br><br>The state of the current game is solid, with over 40 different spells of which 15-30 are randomly added to your 'deck' every game. Every game is different, from 2 minute stomps to 30 minute back-and-forths with numerous monsters fighting it out. <br><br>The community is VERY FRIENDLY. There is a lot of banter during games, which the game itself inspires because every game is a short and epic story. Matchmaking is rudimentary but functioning and there is a dedicated tournament website + chat room to support the social aspect.<br><br>The only current drawback I see is the size of the player base. At the peak times it's very easy to find a match, but during European work hours it can be impossible because there's next to nobody online. Another reason for you to buy the game and come join us.<br><br>Buy this game if you want a laid-back, slow paced game that is both clowny and deeply tactical at the same time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16366878', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16366878' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16366878\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16366878' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16366878\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16366878', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16366878_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16366878_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23257088\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030755224\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"70489496\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51c1696a5652412917f566bdaf93154a7de8d77e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51c1696a5652412917f566bdaf93154a7de8d77e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51c1696a5652412917f566bdaf93154a7de8d77e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030755224\/\" data-miniprofile=\"70489496\">NeoWave Interleave<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030755224\/games\/?tab=all\">45 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030755224\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030755224\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">850.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tChaos Reborn is a fun tactical \u2018board\u2019 game in which you can either manage risks in order to get what you want in Chaos Mode or use more traditional rts tactics and spend mana in Law Mode. <br><br>Basically in Chaos Mode you have to manage an RNG using verious tools when attacking or casting spells. Equipment, height, cosmic balance and spending mana can all tip the odds in your favour. In Law Mode creatures &amp; wizards have hitpoints and attack causes damage to them whilst you cast spells by spending mana with Equipment giving advantages in combat &amp; spell casting. Both modes have merit and are fun to play &amp; you can select the best one to suit your style of play.<br><br>The graphics are great, the creatures are varied and many have special abilities that add to the strategic elements along with the various bits of equipment you can pick up along the way. All this means battles are varied, gripping, and anyone who leans some basic tactics can win.<br><br>As for the gameplay itself, there are a number of modes to keep you occupied whether it be friendlies, league matches, or jumping into the more RPG based Realms. You can create Custom battles to fight your online friends, or call them for help in a Realm battle. <br><br>So, to conclude, Chaos Reborn really does have something for a lot of gamers and I highly recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23257088', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23257088' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23257088\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23257088' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23257088\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23257088', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23257088_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23257088_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t58 of 73 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18676361\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"44751866\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fbd8e3876ae5be223cbe6a243854abdf1261b85a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fbd8e3876ae5be223cbe6a243854abdf1261b85a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fbd8e3876ae5be223cbe6a243854abdf1261b85a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/\" data-miniprofile=\"44751866\">Zephyrio<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/games\/?tab=all\">24 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005017594\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">357.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tChaos Reborn is a great turn-based strategy game where wizards try to kill each other by summoning creatures and using other spells! Every action has only a certain probability of success and, therefore, you need to manage the risks vs the rewards at every step. <br>To master the game, you always need to find out what your best move is. Do you try to summon an eagle with success rate 80 % or do you summon an illusion, which always works but might get disbelieved by your opponent? Do you use your precious mana points to boost the probability of some spell or do you save it for the mega spell? Do you move forward and try to kill your opponent with a magic bolt, leaving you open to a possible counter attacks when you miss?<br><br>Matches can be played in live mode (2 mins per turn, 3 mins in unranked) or in asynchronous mode (2 days per turn). A typical (2-player) live-match lasts about 10-30 minutes, while asynchronous matches allow you to play the game even when you don't have a lot of time, because you can login to do your moves whenever you have time.<br>Furthermore, you can choose to play matches in equipment mode (where you choose your equipment before the match) or in classic mode (all players have standard equipment).<br><br>For single player, there are the realms of chaos available, where you fight against the AI. These realms can be created by other players and, thus, are going to be very different, increasing the replayability. It is possible to find some additional equipment (like staffs or bodygears) in these realms, but is is also possible to obtain additional equipment by using gold (which is acquired by playing matches).<br><br>I highly recommend this game for everyone who likes strategy games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18676361', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18676361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18676361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18676361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18676361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18676361', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18676361_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18676361_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30101519\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mbchrono\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"185325\">MBchrono<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 28.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFantastic game.

Then it sets you loose.  My first endeavor was to try online duels.  It pitted me against bots at first due to low online players.  It went well, but i began to notice things that I liked and disliked about the game.  I like lists so I'm going to do just that:<br>I LIKED: <br> - Competetive league play options with ranks and rewards.<br> - Customizable equipment that allow you to tinker with your playstyle<br> - In-game currency, no micro transactions, booster pack purchase system (armor, staves, and talismans)<br> - In-depth, dynamic field-of-play combat system where the cards played affect costs and strengths of other cards for both players.<br>I DONT LIKE:<br> - Randomized deck generation. I can gear my equipment towards one type of card all I want, but theres the potential that I get less of those types of cards during one game than another.  Each game you play gives you different cards to play with so you can attempt to build a strategy, but unless its a vague generic strategy or several &quot;in-case&quot; strategies you have on reserve, you just can't depend on it. I could see this being a problem for high stakes Ranked League matches...  Luck of the draw...<br> - Progression system for wizards doesnt seem very fulfilling.  The ability to customize your gear early on gives you pretty much just as much customization as a wizard at any other level.  The only difference is that they have had the opportunity to purchase MANY more randomized talismans than you and have had more experience with all the cards.  Besides that, I could easily see a 1st level starter wizard giving a &quot;maxed&quot; out wizard a run for their money, and I struggle with that.<br> - Randomized booster pack purchases ONLY.  I like that you have the option to purchase booster packs, but ONLY random packs??  SO if I just have terrible luck for weeks and someone else happens to get exactly what they want... it sucks to suck?<br>A part of me wants to buckle down and try to dig into this game to see how tactical I can get and really refine my playstyle, but then another part of me knows that no matter how much I try to get my game down solid, I could get ruined by a random generator when it matters most...

I admit I did have to milk the Tutorials and some of the campain in the free trial before I decided to pick it up, why? Its strange, but it grows on you. <br><br>If you like chess like game play, with high fantasy you ought to find this enjoyable, a bit odd, but enjoyable, Multiplayer campains(where you get better equipment that you can keep) can have other players ruin your day...if you allow them in, otherwise you can play against A.I in custom maps to get the resources you need to feel comftrable with a particular play style... or just not bother playing with other people at all, your choice<br><br>A mechanic I found very intresting was how the matches can &quot;shift&quot; to either Law(featuring elves, paladans,etc) or Choas(undead...mostly) in which cards of the associated faction will cost less and the opposing faction more...which creates an intresting dynamic late game(sometimes putting you in a rough spot if your not paying attension), and if you dont want to be affected by THOSE what so ever, there are also natural cards...which dont care about the balance and feature animals like lions<br><br>Overall I like it, its a diffrent flavour then I am used to(Loving Hero Chronicals I was exicted by the hexogonal grid) but I do BINGE play this every so often...then leave it alone until I suddenly have that craving I didn't know I had till Choas Reborn came in...<br><br>I admit, its a little strange, and they could do a better job with matchmaking...but thats probably a work in progress, intresting ideas though, imagine you just going into someone else's campain for a match, and you can actually add to their expereince, and similarly someone could pop in to a battle your fighting in your campain to make things a lot more intresting, also you can mount certain creatures like Minitours and Peagasi that add some protection and mobility to your spell castor which moves around the map<br><br>I probably could go on, but...to sum up, If your unsure(like I was) pick up the free trial and learn the mechanics that I think are rather neat, the animation is awesome and fits a craving for a little bit of Heros of Might and Magic or Magic the Gathering without all the fuss of creating a deck or building and managing an economy(other then your own purse obviously) <br><br>Now excuse me...I think I might have a craving coming in....\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29736769', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29736769' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29736769\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29736769' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29736769\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29736769', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29736769_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29736769_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29332084\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030940597\/recommended\/319050\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"70674869\">alexei.andreev<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 38.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(This review contains no story spoilers, and mostly covers my impression of the game and its mechanics.)<br><br><b>TL;DR:<\/b> Wow, this is an amazing game. Really fun dueling mechanics, including some bluffing elements; fun strategies to test; various play-modes to explore; well developed multiplayer.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overview<\/div><br>You play as a wizard. Most of the time you spend dueling other wizards. You have a deck of cards. The deck is randomly generated from all the cards in the game, but biased towards your wizard's strengths (fighting vs wizarding; order vs chaos vs neutral). You draw some cards from the deck and that's your hand. You cast the spells you have in your hand. You can cast the spell for real, paying the mana cost fully, or you can cast the illusion version of the spell, paying no mana, but risking that your opponent might figure it out and dispel you creature for basically free (hence a very fun element of bluffing).<br><br>During the duel, you and the monsters you summon are on a hex-grid. You can move around, taking turns with your opponent, to navigate you wizard and your creatures into a better position. The map has various features that impact the strategy: height, holes, mana sources. You win when you kill the opposing wizard.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Order and chaos modes<\/div><br>I'm not sure how it came to be, but this game basically has two pretty distinct fighting game-modes: order and chaos. In order, you use your mana to cast spells, and everything (e.g. damage) is done predictably. A spell costs X mana, a creature will do Y damage. It's pretty intuitive and easy to pick up.<br>In chaos mode, everything is left up to chance: whether or not your spell cast will succeed, whether an attack will hit, etc... A spell will succeed with X probability; a creature will kill with Y probability. This leads to very different gameplays, since you have to account for the possibility for many of your spells failing.<br>At first I was shocked that they went through the effort of making both of these, but I think each works nicely, and it adds an interesting dimension to the game. Order is a good place to start, but I'm guessing that at higher expert levels the game really shines in chaos mode.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Map mode<\/div><br>I'm not totally sure why, but there is a very simplified &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;-type map mode where you travel around a map and attack various key buildings. You can recruit units to travel with you and help you fight. This makes sense for the campaign-mode, but it's also pushed pretty heavily in multiplayer. One interesting mechanic is that when someone is playing on a map like that and starts a duel with an AI wizard, you can jump in and become that wizard, thus making it way harder for the other person. (You earn some gold, crystals, and XP if you win.)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Offline and multiplayer mode<\/div><br>There is an offline mode where you can go through a campaign. I got pretty tired of it pretty fast. The story and writing are kind of dry, plus at some point it becomes a bit tedious to fight AI.<br><br>The multiplayer mode is where it's at. You start by creating your level 1 wizard hero. There is a healthy amount of customization you can do, which will impact your dueling strategy.<br><br>Other stuff you do in multiplayer:<br>* You can duel other players. If you win, you get gold, minerals, and XP.<br>* You can go to various &quot;realms&quot; (see Map mode) and get items and gold that way, but it feels a bit tedious.<br>* You can spend gold on getting items for your wizard, which will add various improvements to your spells.<br>* You can spend minerals to forge your own custom items. This seems really cool, though I haven't played with it too much yet.<br>* Once you get high enough level in multiplayer, you can apparently craft your own maps. I haven't got that far yet.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Some takeaways<\/div><br>The good:<br>* Very fun dueling mechanics. Especially love the illusion \/ bluff mechanic.<br>* Good amount of fun spells (around 50 total) with various strategies one could pursue.<br>* Love the art and the aesthetic of the game.<br>* When playing against higher level human opponents, you can still do very well. I almost defeated a level 100+ player as a level 9 (and have beat multiple times people with levels 30+).<br>* Looks like there is still an active community around the game. I haven't had trouble finding matches. Everyone was very friendly.<br><br>The meh:<br>* Map mode (and therefore most of single player campaign).<br>* Normally matches take about 1-20 minutes, which seems totally fine to me; but something about the pacing of the game still feels slow.<br><br>The bad...?

Traits such as the turn-based hex grid combat were what I wanted, but I found much more to this game than that. This game is very complex in its combat systems, the Law \/ Chaos combat modes make the gameplay of combat much more challenging than the straight-forward slug fest of the previously mention games.<br>     Chaos Reborn also has a different and more challenging feature in combat, Illusions which can make you both guess about the ability of the computer to summons minions and pay attention to the card costs and do math. Overall the game has proven much more challenging in combat with a very polished finish when it comes to the smooth graphics and animations. <br>     Looking for a game thats combat makes you think and plan what the enemy is capable of in the familiar aspects of a turn based hex grid strategy game, if so this game is for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28898437', 'recent_short' );
