(Articial Intelligence)<\/u> - I cannot emphasis or stress enough of how extremely good the A.I. is. It's probably one of the most advanced one I've seen in a 4x game genre. I absolutely love how it handles playing against me and handling my orders for planets, colonization, and etc (without the need to micromanage everything). Again, the A.I. in this game is just so good that it cannot be expressed sufficiently of how good it is. Even the developer of this game admits that hard is very tough for him. <br><br><\/li><li><u> Automating<\/u> - This relates to the A.I. but one significant difference. I love the fact that I can explore the galaxy and leave behind orders to colonize it and what kind of focus I would want on the colony. I checked on their build orders and made sure it fit. I have to say that I don't think I can do it any better than the A.I. except on my core worlds, which I micro-manage personally as it's the engine to my war machines. :) With this ability, I was able to colonize very efficiently and quickly without having to waste hours on fine-tuning it. <br><br><\/li><li><u> Resource Management\/Economy<\/u> - I absolutely love the fact that credits were completely eliminated and it only boils down to about 8 resources needed (I think I counted right). What's really nice about this is that you know which kind of planets you need to get specific type of resources. Some resources are very rare but for a good reason as they are access to very powerful technologies. Along with resource management, they are used as upkeep for your fleets as well. I think the developer has done an excellent job in balancing the resource consumption vs resource generation that every decision you make really counts. <br><br>The other thing to note is population. The way the developer has set it up is to make the population really count. This reminds me of the game Imperium Galactica II, where population was something to watch as you would put them to work. The same concept works here. You can build something (don't have to worry about placing it) then have the population grow to work on it. There is a limit of how many buildings you can place and it shows you in the planetary screen. The A.I. does a beautiful job in helping you to get the population necessary to work in the buildings you want. Again, this relates to grand strategy. <br><br><\/li><li><u> Science &amp; Technologies<\/u> - I'm used to a linear path for technologies. However, this is an extremely refreshing take on gaining technologies. Instead of just building labs and generating more points to research faster to obtain technologies faster, the developer took an different approach, which I truly think mirrors how this world works. You have two path, which is fundamental and applied . Fundmental allows you to open up other branches of science to gain more exotic technologies (I.E. Antimatter). Applied gives you the actual technologies to use. It makes a lot of sense and I love it. You can control the direction of how you want your research to go by setting priorities, which speeds up your ability to obtain the specific technologies you want. <br><br>I think this approach is far better for an 4x game. <br> <br><\/li><li><u> Customization <\/u>- The ability to customize your ship is fairly common but for this specific game, they added something that I immensely enjoyed, multiple layers of the ships. If I wanted to create an spy ship, I'll use a freighter that has three layers to it. Oh, the options I could have is immense, especially when you get all the technologies. I like the fact that you have to be decisive on what kind of ship you want and you have to make sacrifices to decide what that ship will specialize in. You can't have one ship that does everything. You actually need different ship designs for specific role. I think the developer has nailed this perfectly. <br><\/li><li><u> Random Events <\/u>- I have to say when I was playing on normal, I really had to slug it out with the pirates at the beginning of the game. The pirates would take advantage of you and if they got you in a position of weakness, they'd open an dialogue and ask you for 10% payment of resources &quot;to protect you&quot; and stop their attacks. It was a really cool thing to see that. However, it didn't just stop there but there were external threats that really shook up the game and it took every ounce of my abilities to beat it back (this was just on normal!!). However, it was rewarding to finally defeat it although I admit that that the ending was a little anti-climatic but the fight to get there was epic. <br><br>To put it in perspective, I had over 350 planets colonized and only four of them were my major shipyards. The external threat took out three of them and I only had one ship yard building my massive warships but it takes about 18 years per warship. I was forced to retool some of my planets to industralization to try to produce more warship, which caused problems with food resources and among others. It made me sweat but this is the kind of game that has me playing for 10 hours straight, just trying to beat it back. <br><br>Good job on keep me on my toes, even late game isn't a guaranteed that you'll win. <br><br><\/li><li><u> Tactical Combat <\/u>- In my humble opinion, I think this game has took what Master of Orion 2 had and improved on it. The amount of control that we have in tactical combat is unbelievable and the A.I. kicks butt in helping you to manage it. I love the fact that I can control time (speeding it up or slowing it down). Even if I made the speed too high and didn't pause it in time, the A.I. does it for you and puts it in slow-motion so you can still have time to issue orders. Absolutely one of the best feature I've seen. <br><br>Even better, I can quickly sort out my ships and put them in groups then control them based on that or select all fights or capital ships. The developer has made it really easy for you to manage your fleets in tactical combat. <\/li><\/ol><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u>Con: :<\/u><\/div> <ol><li><u> Diplomacy <\/u> - To the developer's credit, the diplomacy is actually pretty good for a game like this. I was actually impressed with the options available for dialogue. You can convince the AI to enter in treaties with you, such as economic, scientific, open borders, and etc.<br><br>However, what frustrated me was that I was unable to ascertain how benetifical these treaties were to me. For example, I get an economic treaty but I have no indication of how much this helps me in my resources or such. I tried hovering over the treaty to get a tooltip information but nothing. I checked in my resources to see if it shows up as additional or not but I couldn't see a difference. I canceled it then recorded the number then re-instated the treaty and the numbers didn't change after 10 years. It was the same for scientific treaties, I couldn't ascertain the benefit either. <br><br>Even more frustrating was the inability to see what causes their attitudes to change. I had one A.I. that had negative attitude all the way but no reason why. I couldn't tell and I tried tooltips and etc, nothing. <br><br><\/li><li><u> Graphic <\/u>- To be fair, it's pretty good for a one-developer show but I like aesthestic but I don't give it my full weight in negative. <\/li><\/ol><br>After playing three games, one on easy then two on normal. I'm too afraid to try hard yet because the AI is incredibly good, even on normal. Easy, it was a little work but easy. I don't think I've seen a game where the AI in every aspect is excellent. To put it bluntly, this is probably one of the best 4x game I've played in an extremely long time. <br><br>When I was playing this, I was reminded of the game Sins of the Solar Empire because it dealt in resources (also credit but not in this game). I really liked how the game focused on allowing you to employ your grand strategies while enjoying some tactical combat. <br><br>Overall, I highly, highly, highly recommend this game for your 4x game fix. :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22010293', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22010293' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22010293\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22010293' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22010293\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22010293', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22010293_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22010293_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t148 of 183 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21985925\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"53292819\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fafdf7da05a7be750d0ab900c886e0a0570703e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fafdf7da05a7be750d0ab900c886e0a0570703e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9f\/9fafdf7da05a7be750d0ab900c886e0a0570703e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/\" data-miniprofile=\"53292819\">rogue_LOVE<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/games\/?tab=all\">185 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rogue_LOVE\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">128.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExcerpted from the full at <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/explorminate.net\/2016\/03\/22\/polaris-sector-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >eXplorminate.<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Rating<\/div><b><u>Recommended<\/u><\/b><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Summary<\/div>Polaris Sector takes the best parts of the space 4X formula and gives them a few fresh, delightful twists.

This game offers several unique things that keep me coming back  to it:<br><br>+ Importance of long-term planning: In most 4x games if you run low on a resource you can just shift population around to fix things quickly. Not so here. You need to carefully plan out your economy, planetary governor focuses, and so much more. The level of in-depth empire management this game offers is only matched by Distant Worlds in my opinion which is a good thing.<br><br>+ Research: Finally a unique approach to research split between developing general fields of research areas that generate specific technologies over time. It takes a little getting used to, but overall it is nice to have something different from the standard tech trees most other 4x games offer.<br><br>+ Combat (specifically fighters): Finally a game where I can design and build proper carriers with swarms of fighters and bombers to use in combat to overwhelm my enemies. Point defense systems can shred fighters though, so a constant balance is needed. This is a game where you can study an enemy's ship designs and build counters to those designs which is always nice to see.<br><br>+ Strong AI: I've seen the AI expand agressively when appropriate and seek friendly relations when I am in a position of stength. AI can be a weak point for many 4x games, but so far I've happen pleasantly satisified with my computer opponents thus far.<br><br>- Exploration: The dev tried to add in some interesting things like anamolies and wormholes to help make the galaxy feel more interesting, but most systems will feel very bland as you search the galaxy. The lack of unique things like minor races and chained events\/quests makes exploration a little dull, but then again that is to be expected in a game of this scale with so many systems to explore.<br><br>Overall this is an easy recommendation from me. The dev is very active and responsive and they deserve credit for the great game they've put together. If you are a 4x fan who enjoys empire management on a large scale this game is for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22069198', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22069198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22069198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22069198' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22069198\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22069198', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22069198_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22069198_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t101 of 135 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21984823\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"31910237\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"31910237\">CommissarBRO<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/games\/?tab=all\">1,093 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/\">158 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is good. I've spent a lot of time playing it over the past few months (beta testing and all that) and I'm glad to see it has finally been released. I provide 2 versions of reviews, a first impressions video version and a written version. A little something for both camps. <br><br>Gameplay Footage:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r-mk3TXp3Vk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r-mk3TXp3Vk<\/a><br><br>So let's get right down to business. What is Polaris Sector? Polaris Sector is a 4x Real-time Grand Strategy game in the same vein as Distant World: Universe or a real time version of Space Empires or even Endless Space. It features a real-time battle system where you command ships and fighters against pirates and all manner of Xenos Scum. There are 9 races which all feature unique ship types and can be customized via point distribution in over 13 passive buffs. As is usual with these sorts of games, you have research (an exhaustingly extensive research tree might I add), exploration, espionage and ship customization. You can also rename planets and systems. It's your standard run of the mill 4x Space game.<br><br>What sets it a part from other games of the same vein?<br>Not much to be honest but it does something very well that a lot of 4x Space Strategy games forget... it feels streamlined and the gameplay is relatively fast paced. You always have something to do but because you can just pause the game or slow the speed to a crawl, you never feel overwhelmed. What's better, is a lot of the processes can be automated like planet colonization, invasion planning or just building up your planets so the game doesn't become overly tedious. You've also got about 6 resources that you have to manage. While that may seem like a lot for this type of game, it's surprisingly not. It's fun trying to find planets that produce the resources you need and meeting production. For a one man project, this game feels INSANELY well done. <br><br>What's wrong with the game?<br>Not much. The game itself is pretty fine tuned. There are few things that bother me with this game like the overpowered fighters. It doesn't seem to matter how technologically advanced your ships are, fighters are practically impossible to beat in large numbers. Seriously, just field a fleet with about 10-20 carriers and build 200 fights with heavy ion guns and I guarantee there is nothing that can stop you. I'd recommend bringing down the power of fighters considerably as they are just a cheap tactic at this stage in the game. <br>The game can also feel a bit tedious later on. For example, in the later stages of the game, it can become a bit tedious having to colonize everything or invading large empires (but remember you can automate that process so that's just me being too lazy to automate it). <br><br>In summation, this is a solid 4x Real-Time Space Strategy game that I've really enjoyed my time with. The streamlined and relatively fast pace at which the game flows means I happily spend dozens of hours glued to the screen managing my little Space Empire. I highly recommend this one for fans of the 4x genre.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21984823', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21984823' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21984823\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21984823' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21984823\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21984823', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21984823_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21984823_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t87 of 114 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21999381\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71079066\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71079066\">Icemania<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/games\/?tab=all\">28 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI had the fortune to play the Beta before release and have been pleasantly surprised after initially being unaware of the game.

If you are too aggressive too early an invasion will often falter and you have to think about what you are building against the AI and how to best deploy them in combat. <br><br>2. The game is well balanced and avoids out of control exploitation. For example, you can't build early game unbeatable doom fleets, you don't find huge amounts of weapons late game that are worthless and so on.<br><br>3. The colony governors are really good. I don\u2019t feel the need to excessively micromanage colonies which vastly reduces the tedium mid to late game. In fact the game shines mid to late for various reasons including the ability to significantly speed up the game.<br><br>4. There is a surprising amount of content for a new release. The game includes an end game threat that had me starting at the screen with my mouth open in shock (noting that I consider the Shakturi in Distant Worlds to be total wimps), a novel ship based espionage system and a good ship design system where component selection matters in-game.<br><br>5. There are some really cool Spiral galaxy maps to play which can make the game really interesting strategically. For example you might start in an outer ring and find yourself blocked by other races from accessing inner rings or the core without using star tunnels and tankers to provide enough range for early to mid-game fleets.<br><br>6. During the beta I have had no crashes at all and just a couple of bugs which the developer promptly responded to. <br><br>Some cautions to consider:<br><br>1. It\u2019s primarily a war game and although there is some variety in the domination victories (e.g. technology), there aren\u2019t a wide variety of victory conditions.<br><br>2. The innovative research is great but it takes a game or two to really get used to it so some patience is recommended. <br><br>3. There is some exploration but it could use more events and anomalies to spice it up.<br><br>4. The combat is fun and tactical but isn\u2019t as pretty as some other games.<br><br>5. A Battle Arena to test designs would have been great but unfortunately not in the game.<br><br>6. The tutorials are very limited so checking some Youtube videos might help.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21999381', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21999381' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21999381\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21999381' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21999381\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21999381', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21999381_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21999381_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22352359\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sporkmonger\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"264250\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5da1ee3b5c407f547cfbf7cf7489e8143886cf6b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5da1ee3b5c407f547cfbf7cf7489e8143886cf6b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5da1ee3b5c407f547cfbf7cf7489e8143886cf6b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sporkmonger\/\" data-miniprofile=\"264250\">Sporkmonger<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sporkmonger\/games\/?tab=all\">2,257 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sporkmonger\/recommended\/\">76 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sporkmonger\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">78.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have mixed feelings.<br><br>I think this game probably has the best tech tree of any 4X game ever and that's saying something. The tech tree is original, fun, allows for rapid adaptation of strategy, but really, most importantly, it shows us something new that we haven't really seen before in the increasingly tired and already-done-before 4X genre by splitting fundamental and applied sciences and allowing research focusing w\/ priorization. True game design innovations don't really happen that often, but this game genuinely has one in its tech tree.<br><br>Other people have criticized the game's tendency to go &quot;on the rails&quot; (i.e. the game plays itself), and I don't agree. I played in a galaxy w\/ 800 stars and if you don't have macroeconomic automation, that just gets tedious. And most of the automation is around invasion and colonization, which are things I *really* don't want to micromanage. But if you do, the game absolutely lets you. The automated construction of planetary buildings seemed totally fine to me because most planets can only get a very limited subset of buildings anyway and if you wanted to micro it without going nuts, you could use build queue templates to do that. I personally found myself wishing the automation was even more automated than it is. One thing that kept cropping up for me was that some planets would max population and all population would be completely allocated. Only unallocated population can be used to colonize a planet and the automated colony ships would queue up at fully allocated planets, waiting for 1000 population to free up when that was impossible instead of just going to a planet where it was actually possible for population growth to happen. That forced me to micro a bit to unblock my expansion and by late game, that was pretty unwelcome. That said, the population growth mechanics in general just seemed really artificial and strange.<br><br>Fleet combat is OK. Not great, not bad, just OK. I'd have liked to see more utility modules that give more variation in strategy. Weapon variety starts to fall over near the end of the game where high damage torpedoes become increasingly critical and alpha damage starts being more important than anything else. Basically I think fleet combat in general needs more variety and balance tweaks. Shields should recharge much more quickly, kiting should be a more viable strategy, utility modules should get more emphasis, broadside combat should get more emphasis for capital ships (i.e. put all the big hardpoints on broadsides, small turrets only for 360). There should be utilities that can only be placed on smaller and medium ships to force fleet variety instead of the usual 4X late game battleships-only BS.<br><br>Espionage system is utterly useless and feels like it was tacked on as an afterthought. Diplomacy system is better than average, though I felt like AI was perhaps a little too aggressive diplomatically speaking on Normal and Hard difficulties.<br><br>But I think the biggest complaint I have is the end game. I won't spoil it for you, but due to what I believe is a known bug, the win condition can become completely impossible because certain enemies have unbounded growth. That said, as I was getting to late game and essentially steam rolling everything in sight and thinking, &quot;Man, game got too easy all of a sudden&quot;, the game flipped things around and made things much more challenging.<br><br>I have very mixed feelings though on the end game. It's sort of the opposite of deus ex machina. Out of nowhere, with no prior warning, you essentially get a boss fight that you likely were not preparing for. At least in MOO, you know the Orions are a thing and you probably have to fight them at some point. In Polaris, poof, Big Bad, and now things are going horribly wrong. There's no strategy you just have to research stuff fast enough and then build up a big fleet before the Big Bad gets too big. If they get too big, welp, too bad, you lose. Or rather you don't lose but you can't win. And that sucks.<br><br>Should you buy it? Depends on if you can stomach the current just-shy-of-AAA price tag. I think it's a good 4X game with by far the best tech tree of any 4X, but it's crippled by a bad end game and inconstent AI that's either way too hard or way too easy and uninspiring fleet combat. Overall, I liked it. I got a good 30+ hours out of it over a couple games. I think the endgame badly needs a patch. I think the rest of my criticism needs a sequel. I don't think this will end up being a game that I drop 100+ hours on though, and that's usually the point where I feel $40+ is justified.<br><br>Depending on what the modding community releases though, I could definitely see myself revisiting the title and getting my full $40's worth.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22352359', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22352359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22352359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22352359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22352359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22352359', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22352359_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22352359_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t54 of 70 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22039614\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"44950058\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/03\/030fb84125879370395ab093df9e78fc18c09f22.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/03\/030fb84125879370395ab093df9e78fc18c09f22.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/03\/030fb84125879370395ab093df9e78fc18c09f22_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/\" data-miniprofile=\"44950058\">geraldkr<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/games\/?tab=all\">562 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198005215786\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">216.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIts not good and its not bad as well, what irritates me is the major micro management, like when you have carriers and fighters are destroyed, it just does not refill them by itself, you first have to go to a planet, build them again manually, load them manually into carrier hangar, that is a bit tedious. The other thing is when fighters missiles is finished in a battle, you have to tell them manually to go and refill, first land them, then launch them again, no auto refill.<br>The ship design is ok, i like it but still LOVE Star Drive 1 ship design.<br><br>At this moment for me the best game still is Distant Worlds Universe. I just love the scale and the private sector system. Only drawback, you cannot terraform and ship design is a bit tedious or crap way. If it had like Star Drive 1 ship design then the game would have been complete.<br><br>I find the AI in Polaris Sector not so good when it comes to politics. I have tried several games now and its basically, give me this planet or these resources and if you say no its war. The AI declares war very quickly, basically like Star Drive 2. So the politics not so good in Polaris Sector.<br><br>At this moment i will give it a YES but just barely made me choose YES.

days to a week to finish one game, and each game is different, each star system is re done each new game load, so re play value.<br><br>200+ hours tested on the beta, with 13 hours spent pre release

graphics. But it makes up for it with these things.<br>- Formidable AI that can ruthlessly crush you if you turn the difficulty up.<br>- Research system is different from other 4X games in a good way.<br>- Ship designing is fun.<br>- Good challenging tactical combat. A thinkers game not only strategicly but tacticly as well.<br>- Unusual spy system. You build stealth ships that spy instead of sending agents.<br><br>The only thing i could wish for is--<br>-The techtree has about average numbers of tech but there is room for more tech. But that's a common thing we always wish for in 4X games.<br>-No characters such as governors or fleet commanders.<br>-No campaign but that part is kinda expected of a 4X game.<br><br>It has room to grow but overall it's a good game that's worth the money if you need a braintwister game right now.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22203625', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22203625' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22203625\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22203625' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22203625\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22203625', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22203625_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22203625_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25293541\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007033308\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46767580\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007033308\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46767580\">sandman2575<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007033308\/games\/?tab=all\">133 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007033308\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007033308\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery much worth picking up for fans of space 4x.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNON TECHNICAL VERSION:The games good fun and different from other 4x's but its annoying at the same time don't get me wrong its fun and rewarding but things happen that just annoy the player like invasion forces dissapearing which made me lose my war that was turning into my favour just because my whole ground army vanished from the transports along with that causing my warfleet to be stuck in that planets orbit allowing pirates to destroy every single orbital structure i had which made my empire fall apart but thats the game and the challenge about it i do recommend giving it a try even though this glitch was weird maybe it was just they starved to death since my farm planets were destroyed by the drill(annoying ugly things) but weak in tech but so far its just been negitive so heres the possitives that makes this game a buy to start it takes parts from other games that are really good and brings them into one big game at first you will fail no chance youll even have a idea what your doing and its trial and error which gives you the rewarding factor of succeeding at making a empire like me where the army starved to death which is the trial and error system that truthfully even though its annoying and horrible its actually fun like 5 min after it happens its weird all the sudden i find the joy in that fail with food management and are ready to try again <br>TECHNICAL VERSION: This game is a good 4x game that brings elements from other famous 4xs into one the ship building is great you have to think of each part and generally what the role of the ship is and have to use the tech you currently have which brings us to the tech tree its different then any other ive seen really some may hate it but i like it it has bars for how much persentage of your scientists time goes into math cemistry physics and biology which will increase and lower speed some tech becomes researched which is great since you choose your focus instead of tech trees this game also has a fuel system where it'll limit jumps you can do without refueling at a planet you or a ally own to get more fuel you need fuel containers the more you add to a ship and the more advanced it is makes the ship take longer and will need more resources to build which makes you have to think more on if you have a more advanced smaller fleet or a less advanced huge fleet ground forces play a important role letting you conquer planets and defend your own planets but will consume food thus they can starve if you run out of food so balancing the perpose of planets is needed each planet has bonuses in a material production science or food the planets specialty should be what you use it for the last thing i want to point out is the AI its incredible attacks at prime moments to try to take you out for example the human republic started a war with me the drill who conquered another space empire that had space near me also declared war since they thought i couldn't attack on two front which was true but they never reached my core systems intact this continued on till  my food ran out and my military starved and my war fleet was stranded above a planet i wouldve conquered if my army didnt starve <br>SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME: Yes if you want wait till it goes on sale and give it a try if you don't like it get a refund simple as that but i do recommend you try it and if your like me at first youll hate it since you cant do like anything right but after 2-3 attempts you start to understand i should do this maybe i should try that and youll start to love the game for what it is which is a great 4x that will knock you down and beat you up at first then you get that sense of acheivement when you kick it in the face and beat the game\t\t\t\t\t<div

But you can turn off micromangement in Distant Worlds to the point that the game could play itself -- your options to do this are limited in Polaris.<br><br>I'll recomment Polaris Sector because many will like its style over Distant Worlds, but I strongely suggest you put them both in your library.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26247202', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26247202' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26247202\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26247202' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26247202\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26247202', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26247202_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26247202_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25957812\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197992322819\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"32057091\">Silinary<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 59.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs many have mentioned, there is a lot this game does very well. On the downside, there could be more tooltips thaty tell what does what, but I have also found some of what I need just by RTFM. I see a review that didn't know what economic and scientic treaties benefit.  What they do is open up additional dialogs to let you buy minerals or barrow minerals with interest in the case of economic and buy\/trade technologies (if they are willing) for research treaties. There have been numerous times I find myself running out of plutonium  but have an extreme excess of another mineral and with 3 or 4 races in economic treaties, I could buy enough plutonium to keep my ship factories working while I adjusted mining planets for more extractors of a certain type (in this case plutonium) or  colonized new worlds to specifically mine the mineral.  Every planet can be colonized with the right technology with 1-3 planets per system and hundreds of systems, there is a lot to manage.  At the same time, the AI helps a lot in intuitive ways.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25957812', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25957812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25957812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25957812' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25957812\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25957812', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25957812_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25957812_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25878921\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198033287437\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"73021709\">Shailo<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 72.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPolaris Sector is a decent 4X space game but one in which you will very likely fall into a micro-management pit simply because the AI is not up to the task of managing planets in a sensible manner.<br><br>For example, upon deciding to colonize a planet you will be asked what specialization the planet will have, and the AI does a good job of building *exactly* that: be it innovation, industrial, food or mining focus. But that focus is way too narrow since it often doesn't build factories despite that fact that a few factories would speed up construction of desired facilities. And planets will also need some defense that, without factories, can literally take you centuries to build.<br><br>Granted that you can import defensive units from elsewhere, but it involves serious micro-management as you build the pieces elsewhere and ferry them over. And then you realize that this defense needs to be kept up to date, and taking it apart and moving it and updating it and bringing it back is a tedious mini-game in and of itself. And, of course, the AI doesn't worry about defense anyway so you are forever scanning the galaxy to find out what planets have defense and which don't. Nor can you tell all planets to automatically keep their defense up-to-date.<br><br>Another problem with Polaris Sector is in how you design ships. <br><br>Designing ships involves selecting a pre-defined hull and allocating the bits and pieces that you want. Turrets have pre-defined positions and size, but what you put in those turrets it up to you, be that lasers or missiles or energy blasts. The internals is largely an open area with fixed walls and allocations for engines and additional weaponry.<br><br>The problem, though, is that the components are of fixed size and orientation, and getting things to fit in the space is tricky since a component that might have a 6x4 size emphatically cannot be rotated 90 degrees to fit it in a 4x6 space. There are also absurd and arbitrary restrictions, and bizarre asymmetries. Some ship types cannot have Fighter Bays or armor, while others are restricted to small engines despite their huge hull. A weapon mount might double or quadruple the number of weapons in the mount for all weapons except for one or two that are identical except for the warhead. One side of a parallel internal section might be one size more narrow while the other side might be one or two sizes shorter. And then there are the round spaces in which you try to fit rectangular objects, and the nooks and juts that deliberately obstruct placement.<br><br>You can excuse objects of fixed size, but fixed orientation is dumb. You can excuse preset hulls, but being unable to apply known technologies to them all equally is dumb. And you'd think that those who designed a ship would know how to use a ruler, and you'd think that they'd accommodate to the world's restrictions rather than blindly stumbling over them. But no. The net result is that you end up spending a lot of time fiddling and fighting with a deliberately obstructive layouts rather than getting on with the job of designing your ship and moving on. <br><br>The last problem that I will mention is ground combat since the assault forces that you deploy *never* improve with advancements in technology, so your forces can still struggle against opponents who are several generations behind you technologically. Meaning that the only option that you are given is to overwhelm the enemy with numbers, and that is pathetically dumb.<br><br>In sum, Polaris Sector is an engaging 4X space strategy game where the research and technology is interesting, the real-time combat largely makes sense, but the AI is not up to the task of properly managing hundreds of planets, designing ships pointlessly eats up way too much time, and ground combat is nothing more than overwhelming the enemy with numbers. It is fun and interesting to play but it will try your patience more than once.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25878921', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25878921' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25878921\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25878921' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25878921\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25878921', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25878921_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25878921_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25834608\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197993065396\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"32799668\">venusius<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 122.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a little gem. It borrowed the best of the the 4x titles and implented it all in this game. Granted it's a little rough around the edges with its graphics and combat but overall this is a fun game. My only criticism is the combat system. I think it needs some improvement as I feel all the time and effort I spent on ship design is not translating in combat as it's dominated heavily by fighters. The tactics become one dimensional wherein all you do is build cheap carriers and torpedo fighters and you'll win battles easily. ie. 10 frigates carrying 50+ torpedo fighters each. Frigates stay far back and fighters do bombing runs (returning to hangar for torpedo replenishment). Gone are the big ship battles with this game. I still recommend it as it's not too expensive. I recommend buying it on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25834608', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25834608' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25834608\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25834608' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25834608\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25834608', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25834608_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25834608_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25821644\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007720169\/recommended\/418250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"47454441\">m00t eye shine shine<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNot a bad 4x game... its just the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing space faring koalas, et al, that seem to be a requirement for so many 4x games that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s me off.<br><br>What are you pulling through ya, SoftWarWare?
