I have played more than my fair share of anime\/visual novel games, and they have emotion; but this... This is next-level feels.. Infinity\/10 The best game I've ever played, it's so full of feeling and emotion and the story is a beautiful one, it keeps you on edge and wondering through the whole thing!

That said, its legendary status is only made apparent after reading all three games: Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative (note that this Steam title includes both Extra and Unlimited). While I would be cautious to recommend only Extra and Unlimited, I wholeheartedly recommend them in the context of the entire trilogy. Extra is redeemed by Unlimited and you will be thoroughly rewarded with Alternative.<br><br>This is a difficult game to explain without spoilers. So difficult, in fact, that the official Steam description and preview video delve into spoiler territory. Regardless, I will try to stay spoiler-free.<br><br>Muv-Luv is a visual novel trilogy and franchise that is highly celebrated in both Japan and the west. On EGS (Japanese), Alternative is ranked the #3 VN of all time. On VNDB (English), Alternative is ranked the #1 VN of all time by a significant margin (July 2016).<br><br>This Steam title, Muv-Luv, includes the first two parts of the trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited.<br><br>I implore you to not skip straight to Unlimited (Part 2). Extra (Part 1), despite being slow, is a requirement to fully set the characters and tone for the sequels. This series truly is something special, but only when read in full.<br><br>Muv-Luv Extra is your generic anime high-school rom-com. The MC, Takeru, is your generic self-insert protagonist. Meiya is the generic affluent ojou-sama. Sumika is the generic short-tempered childhood friend. Ayamine is the generic Rei expy. I could go on.<br><br>While Extra is not terrible, it's nothing special on its own. It's leagues better than many VNs on Steam, that's for sure, but its real purpose is to build up the characters and set the scene for the remaining two games.<br><br>Unlimited--which is included in this release--is where things start to get unique and interesting (sci-fi, mecha, drama) but you must read Extra to fully appreciate it (and also to eventually appreciate Alternative, which is god-tier).<br><br>ART: Despite being an old game, Muv-Luv's art holds up surprisingly well. The rUGP engine was ahead of its time, and that helps breathe life into the visuals for Muv-Luv. The artwork itself, while aged, has an undeniable charm that keeps it fresh even in the age of perfectly polished HD assets.<br><br>MUSIC: You may have heard that Muv-Luv has an incredible soundtrack. Anyone saying that is referring to Alternative, which does have a phenomenal OST. Unfortunately, this is not true for Extra nor Unlimited. The slice of life soundtracks are repetitive in the worst way and there's not a wide variety of them.<br><br>VOICE: The voices, overall, are pretty good. I would prefer to have a fully voiced MC, but the performances from the rest of the voice actors make up for it.<br><br>ANIMATION: Muv-Luv was made long before the Live-2D or e-Mote systems were implemented and stood out as having brilliant animation for its time. The animation, especially in this renewed edition, still stands strong. You won't see most of the animated scenes until Unlimited (and only then ultimately polished in Alternative), but these scenes further down the line make you feel like you're watching a well-choreographed cutscene.<br><br>STORY: The series is praised for good reason. Unfortunately, it doesn't shine until Unlimited and doesn't fully blossom until Alternative. You will have to trust me on this one: Extra is a slow trudge, but you'll be happy to have not skipped it when reading Alternative.<br><br>This ended up longer than I expected. Should you buy this game? Yes, absolutely.

It's an introspective epic, full of action, comedy, and pathos. I consider it a masterpiece, not only within its genre, but among all contemporary fiction.<br><br>If you are at all interested in mecha, this is a must-play. If you are enjoy military fiction (e.g. <i>Starship Troopers<\/i>), you will love this. If you want visceral drama -- if you want to feel hope, horror, sadness, and relief -- this game will take your emotions for a ride. If you want to read something with intricate detail in military operations and quantum mechanics, this is it.<br><br>Yet it's difficult to recommend.<br><br>Muv-Luv is a visual novel (all story, no gameplay) originally released in 2003. It comprises the first two entries in the Muv-Luv trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited. The final and most renowned entry, Muv-Luv Alternative, was released as a separate product in 2006, and, accordingly, the English localization will be sold separately.<br><br>If that's confusing: don't worry about it. Point is, this game is only 2\/3rds of the full Muv-Luv experience, but it's the entire original game. For the purposes of this review, I'm looking at the series as a whole.<br><br>Why is Muv-Luv difficult to recommend to newcomers? The main reason is its sheer length. Extra and Unlimited together (that is, this Steam product) will probably take an average reader 40+ hours to complete. Alternative is about another 50+ hours on top of that. The whole series is bigger than most other VNs, including Clannad, Fate\/stay night, and YU-NO. It has more words than <i>War and Peace<\/i> twice over, or all the Harry Potter books put together. It is <b>long<\/b>.<br><br>If that scares you, turn back now.<br><br>Still with me? Of course, the prose is nowhere near as dense as <i>War and Peace<\/i>, and a very large portion is voiced dialogue that goes at a comfortable peace. The series has highly advanced graphics by VN standards, with moving sprites, traditional animation, and 3D scenes, and a phenomenal soundtrack featuring JAM Project. It's not a dry read by any means.<br><br>But compounding the issue of length is that the game doesn't fully blossom until its final part, Muv-Luv Alternative. The themes that compose its central drama are merely touched upon in Extra, and Unlimited only goes toe-deep into the pool. For that reason, there are some who advocate skipping Extra, or Extra and Unlimited, entirely.<br><br>There's some merit to the idea. Frankly, Extra isn't anything special by itself. It's a generic romantic comedy, albeit a fun and amusing one, with little of import to say. Unlimited is largely the same thing, except with a change in milieu and some minor mecha elements.<br><br>However, I strongly recommend against skipping straight to Alternative. Not only would you lose out on crucial story, foreshadowing, and character development, it would be missing the entire point of Muv-Luv.<br><br>I have been intentionally scant on plot details throughout this review, but I can safely say this: Muv-Luv is about what we take for granted. It's about the duty one bears not only to himself, but to his country and his loved ones. The protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, lives a blissful, unaware life at the story's beginning. By the end, he will be confronted and challenged time and again, forced to evaluate himself and strive toward virtue.<br><br>The banality of Extra, then, is a crucial part of the experience. It grounds ourselves (as readers) in a world similar to our own, if slightly wackier and more harem-centric. When that carefree lifestyle is taken away from our protagonist, we feel the loss too. And when glimpses of it return later on -- fragments of peace amid despair -- we cherish it all the more.<br><br>What Muv-Luv does is bold and unusual. The first 20+ hours that a reader invests into the series are of enormously different character than its greatest part. Pragmatically speaking, that isn't bearable for most people, especially since it's polarizing content in its own right (being anime-inspired, reliant on Japanese culture, etc.).<br><br>Moreover, even when Muv-Luv is at its best, it's not the sort of writing that will appeal to all tastes. Lengthy action scenes are marked by even lengthier build-ups, and there are frequent monologues during periods of reflection. And tangential \u201cinfodump\u201d scenes break up the pace to flesh out the world and explain events in more detail than practically necessary. These aspects make for excellent immersion and worldbuilding (think <i>The Lord of the Rings<\/i>), but can be off-putting to a reader looking for nothing more than hot-blooded action and drama.<br><br>So Muv-Luv is not for everybody.<br><br>But I love this game and wish for it to be loved by more. <br><br>If you haven't played a visual novel before, but find what I've said appealing and aren't scared away by the copious amounts of moe, give it a shot! If you are a fan of visual novels but haven't played Muv-Luv, what are you waiting for? It's a masterpiece.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24326059', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24326059' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24326059\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24326059' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24326059\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24326059', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24326059_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24326059_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24382458\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oobie10\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"34946107\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oobie10\/\" data-miniprofile=\"34946107\">oobie10<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oobie10\/games\/?tab=all\">320 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oobie10\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/oobie10\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttl;dr: Good title, becomes excellent when combined with its sequel, Alternative, which is not yet released.<br><br>Ignore the play time, I've read the series before this Steam release. <br><br>First things first: if you plan to read the entire series (or even just Alternative), go in as blind as you can for the best experience. DON'T google search, DON'T search Youtube, DON'T go to wikis, as these are all places where you will likely encounter spoilers in some fashion. Even if you don't run into a spoiler directly, any site with comments has a high potential of *that guy* who likes to spoil things because he wants to be a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. <br><br>Muv-luv is a highly acclaimed series of Visual Novels, much of which is focused on Alternative, the third part of the trilogy which has not yet been released. This title contains the first two parts, Extra and Unlimited, which I believe are essential to the experience. While Alternative is where the rollercoaster is most thrilling, the climb up provided by the two parts in this title enhance the experience, and in my opinion, are pretty good themselves.<br><br>Extra is the first part of the trilogy, and it is a fairly standard Slice of Life High School Romcom. It establishes many of the important characters in the series, and has some foreshadowing of future events. Its most important role is to establish emotional connections between you and the characters in a carefree environment. If you find this part unbearable, the main route(s) to read for plot are Sumika's and\/or Meiya's. These two routes are largely the same, except for the ending, and completing these two were originally required before unlocking Unlimited. The other routes obviously delve more in-depth with the other heroines, and also introduce a few side characters who pop up later, but are not necessary to the main story. <br><br>Unlimited is the second part; in this Steam version, it is unlocked from the start, but I would highly recommend reading at least one of Sumika\/Meiya in Extra before reading Unlimited. The genre shift from Extra to Unlimited was originally a surprise, but over time it has become rather well known, and even a selling point for the franchise. It is spoiled in the preview video, but I can't blame them when the part of the franchise that most people think of is after the genre shift. Most of the side stories and spinoff VN titles are concerned with either Unlimited or Alternative, and the world most think of when talking about Muv-luv is introduced in Unlimited. The routes in Unlimited are nearly identical, save for a couple unique romance scenes; completing any character's route is more or less the same as finishing any other, though each route has the same two variations of endings. If you don't have a favorite character to choose at this point, Meiya's route is probably the best option story-wise. Unlimited has a significant amount of world-building; some find it tedious, others fascinating. I fall in the latter camp, but regardless, understanding the world established in Unlimited is important for understanding Unlimited and, ultimately, Alternative. Let's just say the ending is rather...abrupt.<br><br>Much of the hype understandably goes towards Alternative, but I would still recommend buying this title as well. I found Extra more tolerable that others, it seems, and found Unlimited quite enjoyable. On its own, I might recommend waiting for a deal before purchase, but upon finishing Alternative, I believe buying both titles at full price is well worth the cost. There is some debate whether it's worth buying something when you only experience an enhanced payoff in a later title, but I would recommend getting both. Having some time between the releases is useful in a couple ways; it gives you time to digest what happened in Extra and especially Unlimited before diving back into the world with Alternative, and if you find Extra or Unlimited tedious, there's plenty of time to get through it before Alternative arrives.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24382458', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24382458' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24382458\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24382458' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24382458\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24382458', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24382458_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24382458_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25723038\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052962042\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"92696314\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052962042\/\" data-miniprofile=\"92696314\">Reav-x<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052962042\/games\/?tab=all\">57 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052962042\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052962042\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-I have read the entire series and more MLE, MLU, MLA.  + <br><br>So as you can see on the other reviews many people praise this VN. <br>Yet if you google muv luv reviews you will see a few of the more well known sites bashing it. <br>So what gives? <br><br>I'll talk first about the things that the review sites dislike about the game. <br><br>ML; Extra. <br>Lots of people I know pick up the ML series due to the MLU and MLA parts of it but they hate the idea of trodging through extra. <br>Extra is a slice of life anime styled story where the main char has a harem. <br>I know lots of people reading this will instantly cringe at that idea as it really only resonates with otaku weeb trash and I'd agree, I am not really into such stories my self. <br>However. <br>MLE is a prolouge, its just very very long and its not that bad either, as a person who avoided all slice of life and especialy harem '\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t' I'll say that MLE is very worth going through. For me if this game was only MLE I'd not buy it I admit but if you combine it with MLU and MLA it makes sense and enriches the other two stories. <br><br>A porn game;<br>This was the other biggest complaint people seem to have. <br>When it was released the ML series was classed as Eroge which is basicaly otaku for a VN with porno scenes in it. <br>If you look up at the screen shots you will see pictures of the 'flight' suits that are revealing for no other reason than fan service and people seem to blast that too. <br>Problem is. Fan service will exist in most forms of anime\/VN\/LN its just a thing. <br>Why hate on a game's story simply because you see boobs? <br>Do boobs ofend you? If it does why are you bothering with the review section? Its clear they are in the game. <br>The steam version is the all ages version so all sex scenes are removed but as a person who has read sex scenes I can tell you they were shoe horned into the game only to appeal to the pervy otakus back in 2001 when it was EXPECTED to have those types of scenes, Fate stay night another famous VN which has since had succsesful anime ALSO had these types of scenes. <br>As a side note for people who are waiting for the 18+ patch take my advice when I say the sex scenes are pretty bad and just put into it 'because' if you really want porn there are plenty of free sites I am sure you know about already. <br>TLDR; The game is not about sex. It has sexual content with the 18+ patch that will come eventualy but its not worth caring about. People bashing the sexual content in this game are prudes. If you are prude avoid and gtfo. <br><br>Story<br>Of all things some sites bash the story. <br>As a person who has finished the series I will say that for me out of all the games I have played over the past 24 years (alot) and as a person who focuses on story driven games when Im going single player-<br>This is the best story of them all. <br>It has to be due to the games nature but this story is amazing. <br>It will make you FEEL something about what is going on. <br>If you have a soul you WILL cry at certain points. <br>You will think about it will you study or are at work, you won't be able to wait to know what happens next and after its all over and you clear MLA you will feel like you just walked through hell and came out alive with all the good and bad feelings to go with that. <br>For me story wise you would have to get into some serious novels to get anything better. <br>I am talking about enjoyment factor and the idea of caring about what is going on in this game. <br><br>If you are a person who enjoys anime in general then you need to read this, it is your duty. <br>If you enjoy Sci Fi and are no put off by any of the other content you have seen so far then you have to read this. <br>If you enjoy a bit of romance in your action story then you have to read this. <br>If you are a weeb, i guess you have already read this and if not you are a slacker. <br>If you like mecha this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on any other mecha story out there. <br>If you like reading and don't mind anime themed stuff then read this. <br><br>If you get offended at any of the screen shots I guess you have to pass but thats your issue really and its you who will miss out simply because you can't see past the cover. <br><br>9999\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25723038', 'summary' );

By Now you've seen all the reviews from all the people who have played it before. Every single one basically has the same message, put out in different terms. But you're there wondering, okay, I'm a noob, I don't know VN, or any of this stuff, and I've never played Muv-Luv. Where's my voice so I can make an educated decision?<br><br>I'm that voice.<br><br>Heads up, I've been aware of VN's but never been able to get them or figure any way of making them work, so the closest I've gotten to this kind of game is my love for anime\/manga\/manhwa. That, and reading some reviews and getting the genre shift spoiled for me is as far as I had knowledge wise heading in.<br><br>First thing's first. I loved Muv-Luv Extra. I loved the characters. The humor made me laugh. I enjoyed the world. I enjoyed the different routes I played. I enjoyed the harem aspect. I enjoyed working to find one route\/girl to pick and seeing where it went. I enjoyed the cartoons\/journal drawings. I think Meiya is best girl, but ayamine is most interesting. I liked the mutual violence between Sumika and the MC. I was happy playing that game. I do not agree with other's who say that that Extra is trash. Even without playing Alternative, maybe because I haven't played a thousand other games just like Extra, I had a blast. Do I believe Alternative is the best ever, and ties in and builds up the other two? A hundred thousand times yes. I was looking for forshadowing but couldn't really find or feel any, so if they are as intertwined as promised my mind is really blown.<br><br>Why am I so confident that Alternative is everything they are promising us it is?<br><br>Unlimited is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing awesome. If Extra made me happy, Unlimited got me pumped. The  production values went through the roof, and there were so many cooooooooollll moments and plot stuff. It was like if you liked Code Geass, but you got to sit in it and read it and enjoy it in immersion at your own pace. And it felt like this was only the first half of season one. Meaning I could kinda sense I still had like 2 or 3 wild balls to the walls arcs to go. I don't think I'll be dissapointed in the payoff.<br><br>Let's be clear though. This was not meaningless build up just for Alternative. Even if I die before Alternative is released or it goes dark, I won't be sad for my time or money. 9.5\/10. Great story. Great Fun.

I'll just say how it went for me.<br><br>There are three parts in the Muv Luv Trilogy. Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative.<br><br>When I first started reading Extra, it seemed inane and cliche. It took me several months to get through it, because I wasn't really particularly invested.<br><br>When I hit Unlimited, suddenly it became pretty interesting! Still a little slow, but I was hooked. I played it when I had spare time over the course of a week or so.<br><br>When I hit Alternative, I literally could not put it down for anything. I literally did not sleep for nearly 72 hours until I finished it. By the end I was a complete emotional wreck.<br><br>Coming back to Extra, it's very emotional experience on your second playthrough. Everything I didn't care about before seems much more important, and there's lots of subtle little foreshadowing.<br><br>I'll admit that this game is the weaker half of the trilogy. But I still think it's absolutely worth it, and if purchased with its sequel (expected release winter 2016), then I'd absolutely recommend it. It goes places you won't expect, and has one of the roughest emotional rollercoasters I've ever experienced.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24345072', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24345072' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24345072\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24345072' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24345072\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24345072', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24345072_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24345072_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>9 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24325999\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"108267113\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2a8a4d6f25c80a9eaa33fab04a3e233b8947eff.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2a8a4d6f25c80a9eaa33fab04a3e233b8947eff.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f2a8a4d6f25c80a9eaa33fab04a3e233b8947eff_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/\" data-miniprofile=\"108267113\">poutchouli<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/games\/?tab=all\">70 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/a_hora_a_day\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">39.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI spent like 30 minutes trying to type a review but nothing I do can serve muv-luv justice. You'd be better off reading the reviews by Dexomega and RockmanDash online, seriously. I'll simplify my view with this short piece that really shows the extent of my writing skills:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Extra: 6.5\/10<br>  <\/li><li>Unlimited: 8\/10<br>  <\/li><li>Alternative (not out yet): 10\/10<\/li><\/ul><br>However, after reading Alternative I felt like giving both Extra and Unlimited a 10\/10 because of how \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 well they did at setting up the story and attaching you to the characters.<br><br>    You've seen\/read the Lord of the Ring trilogy right? Imagine Extra and Unlimited as Frodo's time in the Shire up to Rivendell and the journey ends just before the fellowship is formed. Seems a bit lame right? Though enjoyable, it's unfullfilled, it had potential, but didn't go as far as it could. However, Muv-Luv Alternative comes along and finished up the Fellowship of the Ring, Twin Towers, and Return of the King. The beginning of the fellowship is damn good, but it wouldn't be good if that was it. That's muvluv. But its alright, because you're reading this for Alternative. You're reading the trilogy. I may seem like I'm underplaying how good extra and unlimited are, but I don't want you to go in with high expectations and not have them met. Save those expectations for Alternative. <br><br>Please read muv-luv. That's all I can say really without spoiling the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of the series. Also for the love of god don't skip Extra.<br><br><br><b>TL;DR: &quot;it da best&quot; (as a trilogy)<\/b><br><br><br>EDIT: I was told my review wasn't helpful or honest as I rated Alternative as a 10\/10 and not higher. I apologize and would like to fix that. I originally skipped over this as we don't have a number that would fully represent how \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 good Alternative is. I will go with the number suggested though I feel it still underrates Alternative.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Alternative (adjusted for bias): 15\/10<\/li><\/ul><br>EDIT PT. 2: I'd rate Extra higher than a 6.5 but as I said, I dont want to set expectations too high. But also there is one scene that doesn't have a pantyshot anymore. Granted I don't care for pantyshots, but that this point... it's become a nostalgic pantyshot. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Extra (adjusted for nostalgic pantyshot, new translation and not caring about setting expectations too high): 8\/10<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24325999', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24325999' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24325999\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24325999' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24325999\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24325999', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24325999_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24325999_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24325976\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077105674\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"116839946\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7f\/7f62b82991e1095882e640689e313fad826fee98.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7f\/7f62b82991e1095882e640689e313fad826fee98.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7f\/7f62b82991e1095882e640689e313fad826fee98_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077105674\/\" data-miniprofile=\"116839946\">Mr JC Denton in Da Fresh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077105674\/games\/?tab=all\">504 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077105674\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077105674\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Muv-Luv on July 14, 2016, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMuv-Luv is a franchise that first began as a visual novel way back in 2003, THIRTEEN years ago. It is only now that the game is officially available in English for the first time and on Steam. The Steam store page for Muv-Luv claims that it is the &quot;most highly-acclaimed visual novel series of all time&quot; and to be honest, that is actually possible. No VN series gained as much acclaim as Muv-Luv did, especially considering the age of the original VN. Muv-Luv to visual novels is like what Star Wars is to movies. It has gained sequels and spin-offs in the form of other VNs, manga and anime.<br><br>The Muv-Luv VN that you can purchase here is a story that comprises of two arcs; Extra and Unlimited. Extra starts out as what you can call your &quot;basic VN love story&quot; where the hero has to choose between girls but when the Unlimited arc starts, things kick into high gear. The series explores storytelling elements like timelines or alternate realities but what is prominent in all Muv-Luv media since the Unlimited arc is the fight of the human characters against aliens called the BETA (Beings of the Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race). And fans are drawn to the franchise's own spin on giant robots called TSFs (Tactical Surface Fighters). Unlike many other Japanese franchises, TSFs are named and based on real-world military aircraft. My favorite for example is the F-22A Raptor.<br><br>Since this is a VN, the gameplay (or lack of, if you're cynical) is what you would expect. Muv-Luv follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the differing scenarios of the female main characters. Personally, I think Muv-Luv has a lot more choices than most visual novels and the game has multiple plot lines that the player can follow, one for each heroine in the story, and there's supposedly nineteen possible endings. The game even fails you for making the wrong decision. To view all the plotlines, it is highly recommended to replay the game and make different decisions.<br><br>All in all, if you're into VNs, Muv-Luv is more than worth it to purchase and play through many times. It has an interesting world, characters and plot. You won't regret getting invested in the story. However, if you're not the type that plays visual novels or can't stand that much reading, then obviously it's best that you move on and play something else. If you play it and enjoy it, the story doesn't end there. Unlimited is followed by Muv-Luv: Alternative which should be released by the end of the year. And yes, there's going to be a R18+ patch, apparently. You can never have enough &quot;plot&quot;. <br><br>P.S. Despite what you hear from some people who already know the story, DON'T SKIP EXTRA!!! Yes, the game gives you the option of going straight into Unlimited which is the more &quot;exciting&quot; arc but if you truly want the full experience, play Extra first, ESPECIALLY if this is your first time playing Muv-Luv. Don't be afraid that you'll be wasting time just because somebody else says you would.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24325976', 'summary' );

Also, the Muv-Luv Extra is really ordinary and the setting is just too cliched (well, pretty reasonable considering about how old the game is).<br>   For Unlimited, I would say it is much better (It is the main story after all), but it lacks the tension that the mecha themed VNs are supposed to have, <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>for the entire game, the 207 squad never encoutered a single alien, and there is no actual combat in the battle field. Also, the endings are literally the same for all of the heronies.<\/span><\/span><br>   But I still recommand this game because.... well, it is Muv-Luv ya know. The prequel ya know.

I hated Extra with a passion, and skipped the entire stupid Lacrosse arc. However, the little bit of characterization you get out of it is worth it for Unlimited, and I'm assuming Alternative as well. While Extra sucks, take comfort in the fact that hardcore fans of Muv Luv say it sucks as well, for it really does get soooooo much better in the next games. Also, be very careful, as there are spoilers everywhere you look, even in some of these reviews. Just suffer through both main (Sumika and Meiya) routes of Extra, then never return to that terrible part, and enjoy the much better Unlimited and Alternative.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30179993', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30179993' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30179993\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30179993' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30179993\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30179993', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30179993_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30179993_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30159230\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/usmcjsdf\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"312468939\">\u6226\u8266Yamato<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the previous story of MUV-LUV Alternative, Muv-Luv talks a  legend talking about love, courage between Takero and his friends. If the world you known is totally destoried and human have to fight BETA desperately, what will you do to protct those you love? The setting is very intresting and those Tatical Surface Fighters are cool. I highly recommend the MUV series including Alternative, the Day After, Schwarzesmarken and novels. Although writers of these work really love disscussing people's selfishness, hopeless (which makes the your mood not that good, seriously), I am always moved by the heroic movenment made by characters. I will never forget those American A10 pilotes from 54th TSA SQ made their last stand in Germany to cover the retreat of civilians, Cpt Daryl and Will 's trust between each other, &quot; Marines won't die without permission, so Stay Alive&quot; or Meiya's last words when she died in Operation Sakura: Don't look down upon huamnity.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30159230', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30159230' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30159230\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30159230' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30159230\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30159230', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30159230_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30159230_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30128386\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971215858\/recommended\/449830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"10950130\">Ninja Squirrelz<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 36.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter initially struggling to get into Extra I managed to push on and found that I enjoyed the latter half and even ended up seeing all the endings.
