It's not as scary as The Thing, but it's pretty fun.<br><br>The story is you are a scientist in an outpost who is there to open a ice hole, but after opening it you find out that you let out a monster who can shape shift into your crew, so you have to figure out how to contain it.<br><br>The gameplay is not a point and click adventure game, but more of a choose an action and see how it pans out. You also have to take care of yourself, like sleep, eat, and bathe so you don't black out and have to backtrack to some place. You're given a bar which tells you how much time you have left until you black out and before every action you have a nifty time counter which tells you how time you will use up doing a certain action.<br><br>The puzzles are fairly simple. It revolves around exploration and using certain items in certain places. There's only one difficult puzzle, but after that it's a fairly simple ride. <br><br>Now let's talk about the monster itself. The monster is a lot like the monster in The Thing. As soon as you let it out, it moves around the map and hunts down your crew. The monster will kill them and will then shape shift into them. The only way to know which crew member is the monster is you being alone in the room with it. It will then shape shift into this crab creature and will kill you if you don't have anything to defend yourself with, but don't worry there are multiple weapons scattered around the map so you have plenty of chances to save yourself.<br><br>Atmosphere is also really good. Since the map is small and very claustrophobic, it helps build tension when you're among the final people alive.<br><br>The pixel art style is alright for the most part. It's nothing too special and I didn't mind it that much, but the soundtrack is a whole different story.<br><br>The soundtrack is beyond horrible. I liked the intro song, but the song that play's during the game is terrible. It was annoying and it wasn't that good.<br><br>The game has a few negatives as well.<br><br>The game has one big problem and that's the crew  AI. When you do certain actions, your crew members will also do something and this sometimes happens to be blocking doors. When you want to go somewhere and they're standing in front of the door, it's impossible to go through it. The monster is also sometimes a pain in the \u2665\u2665\u2665 to deal with. I had a run of the game where I was stuck in a room with the monster and I had no weapons, which forced me to restart the game from the start.<br><br>The game also has this strange bug where you can access the final area of the game without even solving the puzzle. Just by inspecting the door you can get through it, but the puzzle within the door isn't solvable. This issue has now been fixed.<br><br>The game lasted me 40 minutes to finish and for the current price I really cannot recommend it. It's way too short and I think if it was 5 euros that would be a better deal, but the game is definitely worth the time.<br><br>Overall I liked my time with Occurrence at JCR Outpost, it's a fun game inspired, by an awesome movie. If the issues are fixed and the prices is a bit lower this is a decent game that's worth your time.<br><br>Pros:<br>+ Great Atmosphere <br>+ Puzzles are well designed<br><br>Cons:<br>- Incredibly short<br><br>8\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24465818', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24465818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24465818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24465818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24465818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24465818', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24465818_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24465818_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/recommended\/468080\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24666974\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"54696931\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5932dc1361bbd1a5ab05100a674f20cdab17a8f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5932dc1361bbd1a5ab05100a674f20cdab17a8f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5932dc1361bbd1a5ab05100a674f20cdab17a8f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/\" data-miniprofile=\"54696931\">ferret<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/games\/?tab=all\">2,622 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daveferret\/recommended\/468080\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLet\u2019s start very briefly and clearly, if you know barely nothing about Occurrence at JCR Outpost and screenshots looks interesting to you, don\u2019t read any reviews and go for it. This way you can enjoy it.<br><br>You\u2019ve become an admin. Finally! Well ... The Antarctic research station admin. In a secluded area of permafrost you command tough guys who gather and analyse samples from under the ice. It\u2019s not an easy job, you suffer from isolation, monotonous work and desire to make a breakthrough in research. And suddenly it comes, an ice crack was identified. Your job as manager is to drive to the cracks, blow it up using dynamite and figure out what\u2019s in it and what new it brings. Simple task. But your command is not exactly an example of discipline. Guys can do almost whatever they want, and one of them unauthorised took the key from the garage with dynamite. First you have to find out who took it, and then continue on your mission.<br><br>Occurrence at first looks like a retro adventure with the flair of movie The Thing and Lucasfilm\u2019s adventure games from the \u201890s with the midi music and the sounds you probably don\u2019t even need a sound card for. In fact, it is rather a mini puzzle adventure game, because pure adventure game elements are only few and your goal is to perform a series of correctly chosen text options that lead to the goal. In the game you are moving only by selecting the right options and all you need is one finger on keyboard. You can move to the rooms, hold only one item at the same time, talk to a team member or just wait a while doing nothing. That\u2019s because the whole game is acting as if it takes place in real time. When you take an action, others do too, so to track down the owner of the keys you need to survey crew rooster and map to find out where he is and meet him. To make it more difficult, the game also features &quot;survival elements&quot; where you need to eat, relax or go to the toilet \/ take a shower. It slows you down and away from searching for the right people.<br><br>The main part of the game begins after completing the first task. From the crack under the ice &quot;IT&quot; appeared, and it goes after the crew and of course after you. In that moment, you have to perform tasks with great caution, because &quot;IT&quot; gradually kills crew members, you can hold only one item (a weapon, if possible) and get somewhere safe. The game is really pleasantly chilling with oppressive atmosphere at these moments and you feel like you\u2019re just a one step from death. And you\u2019re tired, hungry and you\u2019ve discovered another crack in a service shaft...<br><br>The problem of the game, however, is its brevity. During the first play you\u2019ll find out options, controls and strategy, and during the second play you no longer have a bigger problem. You\u2019ll find that &quot;survival&quot; features are not so important, because when you pass out nothing really happens and you just appear in another room. Crew members have nothing to say and to find the needed keys is just a matter of few keys presses. And &quot;IT&quot;? You can get defensive items in a few places and you are always one step ahead, so you can decide which way to escape.
