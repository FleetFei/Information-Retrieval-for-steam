There's something disrespectful about historical games like the early Call of Duty titles, which placed players into real wars that real people fought and died in, exploiting those experiences by transforming them into mindless entertainment for the masses. Tackling this kind of heavy subject matter requires a degree of nuance that bleak loadscreen quotations or pressing F to pay respects don't even begin to provide.<br><br>1979 Revolution: Black Friday doesn't share those problems. Created by Rockstar Games veteran and Iranian national Navid Khonsari, whose family escaped the turmoil the title aims to portray, the game tells the story of the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which lead to the deposition of the Shah of Iran and the end of the Pahlavi dynasty. The influence of this period in Iranian history cannot be understated, yet knowledge of this point in history remains woefully elusive to the American public consciousness.<br><br>It's fitting, then, that the game starts out with so much exposition. This isn't a Call of Duty title looking to capitalize on history as a mere backdrop to action-heavy gameplay. The Telltale-esque title places players into a series of unfolding events as an Iranian photojournalist recently returned home from Germany. Early in the story, players will take a walk through a protest-crowded street, snapping pictures and listening to their companion expound on the issues facing Iran leading up to the 1979 revolution. Westernization, income inequality, government censorship - the developers are clearly aware of their audience's unfamiliarity with the setting and do a fantastic job of the setting the stage for the players.<br><br>It all comes naturally; your character, after all, has been out of the country for awhile, so it stands to reason that he might need to be caught up on current events. After snapping a photo, players are presented with a quick blurb of information and given the option to learn more, leading them to small snippets of Iran's history in the game's journal.<br><br>Fortunately, unlike many titles tackling heavy subject matter, 1979 Revolution is at least somewhat able to stand on its own as an entertaining game. It's informative without being preachy, and engages players with choice and consequence and quick-time event systems Telltale Games or Life is Strange veterans will find immediately familiar.<br><br>1979 Revolution is best described as a political thriller, and it isn't long until your jaunt down exposition lane is interrupted by the proverbial \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hitting the fan. It's a character driven story, showing Iranian nationals with a variety of different political and religious views reacting as their country is turned upside down. The voice acting is crucially well executed, thanks to a cadre of veteran film actors. Almost everyone involved with the project has a prior work that I've seen or am at least familiar with; I recognized the voice of Mozhan Marn\u00f2 from The Blacklist, House of Cards, and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night immediately.<br><br>The game is an indie title though, and you can tell that the funds for its actors may have been diverted from other areas of its limited budget. The art assets in particular leave a bit to be desired; it will quickly become apparent that character models and animations are being reused for the game's extras. In a game like this though, pursuing flawless writing and voice acting for its characters ultimately should trump almost everything else.<br><br>1979 Revolution does end a bit abruptly. It's not as bad as say, The Banner Saga, but I was expecting the narrative to go on for an additional chapter, or maybe for it to show a bit more of the revolution's aftermath. It's not a bad ending per se, but it does sort of build and build and then just end in the middle of its own climax.<br><br>Overall, the game succeeds in bringing a historically accurate, better understanding of the titular revolution to those who play it. It's not a deep look and it doesn't get too bogged down in historical details, instead focusing broadly on the people of Iran as they lived through this formative moment in their nation's history. 1979 Revolution is worth checking out on that basis alone if you're interested in experiencing a sample of pre-revolution Iran and how it evolved to become the nation we have today.<br><br>If you're not interested in that, I'd find the the title harder to recommend. This is a game of ideas, and it follows that the title is inextricably linked to the message it wants its players to receive. Standing on its own, its narrative isn't as satisfying as a Telltale Game and its gameplay doesn't touch Life is Strange, but if you're generally interested in experiencing a bit of history, that can make the title shine.<br><br>1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a short game at just over two hours of total playtime, and is available on Steam for a full price of $12. I'll leave the value judgment up to you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22276383', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22276383' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22276383\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22276383' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22276383\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22276383', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22276383_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22276383_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t73 of 91 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>13 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22251524\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"77388266\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57faeaf2342da70b2f20d47ae33d8c20191d946a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57faeaf2342da70b2f20d47ae33d8c20191d946a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57faeaf2342da70b2f20d47ae33d8c20191d946a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/\" data-miniprofile=\"77388266\">Magic Dragon Smu-hmu-huh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/games\/?tab=all\">166 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037653994\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMang, What can i say about this game? <br>!!OTHER THAN IT'S ABOUT 2 HRS LONG!!<br>Want  numbers out of \/10? scroll down.<br><br>You're a photographer that is in an Iranian jail cell being interigated.

Now that I finished my first time playing it, as much as I hate to ruin the 69 reviews I thought I could share my thoughts:<br><br>I can't recall any other game that really focused on a historical event like this and not only told the story but also let the player become a part of it. You can make some choices that really help your character or the ones around him, or be their doom. That's already something that quite a few big game titles don't manage.<br>But the story telling is flawed. Some characters have no personality or are so rarely there that there is really no reason to care for them, and there aren't many characters to begin with. I ended up only caring for two characters, and the second mostly just because his role just hit home for me.<br>And just when things are really heating up, the game ends. And it's not even a big ending that really feels like one, it's more like listening to music and during the chorus your speakers just suddenly die. A lot of questions should have been answered, but aren't even mentioned again, and you simply don't get much deeper into what was happening which is a pity.<br><br>The gameplay was not that interesting for me aside from choosing what to say and occasionally how to act. What you can do most of all is looking for things and collecting them, which then give you a little insight on both what was happening during the revolution and also Iranian culture as it was back then and still is now, which is neat for those who don't know much about Iran but still perhaps too little for those who really know nothing.<br>More important information can be collected by taking photos, and you do that in a very basic &quot;click at the right moment&quot; minigame. Depending on how well the photo turns out, the more information you get.<br>There's also everybody's favourite thing in gaming history: Quick time events! *sarcasm*<br>Also, on two occasions I had to patch up people who were hurt and I have to say that that were just silly. Especially having to put bandages around the wounds, it looked really bad and out of place compared to the style in the rest of the game.<br><br>The game looks alright. It's rather obvious to tell which character models were worked on longer and which ones were rushed, and in just one scene, standing on one spot, I could count up to almost 10 copy-pasted NPCs. But I really did like the style they went with and enjoyed looking at the character I play. The environments were also done nicely, it really reminded me of walking down a street in Tehran.<br><br>I have the luck of rarely ever getting glitches and such in games, but there was this one point where I walked into a half circle of people in the hope that I could collect something in the middle, but then Babak closed the circle and I couldn't get out because he just wouldn't move. I had to restart the whole sequence and stay away from groups from then on which probably made me miss out on some things.<br><br>So, tl;dr: while this game is very flawed, it does go down an interesting path and I did enjoy my time playing it. It doesn't cost much, so I do recommend it as both a small &quot;collect stuff and achievements&quot; game if you enjoy those and an alternative to a short and probably biased documentary.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22605396', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22605396' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22605396\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22605396' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22605396\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22605396', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22605396_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22605396_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">17 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22259080\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">foofaraw<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/games\/?tab=all\">1,134 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/\">102 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1979 Revolution: Black Friday is, so far, possibly the most significant game I\u2019ve ever encountered. True, I\u2019ve played games like Beeswing, that were profound on a personal level, but this game is profound on global, historical and personal levels. For this reason, and others, it has already drawn hostility purely for political and social reasons, so I feel justified in attempting to redirect attention toward back toward this important and interesting game while attempting to maintain context. (This is a very early review on a game that is impressive from the very start, and that I expect to elaborate on soon.)<br><br>1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a game about the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, to be replaced by religious fundamentalists. That event is very important to those of us that are Americans (regrettably, the only context I have) because this nation was fully responsible for placing the Shah\u2019s oppressive regime in place, with all the repression and CIA-trained torture of dissenting voices involved. The history of the region, the nation and the time are an extremely critical part of the game, but more so are the people of Iran, both those guilty (to many) of instilling yet another oppressive government, and those innocent of anything beyond wanting happiness and a better life for their families. People just like those all over the world.<br><br>One of those innocent characters in 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a young, male photojournalist named Reza Shirazi, who finds himself caught between his Shah-supporting family and his Ayatollah-supporting friends as he attempts to record the street revolt for posterity. And that\u2019s basically the beginning of the game: Reza in a prison cell being tortured by an historical figure for information and connections, as the game proceeds in flashback form.<br><br>Much of 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is caught up in the minutia of the actual proceedings. The events, the people, the places are all (apparently) real, based on personal accounts and news reporting. The story may occasionally seem to bog down in the detailed use of Reza\u2019s camera to record shots matching actual photos of the time, but goes far toward setting a precise, real mood for the player. Each photo taken presents the option to learn the reality behind that person or event, but may be (?) easily avoided on any subsequent playthroughs. When this game is presented as being \u201cbased on choices\u201d, it\u2019s an understatement, since choices have repercussions from small to large, and can come fast and furious. Outside the story itself are 39 Steam achievements based on those choices, included many multi-stage achievements. All indications based on the large number of choices are that this game warrants multiple playthroughs.<br><br>I was an young adult preparing to graduate college at the time of the 1979 Revolution, and I have distinct memories of the kidnapping and release of the American embassy hostages, as well as the resulting Iran-Contra scandal. Few things have shaken faith in government as universally in my lifetime as knowing that a soon-to-be president traded weapons for trusting American lives (as if baseball cards) with the nation considered by many to be our worst enemy (at that time calling us &quot;the great satan&quot;.) And possibly worst of all was that our president (Reagan) left the nation, the hostages, and their families tortured in the ignorance of the illegal deal he had previously (and secretly) made to free them for little reason more than to embarrass the outgoing president, Jimmy Carter. All that is important context to this game being played in the 21st century, but not essential to enjoyment. Perhaps a quick read-through of the following would be helpful before starting 1979 Revolution: Black Friday to have a more complete understanding of the complicated relationship between the people and nations of Iran and the USA from that time until today:<br>  <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iranian_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iranian_Revolution<\/a><br><br>1979 Revolution: Black Friday isn\u2019t for everyone.

The game focuses on the Iranian Revolution, from 1979 that led to the overthrow of the dictatorial regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in Iran. <br><br>The game play is your run of the mill point and click adventure game, but resembles more of a Telltale style environment, where timed dialog choices are prominent throughout the story, as well as quick time events. Thankfully the QTEs are few and far between, allowing you chance to sit back and relax the main element of this game, the gripping story. <br><br>The most important feature of a point and click game is obviously going to be the plot, 1979 Revolution ticks all of the right boxes there. Following a historical timeline of events with slight blurred lines between reality and what you see in the game, we follow Reza and his good friend Babek as they look to exploit the terrorist regime in Iran to start a revolution. You meet important characters along the way and you will develop relationships with them depending on actions and dialog choices throughout. The story takes you through dips, turns and dramatic outcomes, and potentially leaves the plot open for a sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed the story of this game, not only is it an interesting plot, but it teaches you something, which is always an added bonus when it comes to video games. <br><br>Graphically this game looks decent, nothing spectacular, but there are hundreds of worse looking titles out there. It looks like an early GTA title in terms of textures, animations and work environments. Still pleasant to look at, but don\u2019t expect state of the art graphics and clean cut visuals here. The voice acting on the other hand is brilliant, all characters are well voiced and fit their character\u2019s perfectly. This game would not be what it is today without this top notch voice acting. I can\u2019t imagine I would of enjoyed it nearly as much if it was text based. <br><br>There isn\u2019t any difficulty to 1979, The only time you will fail at any point is if you miss a QTE, and then you can simply replay it and pay more attention! While the game does have different choices to take throughout the plot, the ultimate ending will near enough be the same regardless, which is a bit of a shame as I always like it when games clearly make your choices matter. <br><br>It is also worth noting that this game is very short.  The story is spread out across 18 chapters, but this still only took me under an hour to complete. You will find a bit of replayability though due to the different paths you may follow, as well as tons of collectibles and achievements to hunt for as well. For me though, I\u2019m only going to want to play through it once. <br><br>Overall, 1979 is a really good adventure game, but the only thing that lets it down is the lack of content that gives this game any longevity. If the story could be expanded or lead onto maybe an Episode 2, then it would be well worth the \u00a38.99 but purely because it is so short, I can only recommend 1979 Revolution: Black Friday when it is on sale. <br><br><b><u> Tom's Score Card<\/u><\/b><br>1) Stay away<br>2) Not Recommended<br><b><u>3) Only recommended when on sale<\/u><\/b><br>4) Recommended<br>5) Highly recommended<br>6) This is a must play<br><br>If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It is very close to that of the Telltale game series. <br><br>the mix of choices, QTE, and Photography, Exploration all blend well together. The strength coming from having the real life pictures next to the one\u2019s you took. I found myself meticulously trying to recreate all the photographs to the originals. Photos also provide a means to learn about the actual events, culture, and people that influenced the Revolution. By the way, there is a tremendous amount of content in this game in regards to learning about the revolution, history, and culture of Iran. This is where the games stands apart from pretty much anything. the voice acting in the game, are as good as any AAA title. With an extremely talented cast of Iranian actors the really bring it on the performance front. All the sounds from the environments are great as well, and really bring you to Tehran.<br><br>The developer claims the plot is based on a real story. The protagonist, Reza, is from a wealthy family. He studied abroad in Germany. When he came back to Iran, he almost came across the ongoing revolution by accident. Iran was not it once was anymore. After seeing what he saw, he decided to participate in it. Whereas, his involvement troubled him with countless dilemmas, compelling him to pick sides. On one hand there is his brother, on the other are his friends and cousin. You choices affect how the game progresses. Walking on the street, you feel as if you are living through the revolution yourself. Seeing people protesting and suffering, you are compelled to feel sympathetic towards them. The political figures in this game are entirely real. When I was the graffiti of Khomeini on the street, I was like &quot;Oh my God!&quot; and my heart was beating so fast. This game does not pick a political side nor try to preach you liberal democracy. Instead, it tells you the paradox and contradiction existed in the revolution, making the choices hard to make. Ideal is idealistic because it is not reality. The moment when you threw the stone, it changed you forever. Is violence necessary? Is family more important than ideal? Is life more important than freedom? There's no good guy or bad guy in this game, it's all perspective.<br><br>If you're a fan of TellTale games, you'll enjoy this...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22463900', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22463900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22463900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22463900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22463900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22463900', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22463900_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22463900_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28150336\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"109154873\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67a49ad8d569963503dce7c6e43d9bfe54dd5d62.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67a49ad8d569963503dce7c6e43d9bfe54dd5d62.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67a49ad8d569963503dce7c6e43d9bfe54dd5d62_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/\" data-miniprofile=\"109154873\">\u266bQuilly Shiba (Greenlight)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/games\/?tab=all\">5,646 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/recommended\/\">40 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/littlequillybunny\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Overview<\/div>I played through an ending and tried one or two branches, in 6 hours. I didn't get to additional major endings, but have read that there are different endings. I found this game's story immersive and gripping, and the art quite good, though there were some small gripes I had with the walking speed and handling.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Immersive story and historical depiction, great characters<\/div>My favourite part about this game is the story. It plays like a Telltale game, with choice selection by your character in many intense situations as the story progresses. What you do affects the people around you and potential results of major events. The story is based on true events, and I really found this way of learning about historical events very immersive. Walking around in the streets you can check out the local foods, listen to local radio... it was kind of a virtual cultural tour for me. I recall finding a magazine or cassette (I forgot exactly what) featuring the legendary singer Googoosh, which one of my close friends who is Persian, has often fondly talked about. This small detail in the game really had an emotional impact on me, because when I heard about this old singer in my real life I was kind of interested but didn't understand the context in which she was famous. Seeing a mention of her in the game however, as people yelled and screamed, and gunshots were ringing throughout the marketplace, really put into context how influential these cultural artifacts are and I felt like it was something I could relate to after playing the game. Definitely I really enjoyed learning about the history and culture from a game perspective, and look forward to more games like this.<br><br>One other thing that stuck out to me were the characters, I found all the main characters quite interesting and could sympathize\/ empathize with them, and you get to learn about the main character's family and how differing political opinions, especially in a revolution with heavy political consequences, can tear apart a family though they still love each other. This historical event really has torn apart many people's relations yet you can empathize with how strong human emotions can be, under these intense circumstances.<br><br>A small gripe was the walking handling by which I mean that sometimes the camera would move in strange ways and the walking speed wouldn't match up. Just a small thing which irritated me a couple times but wouldn't really affect the whole story in a major way.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div>Overall I recommend this game for the superb characters and cultural immersion. Do keep in mind that it will probably last around 5~8 hours, which depending on you could be short or the perfect length.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28150336', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28150336' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28150336\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28150336' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28150336\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28150336', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28150336_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28150336_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t60 of 81 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22327510\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/federicogonzaga\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"88855040\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cd5817934fa3c4f0c9cda8e6ec91d214554a54c1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cd5817934fa3c4f0c9cda8e6ec91d214554a54c1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cd5817934fa3c4f0c9cda8e6ec91d214554a54c1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/federicogonzaga\/\" data-miniprofile=\"88855040\">Earl of Trollbridge<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/federicogonzaga\/games\/?tab=all\">636 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/federicogonzaga\/recommended\/\">25 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/federicogonzaga\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs someone who study history professionally, I sometimes do not like some mainstream historical games that are eurocentric and politicized.

Instead, it tells you the paradox and contradiction existed in the revolution, making the choices hard to make. Ideal is idealistic because it is not reality. The moment when you threw the stone, it changed you forever. Is violence necessary? Is family more important than ideal? Is life more important than freedom? Would you sacrifice the 1\/3 for the other 2\/3? You are the one to answer these questions that we are still unable to answer today.<br><br>I feel I can relate to this game so much. I also come from a wealthy family. My parents also lived through a different revolution. I am also idealistic yet realistic. My ideal betrays my spectrum but I feel it is right. My reality does not allow me to follow my ideal if I were to keep my status. I believe in democracy yet I see authoritarianism as a highly efficient system. I love my family yet I want to pursue my ideal. <br><br>I think we all are Reza. We are all as contradictory as the choices we make in this game. <br><br>What a game!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22327510', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22327510' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22327510\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22327510' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22327510\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22327510', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22327510_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22327510_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22872751\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084364799\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"124099071\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e4bcce7a025e481479c193982cc418885fbada3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e4bcce7a025e481479c193982cc418885fbada3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e4bcce7a025e481479c193982cc418885fbada3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084364799\/\" data-miniprofile=\"124099071\">Paul Vitti<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084364799\/games\/?tab=all\">33 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084364799\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198084364799\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm not Iranian, but I have read pretty much about Iran and the Revolution in 1979.<br><br>In the game, the reasons behind the Revolution are very well emphasized.

And the end actually makes you think there's sequels\/DLC episodes. <br><br>I gotta admit, the 1979 Iran Revolution is as bloody as it could be, and it lectured me what a revolution looks like. It's pretty cool on the idea. <br><br>Problem with the game is low budget, thus there are lots of flaws. <br><br>If the budget was high, I think the game would come out a dominant narrative-driven game. The world settings and characters, everything is inherently rich, they just need more exploitation. <br><br>This game lacks polishing of course, but the story and the world background is cool. And hence the price is low, I'd give it a 6\/10. Graphics in this game is actually not that important.<br><br>The voice acting is pretty good, character development is good also. And the relationship between our main chracters is just so contradictory simultaneously tempting. <br><br>The next episode is probably, <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Reza got escaped and finished his love story with Bibi. And dipicting the whole landscape under the revolution of Iran.<\/span><\/span><br><br>Suggestion: not most of us know what 1979 Iran Revolution is so there's not much context for us, so studio might want to do a recap video for simply introducing the whole event to the new comers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30065286', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30065286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30065286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30065286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30065286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30065286', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30065286_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30065286_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30051437\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BazBake\/recommended\/388320\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"16502041\">BazBake<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDrew me in very deeply into a part of history I've thought about but had never considered with the texture on display here.

You do so mainly by interacting with the environment, NPC's and in particular by taking pictures with the camera Reza always carries with him, by which you'll be provided with additional information regarding the people of Iran and key players\/events of that time. <br><br>Despite its short length and thus limited information on some subjects, 1979 Revolution: Black Friday largely succeeds at storytelling and neither needs to hide itself from or even avoid its competitors - on the contrary, the weight of the subject matter and how they handled it is elevating videogames in general to a level where their relevance in today's society and how they have matured truly has to be recognized - but it unfortunately doesn't do that well in the gameplay department. Minor bugs and things like a sometimes too small and narrow window, in which you have to react and decide in which manner you want to handle the situation presented to you, tend to pull you out of the otherwise great immersion this game creates and hinders one at reflecting over the moral ambiguity such conflicts often inherit.<br><br>Nonetheless is 1979 Revolution: Black Friday a game I can wholeheartedly recommend, not only to those particularly interested in the subject at hand, but to anyone who likes to question and wants to broaden their horizon... and what better way is there to start while playing a videogame?<br> <br>Well, if this game in the end accomplishes what it wants or fails due to the complexity of the topic is nothing I wanna judge over and since there's never an easy answer, no simple black or white, I wanna end on a quote that buzzed through my head while playing this truly unique presentation of these somehow almost seemingly forgotten historical events:<br><br>&quot;Power is not a means, it is an end.
