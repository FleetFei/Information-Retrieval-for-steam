Luckily for newbies to the genre like me there is a lovely hint system to help progress through the story. That is countered by the fact you have several different difficulty levels and a custom difficulty too!<br><br>So yes, this game is indeed a point and click, hidden object adventure game (as you probably guessed or if you're a veteran in the games you already know) - The video attached contains my first 30 minutes of playing through the game. It is uncut so what you see is what you get, I use my knowledge and explain through the options and then take the main game as it comes.<br><br>I would recommend this game to anyone who indeed loves the hidden object point and click games but the only problem for me is the NPC's animations of their head when they speak (as you will see in the video above). I would also recommend it to newcomers wanting to get into the genre (like me) as I have a genuine interest in point and clicks, I just need to learn more patience.<br><br>I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is new to the genre and has low patience or are seeking adrenaline blood pumping action because unfortunately you wont get it with this game. I did however get a buzz when I did solve the puzzles correctly (rarely).<br><br>If I need to add anything to this or you have any questions please let me know! :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18993346', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18993346' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18993346\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18993346' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18993346\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18993346', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18993346_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18993346_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22179158\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">Vic=HKC=<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/games\/?tab=all\">2,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/\">343 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/413470\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe cardinal has a mission for you: stop the terror by the hand of an inquisitor in a remote village in Spain. Many innocents people died and it's time for you to understand why he's so interested in an old woman, Miguela. But nothing is easy in that cold town, where the sun never shows itself and where old feuds are strong in the heart of those who fell to hate.<br><br>If you played Where Angels Cry, you take back the role of the monk investigating his own brothers (well, in the church, not his own family) that seemed to have lost themselves to whatever vicious feeling they're currently having. However, now, the story is way more elaborated than the first game and is more polished. However, the ending isn't really satisfying. It cuts abruptly and you can only speculate. Even the bonus chapter isn't explaining it, it's more a prequel and an explanation of how the things came to be.<br><br>Now, the game is more oriented towards an hidden object setting, as you have scenes of them, that are easy and interesting. Even if Where Angels Cry is standard in this field (find items, use them and solve puzzles), it's more satisfying than in the previous game. Puzzles are easy and well explained. However, there is a major problem: you're often lost at what to do. Even in Casual, with the map showing the actions you need to do, you're asking yourself what you're missing. I got stuck in Ramon's house because the area that I needed wasn't clear. It's just a little disappointment given the great improvement of the game.<br><br>And the game improved also in terms of graphics: they're better: the characters seem more alive than in the first game, despite being in a winter decorum, the backgrounds are quite cheerful and colorful, in other words, it seems less outdated. The soundtrack also improved and was way more fitting into the story. However, better graphics don't mean that you can put everything in an hidden object game. I was under the impression sometimes that items were not medieval at all, despite the game being in the 13th century.<br><br>Where Angels Cry: Tears of the Fallen is a very good surprise, especially if you played the first game. Everything improved greatly, even if there are still some little problems. However, I've been more &quot;active&quot; in this opus than the first one. The price is perhaps a little high, even if it's a collector's edition, however, it's still a worthy purchase. If you played Where Angels Cry, I urge you to try Tears of the Fallen, so that you don't stay on your impression of the first game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22179158', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22179158' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22179158\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22179158' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22179158\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22179158', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22179158_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22179158_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/413470\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["18993346","22179158"]}
