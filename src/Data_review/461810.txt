With the Cafe 0 waiter Noir, Corliss is sent back to the living to uncover pieces of her past, discover more about herself and the mystery surrounding the Ashford family and eventually find peace in her journey after death which is unavoidable and will always occur within 7 days at the time of returning back to the living world. At the Ashford villa, Corliss is introduced to two members of the Ashford family Ethan Ashford and Nathan Ashford and the family butler Barclay. As Corliss attempts to find out more about her past through each character, she will return to Cafe 0 and back to the living again, reliving the same 7 days prior to her death with additional hints and past memories before eventually choosing an ending without returning to Cafe 0 in a tale of mystery, intrigue, subterfuge, fertility, love, honour, jealousy, duty, loyalty, superstition, witch-hunting, betrayal and vengeance.<br><br>The game has plenty of save slots to allow different gameplay and dialogue choices to be made during the game, with a different coloured heart(black, blue, green or red) or gold gear popup icon to reach a different storyline branch and the option to skip and fast-forward any part of the game. Soundtracks and overall game presentation are good after factoring in theme song with vocals. Recommended when game with theme song and soundtrack DLC are at discount or in bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to unlock all past memories, reach all endings and unlock all CGs and achievements.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30609144', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30609144' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30609144\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30609144' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30609144\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30609144', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30609144_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30609144_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30177818\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e6cae187c82d76fbecc15326144f6a33f04e4d8f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/\" data-miniprofile=\"179062502\">Faudraline<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/games\/?tab=all\">1,610 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Faudraline\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god. - Aristotle<\/b><br><br><i>CAFE 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~<\/i> is RoseVeRte's latest visual novel and the second game in CAFE 0 series so far. Comparing this newest installation to the previous one, it should be an obvious conclusion that RoseVeRte came a long way in five years and acquired a significant achievement in producing <i>CAFE 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~<\/i>. Following the same concept in a different story, this sequel presents a similar supernatural mystery with astonishing depth this time.<br><br>Our protagonist and the one to find her way to the strange CAFE 0 after her death is Corliss Green now. She is a young girl who has been working as a maid in the Ashford Mansion, residing on countryside near a village, for a week before her death. Apparently, Corliss came to the village to find her aunt Sophie Evans to fulfill her mother\u2019s dying wish, who was missing for 15 years now and was offered a position as a maid by the household butler of Ashfords, Mr. Barclay. Being the stoic, apathetic woman she was, Corliss accepted the position without a thought since she had nothing else to do around. Apparently, she was always better at following someone else\u2019s orders rather than deciding for her own. When she ends up at the cafe, she is greeted by Noir - another waiter equal in rudeness to Sui, yet less creepier, much scarier I'd say - and informed that she is to relive the last 7 days of her life before choosing a new destination for her afterlife. Oblivious and somewhat insentient to the events of her past and the true story of her aunt's disappearance at first, Corliss is forcefully sent back by Noir. Now she is expected to make choices, relive the week and discover her true self by learning certain emotions. While doing so she will also collect various information concerning the past and the current inhabitant of the mansion to shed some light to the case of the Sleeping Beast.<br><br>The narrative quality and the event flow in the game are spectacularly good. All characters are fleshed out, with layered personalities, traumas, expectations, personal needs and distinct attitudes. It has been a delight to watch different characters in different probabilities and interactions. I'll state this directly: there are no stereotypes in this game. Every single one of the characters involved are presented with depth, nature and demeanor worthy of a Victorian novel. The whole idea of living through the same time interval affected by different choices and results is a beautifully used narrative tool here. This way, developer also manages to gather all different playthroughs into a single story, establishing a neat narrative consistency, which is a rarely achieved feat in this genre. Watching Corliss to discover about different emotions and grow as a character was a sorrowful delight. The mystery itself and the whole setting is a deeply melancholic one, so if you'd prefer cheerier stories, this might not be your cup of tea. Be warned about probable heartbreak and disturbing insight into human nature. But I know that I appreciated it all.<br><br>Did someone said artwork? Well, CGs are not various, but the ones that we are presented with are top-notch. I know I'd love to see Ethan, Nathan and Corliss in more CG artworks but hey, I'm not complaining. Compared to the previous installation, <i>CAFE 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~<\/i> displays a magnificent growth in artwork department. Also, the game soundtrack prepared by Yuang Chen and performed by The Seycara Orchestra is a complete delight, fitting for a glorious anime OVA even.<br><br>Gameplay itself is somewhere between a choice option VN and a kinetic VN since the choices that we have here around are not various, yet their results reinvent the storyline so massively, you don't get to be bored of reading it. For the first three days, you'll have some choice options, which will effectively make you end up in one of the 4 paths. After that point, you'll just sit back and watch the path itself unfold. In each of these paths, you'll be collecting &quot;hints&quot; through your conversations with the inhabitants of the house. At the end of the day, Noir will use that hint to show you a fragment of the events concerning your aunt 15 years ago. After completing all 4 playthroughs and starting a new game, you'll get the opportunity to play the &quot;true path&quot; to solve the mystery of your death and the mystery of the Sleeping Beast once and for all.<br><br>Would I recommend it? That is a definite &quot;YES&quot; coming from me. What we have here is a visual novel well-done with all its mechanics, artwork, narrative functions and setting development. Go ahead. This will be a impressive journey!<br><br>Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/ladystoryteller#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a> - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30177818', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30177818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30177818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30177818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30177818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30177818', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30177818_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30177818_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26578374\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"65065817\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a4ad87ba0a2fc7d6ab16f1715a142334e61b7e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a4ad87ba0a2fc7d6ab16f1715a142334e61b7e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a4ad87ba0a2fc7d6ab16f1715a142334e61b7e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/\" data-miniprofile=\"65065817\">Staraphel<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/games\/?tab=all\">2,357 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Saraphel\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received CAFE 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~ for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCaf\u00e9 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~ is a melancholic, mystery otome game with a playtime of approx. 10 hours (I betatested this game outside of Steam, so that's why my playtime is just 4 hours). It is very intriguing and has an overall mystery that's hinted at in every single route, which is finally unveiled in the True Route.<br>The characters are interesting and the music is to die for, not to mention the past is dragged directly into the story, thanks to a clever hint system which I'm personally very fond of. The Japanese voice acting is great as well (go, Eva!) and makes the characters come alive.<br><br>It deals with loneliness, identity, love, death, loss, and many other themes, so it's very melancholic in spirit and left me affected for quite a while afterwards. While many would consider the playtime low for the price, the production quality is high, and the game is miles ahead of its predecessor, The Drowned Mermaid.<br>If you dig mystery and melancholy, you should definitely consider buying it!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26578374', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26578374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26578374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26578374' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26578374\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26578374', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26578374_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26578374_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary27702626\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amaicherii\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"259749061\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d58832860980015817de4815d45e2adff888e05a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d58832860980015817de4815d45e2adff888e05a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d58832860980015817de4815d45e2adff888e05a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amaicherii\/\" data-miniprofile=\"259749061\">amaicherii<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amaicherii\/games\/?tab=all\">32 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amaicherii\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/amaicherii\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is definitely Roseverte's best game so far, and I will tell you why.<br><br>First of all, I'd like to say this visual novel isn't really an otome game; rather, it's a mystery game heavily focused on love. But what is love? Love is not only romantic, there are different types of love (such as family love, frienship love, etc) and THIS is what I'm talking about. Cafe 0 ~The Sleeping Beast~ is a game about love.<br><br>You play as Corliss, a maid hired to work for the Ashfords, a noble family living in a modest village. Unfortunately, Corliss is dead by the start of the game and arrives at Cafe 0, a place where &quot;lost souls&quot; gather when they don't know where to go after death (it reminded me of a sort of limbo). Here, she meets the grouchy waiter Noir, who tells her he'll send her 7 days prior to her death so that she can find out why she died...or could there also be something more? Of course there is, it's a mystery game after all ;D <br><br>The game has a total of 5 routes; 4 of them are for the Ashford twins (2 for Nathan and 2 for Ethan) and the remaining one is the true route, which is unlocked after you finish the other 4. Personally, I recommend this order of playthrough:<br><br>1) Nathan Family route<br>2) Nathan Friendship route<br>3) Ethan Couple route<br>4) Ethan Partner route<br>5) True route<br><br>Wait, what? Couple? Is this an otome? Well, although there is a route focused on romantic love, remember what I mentioned at the beginning of this review: Cafe 0 is a game about different types of love. Corliss is, how should we put it? A doll-like person, she's not what some people would describe as a 'kuudere'; rather, she's empty and only does as she's told. It's thanks to her interactions with the twins that she'll discover different feelings along the way (or along the routes haha) and, therefore, grow as a person and find herself. <br><br>Some may think Corliss could be boring because she &quot;doesn't feel anything&quot; but NO, ladies and gentlemen, Corliss is a GREAT heroine who will also make you laugh several times due to her bluntness and, as she starts developing different types of feelings, she'll warm your heart. Then, of course, how can we forget the twins? Nathan, the tsundere yet kind boy and Ethan, the cheerful yet mysterious boy. I don't want to spoil anything because it's really a much better experience if you found out for yourself just how charming and loveable these 2 are. <br><br>There are also other characters which will make an appearance in the past; this is due to Noir's power, but only when you find a HINT. Another reason why I recommend to play Nathan's routes first is not only because they have the least spoilers,  but also because the game gradually gets darker and darker...and I'll leave it at that. <br><br>So, to conclude, what are this game's pros and cons?<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Beautiful art and GUI<br><br>-Excellent OST (the developer is thinking of selling it, yay!)<br><br>-Great story with lots of mystery and twists, but also heartwarming and funny moments<br><br>-Great dialogue<br><br>-There are very little repeated conversations, and they actually function as a sort of bookmark to the story<br><br>-Amazing characters (especially Corliss and the twins)<br><br>-Incredible japanese voice acting<br><br>-If you leave the default name 'Corliss', the characters will call her by her name &lt;3 (like in certain otome games)<br><br>-You can easily go to the menu with just a right click on the mouse<br><br><br>Cons:<br><br>-The descriptions are not as good as the dialogue; many words such as &quot;suddenly&quot; are repeated plus there are certain phrases which are too commonplace (for example, the typical 'tears rolled down my cheeks')<br><br>-This is not really a con but the birthday scene only changes on the true route, which is ok but I would have liked to see a little more variation of this scene on the other routes as well<br><br>-This is just personal preference so you can ignore it if you don't agree but, having played a wide variety of visual novels, I've really grown accustomed to skip buttons being on the textbox. It's true that some of them are quite big and, therefore, cover a bit of the screen, but I've seen many visual novels (particularly otome games) where the skip button was small and convenient<br><br><br>So, in the end, do I recommend this game? Of course I recommend it! It's a must play!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27702626', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27702626' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27702626\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27702626' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27702626\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27702626', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27702626_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27702626_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26577953\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198189711149\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"229445421\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b90c0f5cd5967159b446150a45309670f2f1f8dc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b90c0f5cd5967159b446150a45309670f2f1f8dc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b90c0f5cd5967159b446150a45309670f2f1f8dc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198189711149\/\" data-miniprofile=\"229445421\">Yukio<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198189711149\/games\/?tab=all\">17 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198189711149\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198189711149\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is my first time writing a review, so sorry in advance if this is really one sided opinion. Remember this is only my personal opinion! <br><br>I have found most of roseVeRte's games verry appealing so far and this game haven't disapointed me thus far. I don't have much that this review is based on cause I have only played Nathan's friend route, the demo an a few thing I saw the the developer write on Twitter and Tumblr so I write based on that for now, but I might change this review later on. So far I find the characters appealing in both the personality the writer have given them and the art\/ character designs itself. I like how the MC is kind of like a doll in the beginning, but changes after interacting more with the other characters. Nathan's is so cute with his blushy faces. (almost tsundere if anything)\u30fd(\uff0a&gt;\u2207&lt;)\uff89 Not going to say more about Nathan's, cause it might be spoilers, but you can really see both the MC and Nathan's development as you play. I found the friend ending a bit sad and i was almost in tears near the end. (\/ \u0434\uff1b ) It deffinitely tuched my heart in a sad but good way. That's might be given cause one of themes of the game is death. I find the writing great, but it looks like roseVeRte decided to focus more on the mystery in it self rather then the interactions with the characters. It isn't a bad thing if you came for the mystery and it still got a few great interactions despite that! The game also have a bit of comedy or funny senes or interactions. This game is not exacly an Otoge, but it got Otome or romance elements even though that's not the focus. I also like the fact that a bit of the truth behind the mystery is hinted in in every route so you can guess what is to come and kind of colled pices and put them together and you also get 3 truth ends that i have yet to play. But this game makes one stay curious in my opinion and want to play to find out what happens next and is so long that you have to wait too long to get the pices together and might lose interest along the way. So i find it good that it's not long considering that. I personaly like short or not too long VN's because of that reson. The voice actors did a great jobb with the voice acting and i simpely loved the soundtracks it fit well with the situations. So I'm personaly verry satisfied with the game thus far and don't have complaints or anything negativ too say so far. So I want to give this game and the developer and cast a big thumbs up. (*\uff3e-\u2019) \u4e43<br><br>It might not be long and some people might find the game expensive word count wise, but quality wise the game is deffinitely worth it and you should definitely give it a try. The game is not a tragedy exactely, but if you want something that can tuch or mess your feelings depending on haw emotional you are i would recomend this ride of feels lol (*\uff3e\u2200\uff9f)\u044a. But with all jokes aside I would recommend the game to thouse of you that like mystery, VN, Otoge, something that's not too long, want to play something different for a change of peace or if you would like to play something that can touch your feelings. If it's important for you that this is an complete otoge this might not be for you and both girls and guys should try this cause it does not look like it's targeting a specific gender specific even though some people might argu that it's for girls. And if yor not sure if you want to play it or not you can always try the demo first and see for yourself if it catces your interest, but the developer did say that the demo is short to leave out spoilers so you might not get enough impressions to decide if you want to give it a try but I hope It does. Too bad it's not longer, but I can understad more or less why the roseVeRte decided to do so. Leaving this aside I can't wait to play the rest of the game~ (\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301)\u0648 \u0311\u0311\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26577953', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26577953' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26577953\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26577953' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26577953\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26577953', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26577953_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26577953_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26733591\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shinyasenpai\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"339389863\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3c\/3cedf2c19f2f16af01d415d00f5cf69b4905a776.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3c\/3cedf2c19f2f16af01d415d00f5cf69b4905a776.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3c\/3cedf2c19f2f16af01d415d00f5cf69b4905a776_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shinyasenpai\/\" data-miniprofile=\"339389863\">shinyasenpai<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shinyasenpai\/games\/?tab=all\">17 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shinyasenpai\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shinyasenpai\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Everything is entirely my opinion-<br><br>This game is better than The Drowned Mermaid in that there is not as much repeated conversations. There are hints in every day and it is very interesting to see them fall into place with your suspicions confirmed. If I were to play this game alone, I might not have realised it's by an indie game developer. <br><br>The plot, characters are really good, a lot better than the Drowned Mermaid, and most of the OST really suits the atmosphere of the situation. The characters were also portrayed well with the great voice acting.<br><br>Again, my praise for this game could be because I did not expect to see such quality from an indie group - especially in the character voices and the design. In my opinion, I am extremely glad to have bought it so I can replay it.<br><br>See you again in Cafe 0.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26733591', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26733591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26733591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26733591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26733591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26733591', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26733591_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26733591_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28213950\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SillyGoofBallManiac\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"123098909\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SillyGoofBallManiac\/\" data-miniprofile=\"123098909\">SillyGoofBallManiac<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SillyGoofBallManiac\/games\/?tab=all\">3 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SillyGoofBallManiac\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SillyGoofBallManiac\/recommended\/461810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just finished this intriguing mystery novel. If you are into a twisted tale filled with all kinds of emotions which will leave you surprised, and interested for more than I suggest you give this game a try. This was a well thought out and original story. You start to enjoy the characters and you learn a lot about their past and how that past shaped them up to be into complicated people. Everyone in the game has secrets to hide from each other which leads to a lot of tension between everyone. It's like everyone is against each other or so you think.
