And what can I say? I enjoyed this game more than I expected, even tho there are a few problems (at least in my opinion, I\u2019m no \u201cgame expert\u201d. But those were things that I\u2019ve felt while playing it, so I want to talk about them as well).<br><br><b>The story:<\/b> It was good, above average honestly. Ain\u2019t no masterpiece, but I definitely enjoyed! The only thing that kinda disappointed me was the little twist in the end. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>If it was only Fuyuka\u2019s doing, I\u2019d have love it. But inserting the other guy was kinda\u2026 too much? I don\u2019t know how to explain. It kinda broke the whole brotherly vibe somehow, at least for me)<\/span><\/span> I also enjoyed the multiple endings and how just one or two different choices can change everything. Also, I have an undying love for family stories, especially when they have to be more united than ever to face their difficulties. Break Chance Memento was perfect for me on that aspect.<br><br><b>The brothers:<\/b> Shuuki was an okay MC. It\u2019s weird because sometimes he says something but then he acts completely different from his \u201cnormal\u201d behavior, especially on the two romantic routes. I understand that he\u2019s changing, growing up. But sometimes I found hard to believe that he was \u201cthe man who could have anyone he wanted\u201d. Overall, I liked him and I found myself feeling sad when I read about his true feelings towards the accident. His brothers, Natsume (special angel cake sent from the heavens by the way) and Masaharu were good characters too. I loved their relationship, the family love feeling was pretty intense. Those brothers just deserve to be happy.<br><br><b>Romantic routes:<\/b> Well, to be totally honest, I only enjoyed one of them: Chiaki\u2019s. He\u2019s a good guy, and his relation with Shuuki was cute. They make a good couple. But Yukinari\u2019s route made no sense to me. Yes, he\u2019s cute, but\u2026 just that?? I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t feel that Shuuki and him were close to the point of dating. It was actually awkward. No offense to the developers, but I felt like Yukinari was \u201cthrown\u201d in the story, with little personality development. <br><br><b>Gameplay:<\/b> There\u2019s actually some gameplay here! You need to find clues (more like the \u201cmementos\u201d) in order to keep going with the story. Since I enjoy hidden objects games, I liked this aspect of BCM. Also, there\u2019s a lot of special scenes to unlock with each memento. A bit hard to achieve, but satisfying as hell once you do it.<br><br>8\/10. Even with the problems I listed above, I still think this game was good. <b>If you enjoy family\/brother stories like I do, you\u2019re going to like it.<\/b> But if you only came here for the BL, you might get disappointed.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30843797', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30843797' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30843797\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30843797' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30843797\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30843797', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30843797_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30843797_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21168104\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051442784\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"91177056\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e944d1240c6453505bd7f4b1632febb3dcff014.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e944d1240c6453505bd7f4b1632febb3dcff014.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1e\/1e944d1240c6453505bd7f4b1632febb3dcff014_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051442784\/\" data-miniprofile=\"91177056\">Hanged Hourai<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051442784\/games\/?tab=all\">368 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051442784\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198051442784\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">44.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo preface this review, I should mention that I was a beta tester for the game and have been able to follow it through its development. With that said, I can offer an honest review of the game.<br><br>tl;dr The game is great. The amount of content, quality of writing and artwork, along with an engaging story makes it easily a great game to pick up if you enjoy the genre or a good story.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Playtime\/Length<\/div>There is so much content in this game that your first playthrough will take you about 5-6 hours to get through alone. And with several routes to choose from, getting through all the main content will be thoroughly engaging and get you so much value for what you put into the game. I think a good way I\u2019ve heard a way to describe the amount of writing in BCM is that its total length is about 3.5 Great Gatsby\u2019s long. The game is filled with content. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Music<\/div>The music is open source, but it is used very well. The choice of song for any given situation is fitting and matches the ambiance of a scene. With a soundtrack of 33 songs, you will find a great amount of distinction between songs and it lends itself to framing a scene just right when you hear the fitting background music.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Visuals<\/div>The artwork in the game is all stunning. From expressive character art to CG\u2019s to backgrounds, the game certainly isn\u2019t lacking when it comes to its visuals. BCM has gone through several visual updates during its development and the finished product shows how polished it is as a result. The user interface is sleek and appealing, fitting to the game itself. All art assets are incredibly done, deserving of high praise. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Writing\/Gameplay<\/div>I\u2019m not very good with words myself, so I probably won\u2019t do it justice when I say the writing is extremely well-done and high quality. The cast of the game avoids common archetypes and each person feels separate, yet complete in their characterization. You will undoubtedly find favorites and traits you love about each character since they reflect real people so well. The story flows fluidly and smoothly. Reading it is first and foremost, enjoyable. I could take my time to appreciate the details as well as things like the character development. Before you know it, it becomes engaging and gripping. Writing of this caliber is something more people should treat themselves to. <br><br>An important part of a visual novel such as this are the choices that are presented to the reader. Immediately, you can tell that choices matter and they make sense. You won\u2019t ever find something arbitrary as deciding to go left or right and that making the story change on its head. Your actions have very reasonable, realistic consequences, which is something I think more works in this genre could adapt. <br><br>I\u2019ll fill in more details later, but do yourself a favor and get the game. It really is well-done in every aspect and it\u2019s one of the best stories I\u2019ve had the pleasure to read.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21168104', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21168104' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21168104\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21168104' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21168104\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21168104', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21168104_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21168104_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21306524\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"162281692\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54ee8ca0067f3379ec1f2b359e65aeb62b611a08.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54ee8ca0067f3379ec1f2b359e65aeb62b611a08.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/54ee8ca0067f3379ec1f2b359e65aeb62b611a08_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/\" data-miniprofile=\"162281692\">cenilec<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/games\/?tab=all\">114 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198122547420\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI ... I can't say that I fully understand every minor detail of what's going on in this game, even after playing through the whole thing multiple times. Might be tiny plot holes, might be my own stupidity, but nevertheless I'm not bothered by it in any way.<br><br>The story, the characters and the art style are brilliant. And while it might not be a romance focused game (although there's a lot of that too), it's definitely relationship and character developement focused. It's supported by a great story, but what ultimately got me hooked for hours were the relationships between the various characters. Every single character feels like a real person you can easily get attached to. My first playthrough took me around 6 hours, but it left me wanting to see everything the game has to offer. And yes, it got me to spend 4 hours trying to get Yuki's ending. Yes, I can see that by looking at the time of my achievements. 4 hours. <br><br>I can only recommend this to everyone, and especially if you're into Visual Novels and \/ or relationship focused stories.

A bit complicated though, which is nice. Though it feels there are small, super tiny plot holes. But barely visible, if you do not focus on them, are they invisible. But it was something that gnawed in my mind, not much since everything else was dazzeling. The story as whole was amazing, and well thougt anyway!!  I really liked it, it was awesome and intressting!<br> Its a bit tricky to get all the endings, but its still easy to solve too in the end. Also that there is a lot one can experience in it! To look around to find and see! A lot of scenes to get between Shuuki and the others, due to different requirements and mementos. That makes it replayable, though, the beginning gets a little bit tiring if you want a specific endig and fail, and then you have to go throug it again. Luckly there is a skip button, and it stops when a new scene occour, so you wont miss anything. <br>The writing is easy to follow and do not use many difficult words, and it still  manage to sound clever and pretty in the language, as it paints the situation in a simple, understandable way. But some sentences could have some rephrasing, but they are very, very few. And some things gets repeated,  its not often, and does not stand that much in the way either. Since the overall text is, as mentioned, well written. <br>The art is very pretty!!!! The shading is nice and smoot, and the lightning really highligts their details in a gorgeous way, like Shuukis hair. &lt;3  And Shuuki is almost irritating pretty (in a good way), since my brain could almost not comprehend it, haha ,long wonderful hair &lt;3 and I just stared at how pretty drawn he was. The colouring is beautiful everywhere! From the characters to their surrounding! The bakgrounds are also well drawn! I really like the style the artist have!<br>The characters are deep in personality, and nice &lt;3 I like all of them &lt;3. And they speak in a natural way, not forced or anything. And they can say really funny things to one other. xD And act in different ways, yet very caring. Also following Shuuki's personal change is nice! <br>The music is good, but I did not always pay attetion to it, it does not stuck in my mind or anything. It just nice for the moment. At times I listened, then it vanish from my thoughts, even if the music is still played in the game, it lost is grip. ( Can also be that I was mesmerized by Shuuki... haha. )<br>Best of all ( In my opinion ), its boy x boy!!!! I have not seen this sort of VN on steam before! I have only seen Girl x Girl, and wondered, is there some VN with BL here on steam? Well here is one! And its awesome! They do not show anything, except for kiss scenes. And the relationships goes in a good pace. And can be very cute. If that is not your suit, then you do not need to pursue anyone! ( But you wont get all the endings if you avoid it. ) <br><br>10\/10, is my say in this. I do recommend this! For its story, art, and .. BL, heee. &lt;3\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21304794', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21304794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21304794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21304794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21304794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21304794', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21304794_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21304794_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28778562\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vidservent\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"287081394\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e1ca9352172242b714fa4ef715d4bb24a2cf2a5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e1ca9352172242b714fa4ef715d4bb24a2cf2a5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e1ca9352172242b714fa4ef715d4bb24a2cf2a5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vidservent\/\" data-miniprofile=\"287081394\">Vidservent<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vidservent\/games\/?tab=all\">124 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vidservent\/recommended\/\">49 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vidservent\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA game where the protagonist is Bi but romance isn't the focus of the story lol besides only 2 out of 4 character routes are romance routes where the other 2 are sibling routes. You can still get a normal end if you don't specifically pursue someone.<br>Anyway the whole time travel gameplay is pretty unique and kind of like a hidden object game but an overly easy one at that.

On Steam I think I've only logged a few hours in BCM, but between testing previous patches and playing the itch.io build prior to its Steam release, I've logged 40+ hours of play and I'm still looking forward to more.<br><br>So!  With that said, if you're looking for a thorough, exhaustive review of BCM's strengths and weaknesses as a visual novel, Hanged Hourai's got you covered.  <br><br>For my part, I\u2019ll talk about BCM\u2019s synergy between tight character writing and emotive character sprite design, because the characters really make this game something special.<br><br>Between the Amamiya brothers and the friends that orbit their complex familial dynamic, BCM presents people that are at once familiar in archetype and refreshingly unique in execution. The script is deceptive in its simplicity because BCM is a VN that doesn't outright demand more energy than you're used to committing to the genre. Character interactions are charmingly relaxing right up until they\u2019re not. And while the game is built on the drama of death and time travel, it's the quieter moments that had me sobbing.  <br><br>Each character receives defining moments that reveal their three-dimensionality.  But it wasn't until much later that I realized I'd fallen in love with each one long before their respective interpersonal dramas came to a head.  And if you\u2019re into shipping, there\u2019s plenty of that to enjoy here \u2014 not just because the game itself facilitates romance, but because the characters are so well-rounded that practically any pairing here can make for pretty cool headcanons.<br><br>All this is not to say that nothing else is impressive here \u2014 the game feels effortlessly complete in no small part because of how the music, backgrounds, and UI complement the script and character design to create a bold, thematically coherent experience. <br><br>But the character revelations and conversations have stayed with me for months, and for me, that\u2019s what makes this game more than worth its price.

I promise it will be worth your money. <br>Long version of my recommendation: <br>Just a note-I originally bought this on itch.io so even though it says I have not played much on Steam I have played pretty much all routes previously. <br><br>Visual novels are a genre of game that I so want to love, but often feel disappointed or even borderline ripped off after playing them. There are some inherent flaws that I find about many of them including the fact that the characters often seem to be generic and personality-less and the &quot;choices&quot; you are given are either so obvious it is boring OR so random it becomes boring in another way. <br><br>This one does not fall into any of those traps. The main character is one of the most unique I have seen in a VN and, by the end of a scene or two, I really loved him. Halfway through the game and I was willing to play for hours to make him happy and eventually play a romantic end for him (which, the romantic ends are a bit tricky to achieve which I count as a positive. I like a challenge and, hey, its sort of like real life romance, right?). The other characters are also unique and likable. I like their design, their personalities, and they feel believable to me. <br><br>What this game also does well that many other VNs do not is the process of making choices. You do have to think about some of your choices and your choices affect the routes in a way that is clear, but not so obvious as to be boring. It is a lot of fun to get some bad endings and then retrace where you made a wrong decision along the way that caused it. In a way, it feels realistic where choices have ripple effects and consequences, negative and positive.  <br>Which brings me to another reason I love this game. So much playtime. Seriously, I have played through most of the routes by now, but I spent hours doing it, enjoyable hours. Sometimes I blow through a VN semi-bored in one night. Not this one. I feel like I got my money's worth and then some. <br><br>It is just a gorgeously designed game with characters that the creators obviously cared about and the design of the choice system is one of the best I have experienced in this genre in quite some time. It revitalized my interest in Visual Novels though now I feel bad for the next one I play because I have high expectations!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22117737', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22117737' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22117737\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22117737' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22117737\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22117737', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22117737_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22117737_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24894859\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198075499197\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"115233469\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c876d159c711f17ac550885619fd8b1eb7c6a12d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c876d159c711f17ac550885619fd8b1eb7c6a12d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c8\/c876d159c711f17ac550885619fd8b1eb7c6a12d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198075499197\/\" data-miniprofile=\"115233469\">Kira User<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198075499197\/games\/?tab=all\">60 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198075499197\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198075499197\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was a rather enjoyable game. I liked the characters, and the art was good. I loved how they used time travel, and how well it fits with the storyline. The thing that made me really happy is to finally have a game where the male character is gay. There are lots of other games with lesbian main characters, or even a main character that can go for both male and female, and the typical heterosexual.

I was worried that the art style would be a little off-putting (dem yaoi hands) but all the little bits and pieces worked together to create a really fun and interesting story. It was really cute and heartwarming and I would definitely recommend if you're into visual novels and time travel. <br><br>Cool Things: <br>It's a really interesting story and it drags you in real deep to figure out the mystery. Lots of choices and nuances to keep you coming back for more and trying out new things. <br>We have a bi main character who admits that they're bi! That's awesome!<br>Lots of character growth - especially for Shuuki our hero. Don't be surprised if you hate him at first, he's a teenager, they do that. <br>All of the characters are distinct - not just a bunch of tropes smashed together - and have interesting things to say and help direct the story and are good indicators of Shuuki's character development. <br>So many animations! Each character blinks, has multiple expressions and body postures to take to keep you interested and convey the nuance of the conversation.<br>Of the possible route endings, three are with Shuuki's brothers - and all of them vague and classy enough to leave it up to the player the definition of their relationship. <br>If you are a hardcore: get all the text, get all the achieves, get all the endings sort of person and are having trouble - there's a built in guide! Much appreciate. <br>The music was all great. I know it's all stock music, but each piece really captured the tone of the moment. <br><br>Some Meh Things: <br>Yaoi hands. I got used to them, definitely thought they were going to be more of a problem than they were - show up in a few postures and CGs but nice to handle. <br>We have a bi main character who only has men as romantic options in this game. Wish there had been a romance option with a woman.<br>We never see Ryo again. I was convinced he was going to play a major part in the story, feel like a boat was missed on that one. <br>You could use the same momento infinitely to change your decisions in the past - but it was unclear which past you were jumping to and modifying and how it was effecting the future.

Now, let me just start by saying I felt iffy going into this game. I honestly felt like the system for time travel was going to be difficult. However, after playing the demo, I've never bought a game so quickly before. So, I'm just going to give my pros and cons on the game.<br><br>Cons:<br>Plot- This is honestly a pro and a con, but for now I'm going to just start off with the problems I had with it. First of all, there were quite a few holes in the plot every so often. The game never really explains what's going on. I've played the game multiple times and have done almost everything but see the bad endings and get one of the mememtos. I've spent a lot of hours on this game. Still, I'm confused on the plot. Not much of it made any sense to me.<br><br>Routes- I don't usually put something as general as routes in the con section of my reviews, but I had to on this one. When I play a game like this I usually try to get a neutral ending first. I don't want to get involved in the other characters too much. Well, I was only able to get the neutral route after 4 playthroughs. It is so hard NOT to get on someone's route. I had to actually focus and make sure I was a d**k to literally every character in order to finally get the neutral ending. <br><br>System- I'm not talking about the time travel system, but the saving\/loading system as a whole. It honestly took me a few mintues to figure out how to save while in game. This is very, very, very minor, but it was something I wanted to mention. I had to right click in-game in order to survive. I'm used to just hitting the save button on the bottom the screen next to the dialogue box. Not in this one. But as I said, this is incredibly minor and doesn't take away from the game at all. <br><br>Mementos- Ok, so it's not a big deal, but it is for me considering I still can't get one. The mementos are kind of difficult to get if you don't know where to look. This is especially frustrating if you like to 100% every game. While most mementos can be found within certain routes as rewards for getting all the flags, the one I'm missing is actually from failing a flag. It's an award and punishment memento and it's annoying how hard it is to go through the game multiple times to try to get just one memento. <br><br><br>Pros:<br>The pros far outweigh the cons, which is why I'm recommending this game in the first place. <br><br>Plot- Yes, this was in the con section, but it is also a huge pro. The plot, while confusing, is so interesting. The main character, Shuuki, is time traveling to save the ones you love from a mysterious killer, all the while trying to keep up his appearances in order to look like everything is fine and he doesn't have two sets of memories. The game is separated into 5 chapters, where one character is murdered per chapter and you spend that chapter trying to save them. It's a wonderful idea and I really enjoyed it. <br><br>Characters- The characters in this game were very well done. There is so much character development for each character. You play one route and think you know one character, only to play their route and see they are completely different from what you imagined. I don't want to spoil the game, so I'm keeping this short, but the characters and their interactions with each other kind of made the game for me.<br><br>Art- The art in this game is beautiful. Shuuki has this gorgeous long hair that I wish my hair could be. The CGI was well done and made it worth all the hard work in order to get them.<br><br>Neutral Feelings:<br>I'm putting this in as I didn't love these things, but I didn't think they made the game bad or upset me enough to put it in the con section.<br><br>Love Routes- There are 4 (technically 5) routes that you can complete in the game. Two involve Chiaki, you're childhood friend, and Yukinari, Masaharu's friend. These routes are great, don't get me wrong. Yukinari was probably my favorite route. However, it felt odd that the game actually pushed you to certain routes. It's sad to say the game didn't really put emphasis on Yukinari at the beginning. He was kind of there and if you decided to do his route you'll find this cute, little sadistic jerk that actually gave a crap about Shuuki. The other two routes....involve the brothers. It's more like brotherly love, and I'm no stranger to yaoi incest relationships, but it felt odd to continuously woo one brother or the other and then end favoriting one Shuuki's older brothers. <br><br>Secret Ending- I wasn't all that into it. I had to get a neutral ending in order to see it. That means no going after anyone. I can not say how many times I accidentally tripped flags. It got to the point where I almost wanted to give up on ever seeing this ending, but I was happy I was finally able to get it. The reason it's in the section and not the Pro section of my review is because it felt almost incomplete. It felt like the creator just decided to through the ending in and that's it, although it was obvious Shuuki could have easily romanced that secret character. <br><br>All in all, the game was wonderful. If you're still iffy, play the demo. The demo is going to give you a good idea on the game and if you really want to invest your time. Even though it's not free, there's enough content to back up the price. I have 10+ hrs on record and I'm still trying to complete CGIs and mementos. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25862210', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25862210' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25862210\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25862210' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25862210\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25862210', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25862210_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25862210_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25390004\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198288266952\/recommended\/432130\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"328001224\">Mother_Penguin<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 31.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI LOVED THIS GAME.

Although the price is a little steep, if you enjoy the visual novel medium, this game is definitely worth the investment. Don't be squicky about the gay romance part of the game, either - the story focuses more on rebuilding broken relationships and coping with tragedy. <br><br>Four out of five stars.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23374323', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23374323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23374323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23374323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23374323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23374323', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23374323_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23374323_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/432130\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 19 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30843797","21168104","21306524","21304794","28778562","21276671","21351136","22117737","24894859","22442555"]}
