I had high hopes for this early access and I was not disappointed. The animations are something that are kind of unique to the world of RPG maker, at least from my experience. They were beautifully done, too. Good soundtrack choices, and the original tracks flowed good with the scenes. I loved the pixel work, especially the sprites. These sprites had quite a bit of work done with them and their movement flows. It's a game with very dark topics, executed very well with an intense story. Wonderful work.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29218556', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29218556' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29218556\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29218556' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29218556\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29218556', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29218556_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29218556_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30073171\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070413278\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"110147550\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3011b04731f6fd5daf27a47b2483cd576eb80407.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3011b04731f6fd5daf27a47b2483cd576eb80407.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3011b04731f6fd5daf27a47b2483cd576eb80407_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070413278\/\" data-miniprofile=\"110147550\">AtlasAtrium<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070413278\/games\/?tab=all\">192 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070413278\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198070413278\/recommended\/507400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Vindictive Drive was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[Intro]<br>Having played and enjoyed War of Existence prior to this, I knew I had to check this one out too and boy was I not disappointed. I went in with pretty high expectations and still it managed to surpass them. This game clicks with me in a way that most games never do and I love everything that it has to offer, but I will try to be as objective as possible with this review. One more thing to note is that the game does not hold back in handling sensitive topics or being quite offensive (coming from the main character herself, no less), but if you can look past that or simply don't mind:<br><br>[Story &amp; Writing]<br>Okay, to get this out of the way first, there are definitely a few grammatical hiccups scattered here and there in the first half of the Early Access version. Later on, the amount of errors increase substantially but I figure that it hasn't gone through the proofreading wringer at those stages yet so it didn't bother me too much.<br><br>Now, the characters. . . I have a few mixed feelings here. I really enjoyed most of the writing in general, including the dialogue. However, I think that the details are important as well, so some of the dialogue (usually involving more minor characters) bugged me. Namely, the evil-coded villains are too one-sidedly, uh, evil. Now, I understand that a lot of these characters are supposed to be awful people with practically no redeeming qualities, but the game itself sets the tone nicely as one that is not black-and-white, but gray. They feel like pieces jutting out in a smooth wall, and while I realize they are here to progress the story or develop the main character, it feels less impactful when you're essentially beating up (or not) a piece of cardboard shaped like a person. In extension to this, there's certainly more than one way to be evil, but it feels like they all read the same villain's goon handbook! I'll leave this up to interpretation, as that doesn't necessarily mean I think you should have them show a little more kindness or something equivalent to that, but simply to make them more believable.<br><br>When it comes to the main characters and the narration in between, that's something I enjoyed thoroughly and you should keep up the good work! It won't be everyone's cup of tea, certainly, but it's definitely mine. The fact that it's so over-the-top balances out the fact that it's a very dark and gritty game, so I never feel like it takes itself too seriously - it's a story that is made to be entertaining and exciting, and that I think it pulls that off extremely well. The pacing leaves some things about the story left to be desired, but it does a far better job of handling it than War of Existence.<br><br>[Gameplay]<br>Ah, the gameplay. . . well, it's definitely going for some realism here and it works well for the game. It only takes a few bullets to kill enemies, just like it only takes a few bullets to kill you. Of course, you're not exactly encouraged to go guns blazing and when you are, it preps you up for it decently enough so you really don't have to worry about it unless you've been absolutely awful with you money\/ammo management. It is rather generous in that regard, I didn't even use half of the ammunition, batteries, and painkillers I had and still had a lot of money to spare. Guess that makes sense though, it's not really a survival game. I liked the scanning\/stealth synergy going on here, although it's really quite simple and there isn't much sneaking around compared to disabling security. It does shake things up every now and then with other elements, so that's a plus - so far, the game isn't long enough for the gameplay become tiresome, but there isn't anything spectacular about it. It does its job as a mode to progress the story, and it does its job adequately. It could grow on me, or it could become a chore, but right now I feel like that's up in the air.<br><br>[Art &amp; Music]<br>Even as far as indie games go, the art quality is very messy. It's rather substandard overall and the amount of time that the art style shifts is kind of insane. Personally, I didn't care about any of that. I love the art in this game, and I love how it so strongly conveys the feelings that the characters are expressing. I also enjoyed the abundance of CGS and short cutscenes for what they were as well, some much choppier and some much smoother.<br><br>As for the music, it didn't quite stick with me, to be honest. I'm gonna bring up War of Existence again because I definitely preferred the music choices in that game. However, that can probably be chalked up to WoE being a freeware title using tracks that don't need to be licensed for non-commercial use so I can see how the selection has narrowed, if that was indeed the problem. The music fits for the game, but ultimately I don't feel like it really enhanced the experience much for me.<br><br>[Personal Enjoyment]<br>All points of review aside. . . I completely adore this game so far! I found the game to be much greater than the sum of its parts, one that really knows how to tell a dark, but also very fun story. I've gone through a lot of freeware, indie, and triple A titles recently, and it's been a long time since I've felt like I was really having fun playing a game. The vibe that this whole game - this whole experience - has, excellently captures the things that I like about not just games, but story telling mediums as a whole. And for that, I give it a whole-hearted recommendation for anyone even remotely interested! I'm very excited to see what's in store for the future and I hope that development will go smoothly all the way through.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div
