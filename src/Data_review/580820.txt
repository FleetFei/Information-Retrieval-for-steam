You control a robot with pincers which allow you to catch the ball. You manouver your robot with the WASD keys and can either Chip the ball, causing a higher ball with less power (Right click on mouse.) or do a power shot, causing the ball to go fast and straight (Left click on mouse.)<br><br>So far, whilst being new to the game a problem I encountered is the 1v1 matches ppear to be very one sided to new comers like myself, with the matches seemingly very one sided to the AI. A noticeable feature I noticed is the AI are able to knock the ball out from your pincers and out of control whilst persuing behind you, thus sometimes making you lose control over a fairly won goal and missing a shot that is not quite lined up, whereas no matter how much I spam left or right click this never seems to have any effect on the AI as it does with me. This may just be down to my own skill level and not the games fault, however. <br><br>Visually, I commend the designers for creating a pitch that refrains from being bland. The incoorperation of various obsticales makes the game play out in a less linear way, testing your ball contol skills and forcing you to sometimes chip the ball over walls and bounce the ball off them. Certain obsticales such as tires are interactive and can be knocked around the pitch to make it much harder to navigate and reach the ball, a very small but lovely touch I enjoyed. <br><br>Overall I do enjoy this game on a casual level, and think I would get more fun with friends and more balanced matches. Personally, I don't think this game deserves its price tag it has currently, and think of this more of a \u00a31.75 game, this could just be me being a cheapskate. However, if new content is added I believe this will still be an enjoyable game. I do not regret buying this. However, if Rocket League is on sale I recommend you pick that game up in priority over Robot Soccer, as the experience is much better and there are more people playing Rocket League on the online multiplayer. <br><br>I would give Robot Soccer a 6\/10. :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30154566', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30154566' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30154566\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30154566' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30154566\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30154566', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30154566_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30154566_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/580820\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30154566"]}
