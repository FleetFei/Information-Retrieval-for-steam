The game had some interesting choices made for it during development it seems though.<br>Let's take a small look at what you can expect _IF_ you decide to buy it at the end of this review.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b> THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED WITH A CONTROLLER, MOUSE AND KEYBOARD DO WORK BUT IT'S UNOPTIMIZED <\/b><\/div><br>Dungeon Siege 3 hosts a few terrain problems in some areas that force you to turn the camera 180 degrees before you can get away, unless you changed the basic controls (W S = movement, A D = turn camera). Don't be scared of this though, it'll mostly happen at the very edge of the paths and normally doesn't happen during boss fights.<br>We also don't get to evade past enemies (at least this seems to be the case most of the time) but you get i-frames during your dashes so just dash away once you find your character. DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF YOUR OWN CHARACTER.<br><br>If you love a challenge, you'll enjoy the &quot;hardcore&quot; mode, which no- it's not actually hardcore, it's a cool word for hard to them. Powerleveling won't get you anywhere as the enemies randomly jump in power, and any spray or ability that makes the floor deal damage over time will -most- likely 1-shot you, there's no limit for how fast it damages you so you can drop really damn fast, and they decided to let most bosses and later mobs have at least one of these two.<br><br>That being said, every start is troublesome until you get to the first town I'd say, an unequipped character is exceptionally weak, and easy becomes really easy as soon as you start getting gear. <br>Normal is still fine for a small challenge later on, though you'll probably be equipped and confident enough to win every fight.<br><br>There's also a few more things worth noting, this IS a ported game (at least feels very much like it) and IS made for 2 player co-op (I'm not sure if you can do 3 players or more, I haven't tested it.) Playing anything but easy or normal on singleplayer is like asking for someone to make you mad because honestly, the AI is the worst I've ever seen in any game, the way it attacks and positions makes no sense at all, it feels like it just spams random buttons in hopes of doing something useful. They also try to revive you instantly even if it's dangerous, so don't play this alone, you'll regret it.<br>So please, do not buy this game for a fun solo rpg game, because this is a co-op\/multiplayer rpg, not a solo one.<br><br>YES, you CAN respec in case you ruin something or want to change skills, but this requires the DLC and it isn't needed at all. <br>At max level you'll have 3-4 talents untouched and 2-3 ability upgrades untouched and from my experience there's always at least two abilities you don't want to level, because others are much better to use.<br><br>While we're already on abilities, the game introduces &quot;Mastery&quot; for abilities, which is based off of times used rather than time used or damage dealt with abilities, so keep that in mind when going for that.<br><br>When travelling in the game there's a few things that are nice to know.<br>Firstly, the screen is capped in the area the players are currently in on any given map, P1 counts as a host in a signal, if P2 tries to dash away or other things, they'll be reset and teleported next to P1 exactly like AI will if they get too far away from the host. <br>This also means that both players have to co-operate when going places, or else one of the players have to let the other run around freely. This can be done by having either P1 or P2 open up any menu (c, x, f -- etc, though not escape menu) which will force the player into AI mode, It's best to have the player return to moving their character around before combat as the AI sometimes will force the player to stay locked out of their character because they're either using a skill, following a pattern of commands or a third thing that makes no sense at all. This can make it seem like you're unable to control your character at all, which technically is the case, but the AI has registered that you want to go back to control so it won't force you out completely. It will most likely stop attacking soon enough and you can help this by spamming the evade key just keep in mind that it won't always help and you can be stuck unable to control your character for a bit, so please try to have everyone out of menus before combat for your own sake. It helps a lot.<br>P1 is also the ONLY person that can interact with people and quest items\/objects and NPCs. I can't tell you why they decided to do it like this, but that's how it is. P2 (and others) CANNOT progress quests, interact with quest objects (unless they just have to pick it up for pull a lever) or talk to NPCs.<br> <br>Here's a final thing for playing multiplayer as well. Your mic is automatically turned on and you cannot disable it in-game for some reason. If you don't want it to be like this, change your mic settings under steam settings -&gt; voice, add push to talk or change the mic to something that doesn't work.<br><br>I believe I have mentioned anything worth mentioning in this game, and I'll answer any question needed in the comments. <br><br>Besides everything I have adressed, I love the game.<br>I love playing the game despite getting mad at sudden barrage of projectiles 1-shotting me on Hard, or other things.<br><br>The story is average to good, you don't really have any big options in the game, but picking the right thing to talk about at the right time earns you small bonuses. &quot;Deeds&quot; give you <i>minor<\/i> stat bonuses and some you get from talking, others you get from really exploring and checking out everything you can. Exploring pays off in terms of items and deeds, rushing the game lets you farm achievements I suppose, but why would you do that in an RPG?<br><br>The gameplay pays off tacticians on Hard, and lets people playing on Easy mess around and have fun, there's a fine balance from Easy to Normal, though Hard is a thing for itself. <br>The graphics are also where they should be I feel, they don't seem old nor super high-tech, I may be biased as I prefer it when games look like how Dungeon Siege 3 does, but I wouldn't say the graphics are bad at, they suit a game from it's year.<br><br>If you like the first 3-5 hours of the game I would buy the DLC if you have the chance, the DLC adds 5 hours of gameplay I'd say, if not more, and gives you just a little bit more to do in the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30932692', 'summary' );

I pulled up the review box immediately.<br><br>Guys and gals... I really like this game.<br><br>When I first saw it being paraded about, advertised, I came under the impression that it was a fantasy-action romp through a rich setting. I saw that it had unique characters. I concluded it had nice voice acting. My impressions were correct.<br><br>While I grew up beside Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Nights, Vampire the Masquerade, and manymanymore CRPGs, I never actually got around to playing Chris Avellone's epic: Dungeon Siege. Over time it became dated, and somehow thrown into my own personal category of &quot;just another old fantasy title&quot; (Like The Summoner. Man, that needs a remake). <br><br>I bring up my gaming heritage to illustrate that I love Oldschool roleplaying. I probably would have liked Dungeon Siege. but I never played it. I walked into Dungeon Siege i-i-i without any expectations except for those listed above. <br><br>Thus, for the sake of the other (negative) reviewers let me say: If I was expecting a fantasy epic stat crunching party based spacebar-to-pause open world fantasy, I too would have been a sore child. These things DS iii is not. So, let me tell you what it is.<br><br>Hopeful. Noble. And well meaning.<br><br>It is an important piece of story in the world of Ehb. You can tell because your choices are explained to you in the end. I love it when they do that, and I haven't gotten such a kick out of it since Arcanum (don't get me started on Arcanum, I'll start drooling). <br><br>This was written carefully. Characters have personality and charm (even if that personality is merely &quot;flirty russian&quot;). They say things that matter. A lot of work was put into their comments and role in the game. They aren't just a sandbox of people you can choose from the beginning, or just meet along the way. These characters are part of the tale. Some more than others. Their models are well designed, from the somewhat pudgy Reinhart, to the seductive Katarina. Their voice acting is mostly excellent (I'm looking at you Anjala, that synthesizer seems to throw off your tone). <br><br>There are a finite number of side-quests, and low and behold a lot of them impact the story in small and meaningful ways. The continuity was surprising.<br><br>Surprising.<br><br>In a game set in a rich and lore filled world, and one that has a legacy to live up to, I must mention the abominable level design. It's a corridor. This broadens slighly in the later levels, but my first piece of advice to any new player would be to turn off the mini-map. You don't need it (unless you get turned around), and it will just depress you. Ignore the map and take in the sights. There are nice sights in this game. <br><br>The graphics are well designed. The engine was meant to eliminate load times by loading the next area as you play (this and the fact it came out for last-gen consoles might explain the linearity), but still manages to put a nice glowy sheen on everything. Mud looks sumptuous, water ripples, and sewer bricks glisten. Attacks carry graphical weight, and hits are punctuated nicely. There's lots of flair here. I especially love the teleport animations for Reinhart, the wizard.<br><br>If you've never seen them let me give you my next piece of advice, new player: Play this game on Hardcore. <br><br>Hardcore, because combat is really good when you need to dodge. Actually, nerf that. Combat is good ALL the time. Animations are smooth, and attacks are flashy. Until you clear an area, enemies tend to respawn, but there is really no need to grind. Once you start getting your groove into that leveling system you will tear them a new one all whilst proceeding forward gracefully. <br><br>Once you finish an act, much of the villainy is narrated away, so you can wander about once more with a minimum of fuss, should you desire. You really shouldn't. There is no point in returning to old areas unless you collect Unique weapons.<br><br>In the realm of combat are the epic, epic boss fights. No, not just any joe-shmoe &quot;leader&quot; of a group with a health bar, I'm talking the real bosses.  You'll know one when you meet one. There will be a sort of arena that appears, a flash of special effect, and you'll get stomped.<br><br>It's glorious.<br><br>These bosses shake up the fighting with excellent special moves and themes. I wish the same care had been taken for the usual enemies.<br><br>I've digressed from my original points. Hopeful. Noble. Well meaning.<br><br>The real draw here is the story. A story that continues the CRPG tradition of interaction. The gameplay is fun and arcady, the mechanics are fine, but suddenly you'll be placed with a true conundrum on your hands.

I gave it a little bit of a start back then but decided to just sit down and finish it this time.  A little more than 24 hours later and I finished both the game and its DLC.  I played as Anjali and maxed out Influence with Lucas and got halfway there with Katarina, and barely used Reinhart.  I used an Xbox 360 controller for the whole game, playing in Fire Form and shooting people from afar and using her area-of-effect abilities when crowded.  I'll explain that in a bit.<br><br>First, yes, Dungeon Siege III isn't really a good Dungeon Siege game.  To me, DS games were about fielding a rather large array of characters and playing Diablo with them, as opposed to the &quot;player and AI helper and summons&quot; that's been the norm since at least Diablo II.  Everyone had personality!  And instead of hitting an arbitrary experience level and being given points to allocate, you had a 'gain by doing' system typical of some MMOs.  If you swing a melee weapon a bunch, you'd gain ranks in the Melee class; if you used Combat Magic, you'd gain in Combat Magic.  It did things kinda differently even though its goal of being a &quot;Diablo killer&quot; didn't quite take.  So is Dungeon Siege III a bad game?  No.  It's just not really good as far as DS games of past, at least in terms of gameplay.  It's pretty different.  <br><br>Things are pretty bad for the 10th Legion in Ehb.  Supposedly they murdered the king three decades ago and some fanatic from the church is hell-bent on killing every single Legionnaire, going as far as turning pretty much the entire country against them.  How lucky that you're one of the last few descendants of the Legion.  Join with your old friend Odo at the old Montbarron Estate and plot a counterattack!  I'm sure nothing bad will happen before you get there...   <br><br>Dungeon Siege III is an action RPG like previous entries in the series, but combat is a bit different and there's an even bigger focus on story than even DS2.  Instead of creating a character from scratch, you instead have your pick between the sword-and-board knight Lucas, the spear and fireballs archon Anjali, the handguns and rifle Katarina, and the magic and more magic Reinhart.  The story changes slightly based on who you pick, and you're able to meet the other three characters as you play and have them join you.  DS3's 'gimmick' with combat revolves around the two stances.  One stance is designed to deal with multiple targets close-by, like when you get mob rushed.  The other is meant to handle single targets and for everyone but Lucas, you're able to attack at a great range with this.  The idea is to swap modes as combat progresses but I didn't really do that.  I can't remember any situation where you explicitly needed a ranged attack, so it's largely down to the stance's attacks and how comfortable you are with using them.  <br><br>When you level up, you slowly unlock additional attacks for your two offensive stances and enable options for your third defensive stance.  Each stance has three attacks and there are three options for defense, so you have nine total moves for each character.  Each move can then be enhanced five times each from a pool of two mods--for example, one of Anjali's Fire Form special attacks creates a burning field under her.  Your choice of enhancements are to simply boost the damage output of the attack or have it slowly heal any allies standing in its area of effect.  You are able to mix the effects, but you're limited to a max of five no matter what.  And you're also given points to provide unique passive boosts to your character, such as a percent chance to start regenerating health when damaged, a greater chance to crit a target at full health, or to simply boost one stat.  Though you cannot take control of your allies, you can still equip them and allocate skill points and so on as if you could, so there's still some customizing potential.  The Treasures of the Sun DLC adds the ability to completely respec your characters for 20,000 gold each--a little pricey but it's the only way to undo mistakes you've made in your build during the game.  <br><br>DS3 has completely done away with potions.  Small orbs drop from containers or enemies during combat--green ones restore health, blue ones restore Focus, and purple ones with yellow outlines restore Power.  Focus takes the place of traditional MP in this game.  You only ever have a max of 100 of it, and every special attack drains a set amount of it.  It's restored by using your regular attack on enemies.  Power is used to fuel your defensive stance's moves as well as the 'empowered' versions of every move, and that's restored by using your special attacks on enemies or taking damage.  Empowered basic attacks generally deal more damage or hit a wider area, but empowered special attacks have effects like much more damage, a wider range, or being able to affect your ally as well as yourself.  Empowered basic attacks are enabled as soon as you get the first Power orb, but getting it for special attacks requires you to use them quite a bit during your journey. The game at least lists the empowered benefit even before you purchase the special attack for use, so that's very handy.  <br><br>There's still randomly-enchanted gear to find like in any ARPG.  You have a pretty spacious inventory of I think a bit over 80 slots, but it can fill up especially if you forget to dump your trash at the local merchant.  You can Transmute unwanted gear to get a fraction of its value in gold immediately and with the DLC, you can break down some gear to get reagents to apply to other gear with Enchantment, but I never really made use of it.  Everyone has eight equipment slots and navigating it wasn't too bad with a controller.  Each slot is a category and only the relevant gear shows up.  You're given a window where what you have on is compared to what you have selected along with green and red arrows showing the changes in stats.  Takes out some of the guesswork when you've figured out how to read it at least.  This is the first game like this in a long time if ever where NPCs sold unique-class equipment.  They still drop, but it didn't feel like it was at random.  There's no player stash so holding onto them isn't really useful.  They kept the &quot;pick up everything nearby&quot; button from the first two games though!  So looting won't be tedious at all.  <br><br>One problem I had with the game was that it took me a good while to really get into it.  I don't know how much of it was &quot;ugh this isn't Dungeon Siege of old&quot; wearing off, but it did finally endear itself to me.  It's too bad that point was roughly past halfway, though.  I didn't do multiplayer but it has a pretty weird setup.  You join someone's game and you play as one of their characters...and you take nothing back with you.  Anything that drops stays with the host.  You don't even get experience points or progress through the story.  I didn't like the lack of fast-travel options.  No Town Portal, no warping between save points, just you and having to hoof it at a plodding max speed.  And...there's no way to save anywhere like the prior games.  There are several save points, but I ran into &quot;you cannot save until combat has ended&quot; more than a few times, even if enemies weren't in the immediate area.  Pretty annoying.  <br><br>Overall, Dungeon Siege III isn't a bad action RPG.  It's likely not going to be fondly remembered and some would argue it was what killed the franchise, if it'll be remembered at all.  To me, it didn't really do anything terribly unique, nothing that was memorable other than having a lot of polish, especially for an Obsidian game.  I had maybe two bugs and zero crashes the entire game, and that's pretty notable.  But yeah.  It's not bad, just not a good Dungeon Siege.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30881987', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30881987' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30881987\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30881987' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30881987\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30881987', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30881987_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30881987_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t114 of 145 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15673789\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"113225593\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60dceb68980385b4f3ebee74b70eb4d2202c8054.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60dceb68980385b4f3ebee74b70eb4d2202c8054.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60dceb68980385b4f3ebee74b70eb4d2202c8054_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/\" data-miniprofile=\"113225593\">SpookyEmily<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/games\/?tab=all\">49 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073491321\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPROS:<br>1.

I mean it was so bad, I almost didn't want to play this game.<br>2. No zooming in feature.<br>3. Playing as Lucas is darn near impossible. You're in for a huge challenge if you decide to play as him.<br>4. This game has near NOTHING to do with the first two games, therefore making it more of its own game rather than a continuation to the series.<br><br>I felt like I owed this game my two cents because honestly I'm astonished at the amount of bad reviews. I will fully admit to this: After I first bought the game I only played it for one hour before giving up in frustration. The camera control in this game is absolutely TERRIBLE. If they would have just made it so the camera follows the way the character is facing, it would have solved the problem entirely. I also hated the fact I can't zoom in at all, because I like to look at my character and the monster detail closely on occasion. Despite this, I decided to give the game another chance later on because I am a huge fan of the Dungeon Siege series and I really wanted to finish the third installment. Getting used to the stupid camera controls took a lot of patience but eventually I found I had almost shrugged off an awesome game. The lore and storyline is rich and engaging, arguably the best aspect of this game. I also really enjoy how my decisions shape the game's outcomes and relationships with the other playable characters, much like The Walking Dead series (which I also love). The graphics and music are great, the voice acting is excellent. I liked how the maps were easy to follow and I almost never got lost due to the really great quest trail feature. Being able to swap between &quot;stances&quot; or whatever you want to call them during battle was near seamless. I actually liked that you had to point and click in the direction of the enemy rather than mindlessly clicking once on a target and letting your character attack by themselves as in DS1 and DS2(that is, if you choose the DS1 style of doing that when playing DS2). Many will argue that just having four generic characters is boring and un-inventive on the player's part - however I personally feel it is a refreshing change. You get to uncover this character's rich backstory, and learn their personality and style as you play. It's almost like getting to know a new friend rather than just making up a fake one. lol. Besides, I could spend upwards of 1-2 hours fully customizing my character down to the shape of her nose (*cough* Elder Scrolls anyone?) and for what? She's going to be wearing a helmet anyway, and even if you have a mod to make it so you can see your character's face, how often are you actually going to look at it? It ends up being kinda tedious, especially since I just want to get onward to the game! I -would- have liked to at least be given the choice of keeping their generic name OR coming up with my own like some RPGs, but meh it's not a game-changer for me either. As for other things I DON'T like about this game, let's talk about Lucas for a second. I'm a straight girl, so when I saw Lucas I was like wow this guy looks super hot...I'm going to try him out. ;P BIG mistake. The problem with Lucas is that to do any real damage you have to basically be up the enemy's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, and when you're in the process of doing that in a huge mass of flustercuck you're going to get mowed down as often as the White House lawn. Unless you fully specced into every healing ability possible and have a ton of chaos:vampirism as Lucas, then you're in for a world of pain my friend. I don't really like when a game forces me to spend all my talent currency in ONE thing. Like okay well if I don't want to die over and over and over again I better spend everything in every healing ability possible. Super lame! My favorite character has got to be Katarina. Her gear looks cute and girly, her voice actress sounds exotic and awesome, and she hits like a truck from afar. I can just sit back and send my cool hound in while doing some badarse sniping and when the enemy gets too close I can just switch to my sidearms and deal powerful knockback damage. Amazing. Anjali is also fricken AWESOME. She's absolutely beautiful, especially in her fire form with all those tribal tattoos and the orange eyes. The way they made her voice actress (as well as the other archon in the game) sound all ethereal-ish was cool as hell too, it really added depth to the exotic element of her race. Her fire jackal is super cute, I love the little noises he makes!! Her self-healing is ridiculously through the roof, it's almost impossible to die as her if you do it right. She also has some decent range on her attacks, and both of her forms are viable though I tend to stick more to her fire form. Reinhart is the only one I haven't tried yet and meh, I probably won't. For some reason whenever I look at him I think of the Sultan from Aladdin and I start laughing. Also the way he talks is kind of annoying. lol. I've never even used him as the AI. I'm sure he's a great character with great abilities if I just gave him the chance, but meh. Moving on, I see a lot of people complaining about the very basic talent tree but let me tell you something, I WELCOMED it. Huge, complicated talent trees with a billion different avenues has always been one of the things I actually DON'T like about RPGs. It's like, here let me google online what is the very best talent tree and fricken -research- how to play my dang character. Otherwise I'm going to be halfway through a game and realize shoot I totally screwed up my talent tree and I can't go back so now I either keep playing and pretend it doesn't bother me or restart. GROAN. It's like work instead of play at that point! In closing, I see a lot of the angry people are commenting that they don't like this game simply because it isn't like the other two. True, it IS sort-of a letdown that this game has next-to-nothing similar with the first two games other than some very minor basic lore ties. But I wouldn't just throw out the whole thing just because it isn't a similar or because it &quot;shames the franchise&quot;. I tend to want to look at it as its own game...just ignore the whole continuation of the 3 slapped onto the name. :P\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15673789', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15673789' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15673789\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15673789' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15673789\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15673789', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15673789_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15673789_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t104 of 140 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9343576\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"83119678\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ea\/ea461c29290c8ac5d29e938b5c891acc031f2385.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ea\/ea461c29290c8ac5d29e938b5c891acc031f2385.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ea\/ea461c29290c8ac5d29e938b5c891acc031f2385_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83119678\">Krakob<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/games\/?tab=all\">207 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Krakob\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDungeon Siege III really falls somewhere between good and bad but in the end, I do think it was a fun experience.<br>The game takes place in a generic fantasy setting where generic evil people are being generically evil and you, the generic hero of a generic almost extinct generic group of generic heroes do generic things in the name of generic goodness.<br><br>My playthrough took place with a friend. He played the generic wizard and I played the generic swordsman. We played on the hardest difficulty. While the game offers some fun hack and slash combat, there's nothing very special with it. Each character has two modes (zwiehander\/sword+shield, rifle\/dual pistols, etc.) with three skills per mode in addition to three defensive abilitites. While I do believe you're supposed to use both of your modes, there seemed to be no benefit in doing so for me. I just went berserk with my zweihanders and that worked terrifically.<br><br>I can't say anything about lower difficulties but we mostly found the regular enemies to be rather trivial while the bosses were hard only because they could kill you in one or two hits. This was challenging and fun in its own way but not in a good way as this was more like artificial difficulty where you're punished for a single mistake.<br><br>With this in mind, the balance between bosses wasn't good, either. One early boss was super hard while others were a breeze. The penultimate boss was one of the hardest in the game while the last boss was a joke.<br><br>Lastly, the game had some notable issues with other aspects. The depiction of women felt rather sexistic as you could usually judge the moral level of a woman by looking at the size of her breasts. Big breasts - good person. Small breasts - evil person. The camera was a pain as my partner and I limited each others' movements, which was super problematic as he was a long range character and I was purely melee. As far as I know, the game is purely a console port and although it could actually be good, I'm not so certain that it's good if you don't have a gamepad to play with.<br><br>So that's my review. You can see that I ended up giving it a recommendation but that's a weak recommendation. I do not recommend buying this game unless you'll either have someone to play with or if you can get it for less than the base cost.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9343576', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9343576' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9343576\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9343576' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9343576\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9343576', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9343576_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9343576_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t88 of 117 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12582251\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"67518803\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d82c58445671767a10e07b7fa9bb0444b6ee9d05.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d82c58445671767a10e07b7fa9bb0444b6ee9d05.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d8\/d82c58445671767a10e07b7fa9bb0444b6ee9d05_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67518803\">Cinetyk<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/games\/?tab=all\">190 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Cinetyk\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">32.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 20, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Summary <\/u> (TL;DR)<br>Dungeon Siege III, while not stellar, is a bit underrated or otherwise suffers unjustly from its departure from the original games of old. Those had more of a Diablo-like interface, with top down, mouse point&amp;click, party management gameplay, with classes, gear and loot. Dungeon Siege III was clearly designed for consoles and controller use, as the keyboard and mouse controls are very awkward and it has a more 3rd person view. Without a controller, it is very difficult to play this game. <br>I\u2019m a fan of the original game, and I found that despite the change in paradigm to a 3rd person hack and slash action RPG designed for the controller, the Dungeon Siege \u201cfeel\u201d is there. Experiencing the different events in the story, meeting new characters and talking to them, going from location to location, playing the combat, collecting loot, and optimizing abilities and equipment in regards to combat, all was rather enjoyable. None was arguably groundbreaking, but was interesting and enjoyable enough to keep me invested for 32 hours, which, in retrospect, is saying something. 7\/10<br><br><u>Detailed review<\/u><br>RPG-wise, it\u2019s actually quite deep with lots of stats and mechanics. You choose from 4 different main characters with different characteristics and play styles: a knight for meele\/tank, a rifle and pistol\/shotgun wielding ranged character, an agile fire magic female warrior and a spell casting mage\/scientist. One of the other characters follows you as an AI companion. Each character has 2 stances that can be switched on the fly, each stance has one attack and 3 active abilities. There are also 3 defensive abilities per character. Active abilities include heavier or AOE attacks, buffs\/debuffs, or even summoned creatures. Defensive abilities include healing, pushing back of enemies or buffing yourself. As you use attacks and abilities you fill their mastery bar and once you\u2019ve mastered it, you can perform an empowered version of it. As you level up, you can develop each of your abilities in a branching choice, for instance do you want more damage or increased chance to knockback opponents? You can go all in on one, or choose any balance between the two. Additionally, there are passive \u201ctalents\u201d to level up. With all this and also the different equipment you loot, buy and enhance with enchantments (3 weapon slots, 4 armor slots, a ring and a pendant slot), with different stats, you have a vast array of possibilities. You can choose the abilities\u2019 perks to work well with one another enhancing your favorite play style, and also compliment your companion\u2019s abilities to your own, which is very satisfying, particularly, I suspect, in local coop.<br>However, with this 2-stance system sometimes it\u2019s a bit difficult perform actions from different stances in the heat of battle with a lot going on. Of course, it would be easier with pausable combat and 1-9 keyboard hotkeys, but this is a 3rd person action game. Also, the way aiming works is a bit awkward, especially for ranged combat, as you have to move in the direction of an enemy to soft lock on it. This results in sometimes having to move away to get a better line of sight to the desired target. I got used to it, though. Additionally, the companion AI is not ideal, though it\u2019s reasonable. Again, local coop should be fun.<br><br>I won\u2019t spoil the story, which I found surprisingly interesting, meaning that the game is far from a loot fest. Events are set approximately 150 years after the first game, much of what once was has fallen or faded, and the characters from the first game are now close to legends, which also means you don\u2019t need to play the other games to enjoy this one. You\u2019ll learn of what happened as you progress in the game, your journey has always that tone of grandeur lost as you seek to reestablish some of that. You\u2019ll meet interesting characters and the plot will make you reflect on your actions and compare them to the main antagonist, and also think about your dialogue choices. The voice acting is also good and the dialogues lengthy. The lore is very well done, tying in nicely to the Dungeon Siege universe, and is deepened by finding some books or documents, and talking to characters. You\u2019ll even explore a location directly related to the characters of the first game, which was extremely satisfying for a fan.<br><br>The progression is mostly linear with growing scale of locations, enemies and events. It\u2019s an action RPG, but the pacing and amount of enemies is not insane like for instance on Diablo 3, though some battles are more enemy heavy. Though there are different and varied locations with enemies matching them, \u201cdungeons\u201d aren\u2019t as big as in the first game, but nonetheless acceptably lengthy. <br><br>The graphics are quite good, showing some age by now, but at least in runs well, high FPS. However, the camera is always restricted to look down a little, so you can\u2019t tilt it up and enjoy the scenery in a more 1st person style, which is a shame. That restriction also sometimes doesn\u2019t provide the best view for combat either. Though different equipment reflects visibly on the characters, there\u2019s no way to view the full character close up and rotate it, like in a character screen. The HUD is somewhat simplistic, as are the indications above enemies, which at first makes it a bit difficult to understand what\u2019s going on.<br><br>The soundtrack is quite good, mostly in the atmospheric orchestral style, aiding to that tone of grandeur lost, but with tense and epic combat sequences. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12582251', 'summary' );

Once you get the hang of it you\u00b4ll discover a whole different game than the one described by most of the reviews.<br><br>So, my advice, coming form a HUGE Dungeon Siege fan, that spent hundreds of hours on the previous titles, is to give this game a chance, making an effort to completely forget this is called Dungeon Siege 3, and after the initial hate ends, you\u00b4ll be surprised.<br><br>8\/10 (Y)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13556382', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13556382' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13556382\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13556382' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13556382\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13556382', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13556382_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13556382_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13127837\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bradleypariah\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"45141294\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7ffe7b7ae88c15bbe7df4178dfa49cd0e3ba7d0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7ffe7b7ae88c15bbe7df4178dfa49cd0e3ba7d0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7ffe7b7ae88c15bbe7df4178dfa49cd0e3ba7d0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bradleypariah\/\" data-miniprofile=\"45141294\">bradleypariah<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bradleypariah\/games\/?tab=all\">264 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bradleypariah\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bradleypariah\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">35.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 28, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTry to imagine Obsidian's role-playing dialog system embedded into the console port of Diablo III.

Many fans of DS1 and DS2 appear incapable of liking this game, and it seems a lot of them feel tricked out of their cash.  I'll mention their gripes here, however, to give a fair review, I don't want to just look at what DS3 *isn't*.  I want to review it based on its own merit. To be up front, I actually hated DS3 at first, but when I was looking for a co-op to play with my non-gamer wife, I took a second look at Dungeon Siege 3.  I found I had completely changed my perception of this game, because I changed my perception of its design choices, and it actually became one of my favorites of all time.<br><br>Dungeon Siege III is a gamepad-friendly isometric action RPG with local and online co-op.  While much more casual than its predecessors, there's still plenty of quests, hacking, slashing, shooting, magic, looting, upgrades, lore, and dialog - and when multiple players (online or off) are in a story conversation together, players can vote for their preferred responses to NPCs, albeit Player 1 has the final say.<br>There are four characters to choose from, and each delivers a different fighting style (melee, ranger, sniper, magician). Each character also has two &quot;stances&quot; to vary up their attack strengh, range, and\/or speed.  Not to mention, the back story will also change, according to which hero you've selected.<br><br>Gone is the tactical pause.  Gone is the squad management.  Gone are the skill points you earn, specific to your fighting style.  Gone are the multiple skill trees for each character.  Each weapon and piece of armor you find can only be equipped by a specific character.  Obsidian has &quot;streamlined&quot; this game, effectively consolizing it.  This is the heart of Dungeon Siege 2 fans' complaints, besides multiplayer camera controls and multiplayer inventory management.  You now will be only upgrading a single skill tree for your character, which means close vs ranged combat will not award skill toward that specific stance. Instead of holding down on right-click to attack, you'll button-mash, and each press will be one swing\/shot. Also annoying to some, even when you gain NPC followers, you will not be in charge of their tactics, nor their upgrades.<br><br>This game was developed by the same people who made South Park: The Stick of Truth, Fallout: New Vegas, Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Alpha Protocol.  I loved all of those games.  My point, they KNOW role-playing.  In my opinion, the story here is great.  If you don't have nostalgia stars in your eyes, it's easy to see that the voice acting here is by far superior to its predecessors.  Although the story is drastically shorter, it's certainly more focused.<br><br>All in all, I can tell you this:  if you have a friend or loved one you want to play an immersive, open-world action RPG with while sitting on the couch together, this is the game. You'll find a rich story, a simple skill tree, upgrades, dialog choices, and tons of loot.  It's one of the best (and few) couch co-ops that delivers a true RPG experience.  Plus, gamers of all experience levels can enjoy it together.<br>I come from a Fallout 3 background, but my wife is really only good at Bejewelled and racing games.  While I was able to try to craftfully master my character's moves, she was able to button-mash with a rifle-wielding hottie from a distance, and we made an excellent team!  We were able to hack\/slash\/loot our way all the way through the campaign +DLC together and we both had a blast.  If you've ever played\/enjoyed Diablo 3 or Daggerdale on the couch with friends and\/or family, and you like the idea of breaking up the action with cutscenes and dialog choices once in a while, I'm telling you, this really is an awesome game.<br><br>If you're looking for the next 100-hour tactical RPG in the Dungeon Siege universe, buyer beware.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13127837', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13127837' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13127837\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13127837' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13127837\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13127837', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13127837_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13127837_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t51 of 71 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12616037\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"60040781\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d246d069615baccd843682c0a64a89f98bcc9365.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d246d069615baccd843682c0a64a89f98bcc9365.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d246d069615baccd843682c0a64a89f98bcc9365_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/\" data-miniprofile=\"60040781\">Thulsa Doom<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/games\/?tab=all\">216 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020306509\/recommended\/39160\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 24, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tProbably the most important info about this game is: This is not hack&amp;slash.

It has different controls, is set forth in time and you are presented with more modern battles, guns and cannons. People complained about DS2 saving game, now you are presented with more save slots but on certain check points.<br><br>Since beginning, it seems like very easy game, most attacks can be dodged and enemies do not kill you with one hit even on Hardest difficulty. Suddenly, after few hours in, you meet your first real opponent, you get to meet boss. If you thought it is going to be running through paradise with nice graphics and boring storytelling, you are WRONG. First boss makes you use your brain and tactics in practice. Basically, whole game spawns you with weak to moderate minions at which you will practice your skills, untill late game where these minions become strong as their numbers grow. The hardest part of game are boss fights, there are plenty and interestingly different from each other.<br><br>I can not forget to mention mini-bosses, Lore if you like reading stories, nice outfits which affect your stats. Forget everything about stats from previous titles. This time you are not earning points towards some skill, for example mellee or ranged or magical but you get 9 powers, 3 superpowers (only DLC), you add points towards them which add bonuses, so 1 power has 2 options for bonuses which can be maxed out with 5 points. By the end of game, you will have unlocked all 9 powers but can add maxed out bonuses only to half of them.<br><br>The big issue is a camera which is moving by A\/D by default which can be edited and you are presented with close to action sight and a little further sight which is not far enough and close camera is also not close enough. If you want to see your character upclose, you can do it in conversations but mostly they are turned by back to you. But seeing your character upclose is possible by moving towards the wall and looking from above wall. Not being able to see far across the field may be frustrating sometimes but brings you a little surprise and is not overally destroying the experience, it just needs a little getting used to it and adjusting your controls (not me).<br><br>Most of time I was not reading Lore, but enjoyed talking to characters, sometimes simple, but mostly you have options which will affect the outcome, sometimes slightly, in main quests will change your fate in end cutscene, and you certainly want to ask everything possible so you do not jump up on some tough boss without proper preparation. Before every boss fight and even without that reason, you have check point to save your game or game automatically saves, so you can go back and make yourself better, change companion or whatever.<br><br>Last important thing that is not similar to previous titles, you only control one character at once and can have one active companion so you can fight with two heroes at once. Game offers you with 4 heroes total to choose from. There is not gender customization, you just take already prepared character with some predispositions and history. So your main characters are mellee fighter Lucas, combat magician Anjali, support magician Reinhart, ranged Katarina.<br><br>Know that healing is mandatory, if you fall your companion revives you, but can be interrupted by enemy attacks. There is no thing as automatic health regeneration but skill that heals you by few points per second. Your mana is called Focus and is fueling your skills and strong attacks. Later you are presented with orbs which will accumulate by attacks and can be used in DLC for super powers which are very effective in late game.<br><br>Which character to choose? What is difference?<br>Lucas has most armor, is overally useful in mid-game and gets overpowered equipment in DLC.<br>Anjali is good healer for early-game but does not have too much armor, can summon Fire Jackal.<br>Reinhart is strong support and good in late-game, moderate armor. Strong against bosses.<br>Katarina is almost naked so no armor, summons Black Hound. Her strength is her fire gun.<br><br>You can gain influence over your companions while you make a good decision. This influence will create some boosts. There are more boosts to aquire by simply achieving main quests and making right decisions. Side quests make nice addition to game, but often you will have to go back on the map and return for reward since you already managed to travel across quiet some space.<br><br>In mid-game you have teleports available but forget those in previous titles. Again, you have original Causeways which only permit you to go to your previous important locations (hideouts and entrances to some dungeons) and are very few, and mostly you will use these for main quest purpose. It does not make your game easier for moving around world. It just tries to get you on vibe this game is fantasy and relates to the old titles which are in fact different.<br><br>I must not forget your inventory is limited so selling some of your stuff is useful, not only at the beginning when you try to raise some funds for getting better gear which is in fact not so good from the drops. But as you proceed in game, you will have better equipment and variety in goods and more sellers. I achieved 300k gold by the end of game which I could not use other way better than empowering my ring with special orbs (only for DLC) which made my game easy.<br><br>In fact, I would seriously struggle without DLC, the Hardest difficulty is a real challange and read reviews of people who struggled on Casual difficulty, so think of your patience first. If you already read all my review, you will be able to withstand the Hardest challenge available. This game is awesome and first impression of it being different, what a surprise, will it get better? changed to this game is awesome and addicitve.<br><br>DLC is worth too much. I became overpowered after finishing the storyline of DLC. I got some overpowered equipment for Lucas as he was my companion. To that, got nice superpowers. And story of DLC and world around is nice, you also get to see your characters up close as game itself never shows them to you in the face, rather just from back. It is challenging as well, untill you discover the last superpower which makes you so absolutely strong against main game bosses that it feels almost like cheating.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30727410', 'recent_short' );

I don't play them for the challenge but i do not mind some challenge like having to at least be fully awake to not get destroyed. My favorite games with role playing aspects are elder scrolls IV Oblivion, Dragon Age Origins, Fable the lost chapters, Starwars knights of the old republic, and world of warcraft.<br><br>I am about an hour into the game playing on the highest visual preset, not an astonishing feat seeing as how this game came out in 2011 and believe me it needs it. It isn't a graphical marvel even for 2011 standards but that shouldn't deter you from playing it and of course going in your accepting this is an old game.<br><br>I have never played dungeon siege or dungeon siege 2. I bought the dungeon siege collection because it was slightly cheaper than getting dungeon siege 3 and the dlc for it so as a bonus I get the original games as well. I delved right into the third game first because I planned on playing it with a friend and because I suspected as someone new to the franchise it would be the easiest to ease into being the most recent.<br><br>First the negatives. You cannot strafe in this game you can move forward or backward and turn the camera. You can move by holding down right click which to me feels odd or using w\/s and turning the camera with a\/d vs turning the camera with the mouse. Click to move wouldnt be out of the question as a suggestion for what they could of done not that i am  a big fan of click to move. There are only 2 zoom in and out settings changed with the mousewheel. If the movement felt more free and I could strafe and adjust the camera where I want it at all times with the mouse while moving with keys like in an MMO I would be in heaven. Voice acting is hit or miss. Some sound effects are either strange or of really poor quality like fireball the spell\/basic attack. Left click is the basic attack which bothers a lot of people who reviewed this game. I would of preferred an auto attack bypassing the need to a basic attack slash or spell but thats just me and it being left click frees up the 1 number key for the first special ability.<br><br>Alot of people didn't care for the talent\/skill system in this game I think its fine and this is why I play RPGs the choices involved with fleshing out my character's or characters playstyles. A RPG or MMORPG that gimps your ability to customize your character is a poor one, a lot easier said than done in MMOs where there must be a sense of balance between specializations and classes in both pve and pvp. In dungeon siege 3 you choose passive effects to amplify your abilities and what abilities you want to master. Saving your game in this title works like this you find save locations in the world. They seem to be pretty frequent at least in the beginning and it supports Steam Saves but there is no saving whenever you please or auto saves.<br><br><br>A big positive in my opinnion with this game is that instead of using health poultices and mana poultices in the middle of a fight defeated enemies drop orbs that only linger for a short time after the fighting is over that restore health or power. Attacking, blocking(not sure how you block or maybe its just  a passive stat) and taking damage builds up an empowerment that can be used to fuel a defensive ability to heal your character. Every character has an ability like this. I chose to unlock mine wisely as soon as I could. I am also choosing to focus on Crowd control with every character (knockdowns,stun effects) just because that is what I like to do when given the option.<br><br>If you want a very brief synopsis this is a poor man's dragon age that can be played online with friends. It's a smaller install file size and you cant play DA origins with other people so that gives this game some decent PROs over more critically acclaimed RPGs such as dragon age.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30645125', 'recent_short' );
