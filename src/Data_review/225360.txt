Nevertheless, I enjoyed my playthrough of the campaign.  While there is nothing inherent in this game that will \u201cwow\u201d you, it certainly isn\u2019t as bad as all the \u201cNegative Nancy\u201d types would have you believe.  In fact, it is actually pretty entertaining.<br><br>Sure the acting isn\u2019t amazing, the AI isn\u2019t hyper-intelligent, and the animations aren\u2019t perfect; but I experienced no glitches or crashing, and the gameplay felt mostly fluid and proper to me.  All of the mechanics are borrowed from other games, but they all worked properly.  Basically, some of the supplemental mechanics and cosmetic details weren\u2019t great, but I didn\u2019t find any serious problems with the core game. Maybe I\u2019m crazy, but I\u2019ll take <i>working mediocrity<\/i> over <i>polished dysfunction<\/i> any day.<br><br>Mediocrity is the key.  The game is only mediocre, but it certainly isn\u2019t bad.  If you don\u2019t have much time to play games, you possibly shouldn\u2019t invest time in this one.  There are many other games similar to this one that you should probably play instead.  But, if you play many games, enjoy stealth games, and just want something different to play: then this will offer a novel experience and story.  And as long as you don\u2019t go into it wanting to hate it (because of what you may have heard), it actually can be pretty fun.<br><br>The story is clich\u00e9, but entertaining.  It tells a compact and interesting tale of a vampire protagonist with classic \u201cheroes\u2019 amnesia,\u201d and is mildly reminiscent of other vampire stories, like: <i>Blade<\/i>, <i>Underworld<\/i>, and <i>True Blood<\/i>.  The gameplay is linear, and extremely stealth-based, where \u201cgoing loud\u201d is not really an option. There is a leveling system and various abilities\/upgrades to cater to your playstyle.  The campaign will take about 8-10 hours to complete, on average; but it can also likely be done much faster if you avoid combat.  <br><br><b>DARK<\/b> can be enjoyable. However, if you like action over story, don\u2019t like stealth, or are new to stealth, this probably isn\u2019t for you.  I recommend it to anyone who likes true stealth games and is looking to experience something different, perhaps having already played the classics.  It tells an interesting enough story, and should appeal to anyone who enjoys the narrative experience of games.  If you enjoy vampire fiction, it will probably serve as an added bonus.<br><br><i><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/murphyslawyercuration#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17164166', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17164166' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17164166\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17164166' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17164166\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17164166', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17164166_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17164166_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t553 of 862 people (64%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary873465\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"20442129\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e67b9b89444b7cec6ed54592690dc13996abdc2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e67b9b89444b7cec6ed54592690dc13996abdc2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e67b9b89444b7cec6ed54592690dc13996abdc2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"20442129\">Soundcreepy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/games\/?tab=all\">1,178 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/recommended\/\">56 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/soundcreepy\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 15, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Don't get high expectations, its made by a small 19 person team and it shows. Animation, voicing, writing, its all sub-par. That being said its pretty fun (and hard) gameplay wise. <br>2. It is not a RPG. It has small RPG elements, but its more a action\/third person stealth fighter. <br>3. Do not get at full price. At the time of this writing its on sale at 19.99, that is a decent price if you like challenging stealth games, if not, wait till it hits 10 or you will feel like you over-paid.<br><br>Just please, if you do get it, play longer than chapter 2. I see sooooo many people saying the game sucks and only making through (or to) chapter 2. If your going to knock a game, at least beat it............\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('873465', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '873465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary873465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '873465' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary873465\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '873465', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary873465_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary873465_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 57 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14215110\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">71.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDark stars Eric Bane, a newly turned vampire who wakes up in a night club called Sanctuary. In the world of Dark, those that are turned into vampire have to then drink the blood of their sires in order to complete their transformation. If they fail to do so, they become mindless beasts. Unfortunately for Eric, he can\u2019t remember anything and thus has to venture out to find out who turned him into a vampire. Until the last two levels, that\u2019s as complicated as Dark\u2019s plot gets, which is a good thing because the dialogue is terrible but in an incredibly odd and endearing way. It inadvertently makes the game less serious and a little goofy, which I found rather refreshing. Instead of getting bloated down with too many story details or an emphasis on the dark and gritty, Dark\u2019s plot is really only there to give you a reason to go to different locals and murder people.The heart of Dark\u2019s gameplay is stealth. Being such, it is not a good idea to try to play it like an action game. One of my pet peeves in modern stealth games that they enable characters too much; making it too easy to run-and-gun or bash you\u2019re way through a scenario. Dark resists this trend but does so to its own detriment. While Eric Bane may be under-powered compared to his stealthy counter-parts, he\u2019s not powerless by any means. His powers are simply all geared toward enabling him to dispatch foes stealthily and no other way. Eric can acquire or enhance a total of 16 abilities through the course of the game.Being a vampire, Eric uses blood to perform these feats and must get up close and personal in order to replenish that blood.While most of the powers in Dark require the use of said blood, Shadow Leap does not. Shadow Leap allows Eric to teleport short distances and climb ledges. Like other abilities it can be upgrade to reduce the sound made and decrease cool down time.While Dark actively rewards players for playing stealthily and staying hidden it also contains one of the sparsest check pointing systems in recent memory. In Dark checkpoints are generally only at the beginning of each room. Rooms often contain somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 enemies while some can contain as many 20. On top of that, once enemies are alerted, they stay alerted for a quite a while, making evasion or restarting from the last checkpoint the best options. Needless to say, it can get quite frustrating. Even with experience points and despite being billed as a \u201cstealth action RPG\u201d, Dark is a stealth game with a progression system. It is not an RPG. While it has some of the trappings of an RPG, none of it is very meaningful.Visually Dark is an interesting game. It is not terribly impressive technically or artistically. It employs an art-style that very reminiscent of the Crackdown games. For the most part everything is drawn as it normally would be except that everything has a black outline around it.In the end, Dark is an incredibly hard game to judge. While it may be rough around the edges, Dark is the kind of game that has heart. Yes, the animations, voice-acting and checkpoints could all use a massive overhaul but I found myself enjoying its brand of stealth.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14215110', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14215110' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14215110\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14215110' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14215110\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14215110', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14215110_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14215110_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13417643\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFlyingDill\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"83328727\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/3781c4e357b1ce5a8bade2cf624c863f1ea2cf6f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/3781c4e357b1ce5a8bade2cf624c863f1ea2cf6f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/37\/3781c4e357b1ce5a8bade2cf624c863f1ea2cf6f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFlyingDill\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83328727\">Dille<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFlyingDill\/games\/?tab=all\">789 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFlyingDill\/recommended\/\">27 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TheFlyingDill\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 17, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore I purchased this game I had set my expectation for it super low, because even the most positive reviews came to conclusions that it's a passable stealth game at best. And that's what it is. It's an mediocre stealth game.<br><br>The movement is a bit clunky, vertical movement is very limited, non-stealth combat is just stealth takedowns but with enemies shooting at you, enemy dead body physics are bad. The story is probably the worst part of the game (so if story is important for you stay as far away from this game as you can).<br><br>But when it came to actually playing the game all those things didn't get in the way of me enjoying sneaking through the shadows, peaking around corners and taking down guards one by one while their buddies don't suspect a single thing.<br><br>The only bit of the game that is above average is it's visuals (if we don't count the animations since those get real bad sometimes). The environments are nice and colorful and character designs aren't all that bad either. <br><br>In the end, DARK is not a good game. But it's also not a bad game. If you like stealth games and have nothing else to do AND this game is on sale, go for it.

From what I can tell, there are primarily two types of people that hate this game: People who paid $50 for it and stealth game enthusiasts who were looking for another stealth game to play. While stealth is the primary combat tactic in Dark, Dark should be described as a vampire game that happens to use some stealth... rather than a stealth game where you happen to be a vampire. So if you are reading this review and you don't play a lot of stealth games, but you like Vampire games, then you will probably like Dark.  Overall, this is a solid game if you can get it for $10. I would say $20, but with a 7 to 9 hour campaign, it is really hard to justify $20. Especially when you can buy Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines for $20 and it will give you 140+ hours easy. Details:<br><br>Sound:<br><br>The protagonist is voiced by Doug Cockle, the same guy who did Geralt of The Witcher series. Personally, I think he makes a great vampire: dark and mostly devoid of emotion. However, people looking for an emotional vampire that sparkles are not going to be happy. <br><br>Overall Voice audio and acting quality were fine. (English version of the game). The main issue with the voice acting came into play when you had dialogues between the Protagonist and NPCs. <br><br>The voice audio was recorded in sentences and when they played back those sentences during the game, they didn't put in any pause between them. Thus most conversations have the NPC responding way too quickly to sound natural. Like 1 gigantic run-on sentence spoken by two different people. This could probably be fixed with a patch.<br><br>Graphics: <br><br>Texture wise, Dark has a comic book like styling, with a thick black border around every object and NPC.  (Borderlands style). It gives the game a retro feel. Some people like it, some people don't. <br><br>The developers put a LOT of detail into the environments. Each map is also relatively unique: High tech sky rises, Gothic Churches, Ancient Crypts, Woods, Modern Museums, Castles... . This helps keep the game from getting old. NPC models and animations are one of the games main weakness. The models feel like they are low quality, though that may be a side effect of the texture styling.<br><br>Plot:<br><br>The plot, at a cliff notes level, was actually better than most games I have played. I don't know if that means Dark has a good story or if most video games simply have horrible plots. Unfortunately the presentation of the plot was not done as well as it could have been. I already talked about the dialogue issues above. Plot also arrives in the form of intercepted PDAs and Emails during missions (Deus Ex style). But the game has no means of accessing the old messages. And then there are a number of Bink video that summarize  events I would have rather played through than seen in a video. <br><br>Game play:<br><br>Dark is a linear, mission based game. You start off the game in a night-club called Sanctuary. Sanctuary becomes your &quot;home base&quot;, and you return to it between missions throughout the game. Within Sanctuary you find 4 other friendly vampire NPC's who give you your missions. Then you teleport off to a mission map. When the mission is over, you get a Bink video showing you a comic book like rendering of events with the protagonists voice describing what happened and then you re-appear in Sanctuary. Rinse and repeat.<br><br>The game takes about 9 hours to complete (12 if you reload a lot). <br><br>For people looking for a VTMB type game, know this: While Dark pays homage to VTMB through some of its environments and background music, it is not like VTMB at all. Dark is very linear. There is no city to wonder around in and find side-tasks. The dialogues are sparse and have no impact on the games events or ending. <br><br>Combat:<br><br>At the end of each map, you get an XP bonus equivalent to killing about 30 NPCs if you manage to complete the map without setting off an alarm. If someone so much as consciously registers your presence, that sets off an alarm. So there is big incentive to play stealth (and reload when you get caught), though technically you don't HAVE to. I played stealth and really enjoyed the combat. Then again, I do not normally play stealth games.<br><br>Other:<br><br>Game natively supports various 3D rendering modes, many of which don't even require any special hardware. Even has an option for the old school Red\/Blue movie glasses.  I suspect the game is much cooler when taking advantage of this feature.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8587363', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8587363' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8587363\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8587363' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8587363\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8587363', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8587363_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8587363_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t112 of 192 people (58%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary2380042\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46309054\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b9624875073ea608146b71644ab9c31d66c709d4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b9624875073ea608146b71644ab9c31d66c709d4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b9624875073ea608146b71644ab9c31d66c709d4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46309054\">Rascilon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/games\/?tab=all\">2,297 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/recommended\/\">165 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rascilon\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 6, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDARK is one of those titles that shows so much promise but falls just short of being a the solid stealth game it could be.  The core mechanics are actually quite enjoyable and reminiscint of the considerably better Dishonored.  Your character is easily dispatched if discovered, but has an assortment of skills that aid in remaining undetected and moving quickly.  Unfortunately the game is marred by some very poor voice acting by several of the npc characters as well as having a narrative that seems to meander while presenting dubious motivations for the main character to continue onward.  The challenge mode is a nice extra, but considerably difficult for even experienced stealth players.  Widescreen, controller steam overlay and achievements are natively supported.  DARK is a worthwhile game for fans of the genre, but probably not worth full price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('2380042', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '2380042' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary2380042\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '2380042' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary2380042\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '2380042', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary2380042_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary2380042_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29716683\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Goldes\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"220574402\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/2032f620b746a5c6ae577a27decfb6a5e68d2f5d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/2032f620b746a5c6ae577a27decfb6a5e68d2f5d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/2032f620b746a5c6ae577a27decfb6a5e68d2f5d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Goldes\/\" data-miniprofile=\"220574402\">[PG] Goldes<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Goldes\/games\/?tab=all\">775 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Goldes\/recommended\/\">19 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Goldes\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received DARK for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Stealth, stealth stealth!<\/div>Game is almost all about stealth, if you're not into it, I'd suggest not buying it.<br><br><br>Pros<br>-Geralt from witcher is a voice actor<br>-Clever stealth game, but hard<br>-Good graphics, looks like telltale (in a good way)<br>-Story line is alright<br><br>Cons:<br>-Stealth can be hard.

This game has a LOT of problems.<br><br>Firstly, there's absolutely nothing inventive about it, the stealth mechanics, amnesiac story line, revolving around vampires, you have likely seen every single thing in it in other works before, that can be fine if it's all implemented correctly, it isn't.<br><br>While is game is pretty, there's a lot of points where it seems they just decided not to fix obvious graphical issues, when Eric is running(his normal movement) and you turn, he instantly is facing the direction you wanted to turn to, yes, there is seriously no turning animation while running, it appears rather comical and completely undermines any serious moments.<br><br>The developers just seemed to not care what the dialog portions looked like, most of the points when you're talking face to face with Rose have the camera jumping around the room suddenly and frequently, it is very disorienting, there was one point when Rose was suddenly levitated off the floor for about a foot and then proceeded to land and keep talking like nothing happened. When guards rush into a room Eric will instantly teleport to a point where they can't immediately see him, but will exit stealth, I know it takes me to a place where they can't spot me instantly but I really just want to shout at Eric and tell him to stop standing up right when his enemies show up in a stealth based game.<br><br>The characters are...just there, they obviously tried to give them something to set them apart, but they end up falling into tropes anyway, the security manager at the club talks like a frat boy for some reason, I kept watching for him to try and haze me. Rose is basically your support through the game, she's not only a beautiful vampire with large breasts and only wears very revealing clothing, but is the owner of a night club AND a super hacker, immediately wants to help you with all of your troubles upon meeting you and starts flirting with you within the same night you met her(admittedly, the last two there happen in a lot of games, and movies, and everything), have you heard anything that sounds more like a nerd fantasy woman? I haven't.<br><br>The main character is an amnesiac who talks like Christian Bale's Batman, every line has to forcefully be uttered in the lowest voice possible for whatever reason, though, Deus Ex: Human Revolution had the same fault(minus the amnesiac factor) so I guess I can't really judge it on this too harshly, but there's absolutely no depth to him, he wakes up, decides to not die, that's it. EXCEPT for his reluctance to kill unarmed humanas, for some reason he's absolutely fine with slaughtering a hundred security guards, but a guy with no gun? That's morally reprehensable! There were a few guys near the end of the first area that showed they were complicit in terrible things, but you don't know that beforehand, and it certainly doesn't apply everywhere, you just kill guys that are at work. Maybe the developers were trying to make a point somewhere in there, but it just turns out hypocritical, two people hired by the same company, one given a gun, another isn't, it's fine to kill one of them, though the other is a danger too(unarmed npcs will alert armed ones if they spot you).<br><br>The writing ranges from not very good to absolutely terrible, with characters responding like someone said a different line every so often, two examples of &quot;What were they thinking when writing this?&quot; are when Eric first finds a UV lamp, he immediately calls in to Rose and asks what it is, she immediately tells him to stay far away from it, so he proceeds to stick his hand in, remark that it hurts a lot, and asks how dangerous it is. I don't understand this, my niece repeatedly wanted to touch an open flame when she was 5 years old, she has since grown out of that, the writers perhaps have not?<br><br>There's a PDA in the Geocorp building that has someone suspicious of activity in the garden area...his only proof? That it was cleaned without guests coming by, is he from Planet Slob?<br><br>While there really isn't much depth or interesting material in the story, if you're still interested in finding every little tidbit, well too bad for you, there's a bug that causes the PDAs you pick up to (very often)close instantly and prevent you from reading them, there's no codex or anything to go into in order to read collected ones either, I suppose you could just keep reloading until it decides to display the content of the PDA, but I suggest just taking XP and moving on.<br><br>As for the combat...there isn't any, it's all stealth, despite being a super fast(not really) and strong(nope) vampire(well, half-vampire) you have absolutely zero melee attacks except for biting, you never pick up guns or any other weapons, either sneak and kill them without alerting anybody or reload, because a single guy with a gun with absolutely ruin you(you are still as fragile as a normal human, I guess).<br><br>What you DO have on your side are the powers, and my god Shadow Grip is so overpowered, when fully upgraded you will instantly kill someone across the room without making any noise and the body is instantly disposed of.<br><br>Shadow Leap is your basic power, but I found it slow and lacking in range, also very difficult to target it on the position you want, I wanted to teleport down a floor off the edge of a balcony, but the cursor kept snapping to the wall nearby on the floor I was on.<br><br>Possibly the worst thing in the game is the weirdly placed invisible walls, why have them in a stealth game? Large open areas under staircases are completely impassable(despite being clearly great hiding spots), when over halfway down a staircase with no railing you aren't allowed to just walk off the side of it as a slight shortcut, I don't know why.<br><br>Another gripe I have about it is the angelic visions subplot *Spoilers* It goes absolutely nowhere, you're getting hints from this angelic figure of pure light through the course of almost the entire game, then at one point the visions change so the angel's wings are no longer connected, but segmented and floating a distance away from it, I thought this had some kind of significant meaning to it, but after two of the segmented wing angel appearances it went back to the normal angel. I had assumed at one point the M-17 organization was somehow sending Erik orders via this apparition, which was backed up by the end of the first Steiner event, but I realized the glowing white figure between the M-17 agents didn't have wings then, during all the chats with the boss lady of M-17 there's absolutely no reference to sending him messages, so it effectively opens up this big theme of the game and just never follows up. *End Spoilers*<br><br>So...yeah, this game has a large number of flaws to it, but even with that sneaking through an area really feels genuinely rewarding, my verdict is to get it if you like stealth but not if you want a story.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24385473', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24385473' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24385473\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24385473' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24385473\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24385473', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24385473_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24385473_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25629809\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/codingcoyote\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"54721972\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0b50f53e23163d1290918a227e4939df1f2725d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0b50f53e23163d1290918a227e4939df1f2725d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0b50f53e23163d1290918a227e4939df1f2725d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/codingcoyote\/\" data-miniprofile=\"54721972\">ThreadPool (Digital Coyote)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/codingcoyote\/games\/?tab=all\">751 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/codingcoyote\/recommended\/\">34 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/codingcoyote\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGot this game in a bundle that cost me about $0.60 each.

The stealth aspect at times is overly challenging (I only ever played on hard) and yet it still seems lacking. there are roughly 3 kinds of enemies and a variety of traps on each level.

The art style reminds me of TellTale games while the gameplay is a bit too rigid for a stealth game. The atmosphere is nice, the powers are fun to use however you are limited by how the game was designed. Most of the levels are very basic with just going from A to B and sneaking behind the AI which, at times, can be very funny to watch. <br><br>Overall it's a slightly above average game simply due to the fun powers that you can have and level up with a light RPG element attached to the game and the nice art style. The voices are ok and the story does feature a nice twist near the end however it is all a bit rushed.<br><br>I suggest playing this game in small bits and not all at once as it does get very repetitive.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30352910', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30352910' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30352910\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30352910' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30352910\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30352910', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30352910_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30352910_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29910279\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/flydogfish\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"67730344\">FlyDogFish<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 18.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI got this game for very cheap through a Bundle Star's Dark Reboot Bundle. I wish I payed more and bought it sooner, but all the bad reviews and low scores kept me from getting it before it got too cheap to miss.<br><br>This game just shines at gameplay. That's if you like sneaking around and killing unsuspecting enemies with your bare arms and drinking their blood. The hero must have suffered some (never mentioned) brain damage that stops him from picking up and using weapons dropped by the enemies, but that's alright, because that would make the game way too easy combined with all his awesome vampire powers. If superheroes don't need guns, why would vampires? Sure, chances of survival are very slim once you get detected, but not impossible. Anyway, the game can be pretty challenging at times and requires a lot of patience and retries because of the limited amount of saves between checkpoints, but you can always play it on easy where no such limitations exist. It does get easier once you learn how to sneak around, avoid detection, approach your enemies at appropriate times, places and angles and use your powers efficently and without attracting attention.<br><br>Cell-shading was a perfect choice for this dark vampiric world, although the atmosphere could be darker. The music is nothing special. Sounds effects and voice acting are great.

You get it on sale, give it a chance, and it turns out to be pretty good. The story is decent, the characters look, sound and act like proper characters, and the gameplay is alright.<br>The overall visual aesthetic is what drew me, as well as, you know, vampires. This game is more modern than, say, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, a lot more user-friendly, but plays much more differently. For example, you really aren't supposed to fight. Combat is bad news bears. You can't just go around exploding guys without attracting inordinate trouble. Although, that is where I feel the game struggles: you're meant to avoid all conflict, except for some mandatory fights. This means a lot of pattern memorization and trial-and-error saving. And that's alright, if you like that sort of thing, but it's considerably less forgiving than a lot of other stealth games, as, well, the enemies seem to know what they're doing.<br>Most reviews seem to be in the realm of, &quot;I played for five minutes and was repulsed.&quot; Well, to be fair, this was one of the first games I &quot;perfected&quot; on Steam, and it was worth it. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't a triple-A title, but the art style was fantastic (Especially that blood fountain. Eenf.), the graphics were pleasing, finding all the little collectables felt fairly rewarding, and the Steam rewards (Badges, Backgrounds) are hawt.<br>I'm just saying, if this is on sale, and you like dark settings mixed with pretty lights, it may appeal to you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28015238', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28015238' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28015238\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28015238' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28015238\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28015238', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28015238_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28015238_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26548744\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/KiraUsagiMomo\/recommended\/225360\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"169636841\">D i s a p p o i n t m e n t<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 21.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   Definitely good on a sale for 5 bucks plus DLC. Sad that the DLC isn't continuing off the original storyline stats. Both stories could have gone on longer, I loved this game. When I close my eyes I can still see the fighting under my eyelids. The song in the preview video is the only one in the game which just repeats itself. Had some bugs which was frustrating with the first boss. Had to get a hang of which vampire perks were the best in order to pass the game which I got the hang of on my first restart of the adventure. Had me on edge, wanting that 5 bucks to count. The ending. I need more. I cri.<br>   So, I am waiting for a Dark II please. PLEASE. And, the adventure really did take longer. I was so afraid that the first boss was the last boss and that I couldn't return to the club (like home sweet home). But no. There were, like, 4. Smooth story gameplay. Maybe a challange for battling the elder vampire, but one thing that I thought conflicted was how in controlled storymode of the game he could apparate more quickly than the stats allowed me to do. Major glitch that was horrible and a (female dog) was the click to kill mechanism. That, sometimes, the game control gave up on me when I tried to use it. Thus I was stuck using:<br><br>The Blood Capacity MAX<br><br>Shadow Grip w\/o touching the louder moves like click to hit and kill..<br><br>No confusion or other mental abilities such as distraction, confusion, which sounded cool if it actually functioned.<br><br>Having to kill only with shadow grip or feed, occassionally the right-click-to-kill when there was only one opponent left.<br><br>Treading with MAX stealth on the footwork.<br><br>Sucking with MAX stats on it to add quietness because why not.<br><br>Vampiric vision upgrades: seeing ghouls but don't need to see sensors and electricity -- they aren't invisible on my sights.<br><br>Wishing that I could control how he killed people or if he could drag the human he was drankin' from with him.<br><br><br>The shrubs saved my god dmn life -- those leaves were fkkin nanotube strong asf to have rended the bullets of the lackeys on the second boss -- useless! Too bad there weren't any more shrub-like things for the other zones. I am impressed by the castle in the museum, was really atmospheric. All the areas you gotta move around in... got their puzzles. Enjoyable and different routes may be taken in battle that way.<br><br>Also, you don't have to kill everyone when you gotta keep moving on.<br><br>I should have used my save slots more because then I could go back and go crazy by the time I finished the adventure.<br>The choices on the social interactions didn't affect the story at all.<br><br>SPOILER DISCRETION ADVISED (This is mostly for the game makers or those who have already played or don't care)<br><br>I was forced to do tutorial before leaving, also meeting the human girl with the fettish for vampires. She was nice. Enjoyed the scene where she got sucked in that VIP lounge by the main character.<br><br>OH! I wish there was a customizable character selection, or a female role. Don't make it switch during storyline, I just mean to play throughout with a customized female character along with the availability of the main.<br>That might be much to ask, but his role also sunk in well along with the dialogue. At times, laughable with how \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 serious he always was v. our buddy Tom who actually wore that vampiric tribal face tat. His voice was refreshing to talk to, though his role wasn't emphasized as much on the final boss. That's okay.<br><br>Also, it was pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 funny that on the first time you suckin on someone and all the buddies come over they cant shoot unless you try that again. &quot;Yah, u watch me.&quot; And now I think that the homeless guy in the tutorial who was backing up had it smart. I couldn't drink fast enough to get closer to him or kill my prey because I needed the blood for the meter?<br><br>It was uncermonious for what happened to Stein. How could I just accept this new random group? &quot;SO IT WAS YOU?&quot; I thought. Pfsht. That guy became HULK, he wasn't no street fighter teleportation guy from that one episode including Vega and Chun Li in Spain, and Eliza. . . so couldn't he have just dug himself out of the rummage then? The ending was easy, like, (since I played on easy mode -- thank god) since vampiric visoin stopped time and I had no trouble running away from Stein the Hulk (makes me feel more guilty having checked what happened to Rose when I tried the Revenge ending). It is certainly best when you save Rose. But what in the world was that &quot;Kiss&quot; scene? It was a hug. Did I survive? Would I not become a ghoul? Did Rose's blood save me? I really wanted a second part to this story! Could I just wreak havock in the city? Get an underground sewer home with Rose? What?<br><br>Vlad was too rich for his own good. Saving before he moved to the first place he'd appear at helped me sneak up on him even when he barely caught me and I had been holding the feed button.<br><br>No glitches on the most important moments otherwise. But choosing your own saves are the most imporant than auto saves, god! Shocking to restart the fkkin first boss adventure. Also, good, there is a fast foward. Almost fast fowarded dialogue from Rose while in a hall but that save let me hear it. What happened to Tom afterward? I only saw Rose and my main character. :\/<br><br>Anyway. That themesong? Fkk yahh I listen to it all the goddmn time now! Dancing in the club? Ehh it was good for the mood of your serious character but looking at him it's like, &quot;He must be really thirsty to be humiliating himself like this LMFAO.&quot;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26548744', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26548744' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26548744\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26548744' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26548744\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26548744', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26548744_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26548744_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/225360\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 780 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30921336","17164166","873465","14215110","13417643","8587363","2380042","29716683","24385473","25629809"]}
