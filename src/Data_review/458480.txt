Wind. Fire. Water. These are the ingredients that make up.....the <span class=\"bb_strike\">Powerpuff Girls!<\/span> Alright, that was a dumb reference! Anyway, these are the basic elements of course! Video games include them sporadically all the time, but what about a game that includes <i>all<\/i> of them? Well, let's see how it is!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Breakdown<\/div>Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is a hidden object game (HOG, for short). If you're not familiar with HOGs, essentially they're a clickfest with a story and puzzles attached. The basic gameplay consists of you clicking on objects to either collect or interact with them to progress the story. This time around, the plot is about a woman, Emma, whose uncle, Alfred, has dedicated his life to pursuing the mythical philosopher's stone. Y'know, the one that is supposed to turn basic metals into gold? Now, the game never really explains much about the stone, but I feel like that's because Artifex Mundi HOGs tend to be a bit weak in the story department.<br><br>See, this game is published by Artifex Mundi, and at least from my experience, it seems like the basic story of each of their hidden object titles is mostly the same. You play as female X and need to rescue\/find family member Y, who is probably interested in or searching for object\/location\/thing Z. Now, there's nothing wrong with this basic concept, don't get me wrong - in fact, I think it's important that more video games include female protagonists. Yet, this all just makes it feel like the game is treading familiar ground in the HOG department - if you've played one, the story won't really feel unique at all. Actually funnily enough, two Artifex Mundi HOGs I played recently were surprisingly similar in some ways to this one: Time Mysteries involves moving through various themed areas (time periods in that game and elemental-themed areas in this one), while Tibetan Quest's &quot;final boss&quot; used the same memory-based gameplay as in this game to defeat it.<br><br>Despite the &quot;hey, I've seen this all done before!&quot; feeling of the game's plot, I must compliment the game in terms of its gameplay. I've played a decent amount of hidden object games by now, but I was really surprised at the diversity of puzzles and hidden object scene types here. Usually, the types of puzzles are recycled from game to game, but there was a fair amount of new ones (to me at least) in this game. In addition to that, the hidden object scenes themselves were not only beautifully detailed but also had multiple types which surprised me a bit. Some involved the usual word lists (a bit like those &quot;I Spy&quot; books), but quite a few were different. Lists of pictures or symbols were sometimes used, which in my opinion made the scenes harder yet also helped diversify the gameplay, which was nice.<br><br>Graphically the game looks pretty beautiful, like I said earlier. The landscapes are fantastic and the hidden object scenes look great. The characters look a little strange, but I think it's hard to get a good balance between realistic-looking and cartoony, so I think the developers struck a decent balance at least. In terms of sound, the game is standard fare for a HOG: simple yet calming music and a general lack of sound effects besides affirmatives (like a little &quot;whoosh&quot; if you pick up an item or whatnot). The voice acting is nothing noteworthy in my opinion. Or at least, the protagonist just sounds pretty neutral about everything. It seems like she lacks emotion most of the time, even though [slight spoilers---&gt;]<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>it turns out we learn that her uncle isn't exactly good<\/span><\/span>. Oh, and the uncle's voice actor is a little better, but still not great.<br><br>The game is a &quot;collector's edition&quot;, like most if not all of Artifex Mundi's Steam releases. This means that the game contains a bonus chapter that's about 1-2 hours long on top of the main game, which takes around 3-5 hours to beat. The length of the game is pretty average compared to others in its genre, but I think that it's just about the perfect length. Any longer and I'd personally get bored from the repetitive nature of the gameplay, and any shorter and I'd feel like my money wouldn't be well spent. <br><br>Overall though, I enjoyed my time with Mythic Wonders. It has some problems, mainly in the &quot;samey&quot; feeling of the plot and the lackluster voice acting, but the pleasant music, lovely visuals, and interesting mechanics of the puzzles help propel it to a solid recommendation from me.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Beautiful landscapes and hidden object scenes<br><\/li><li>Decent variety in terms of gameplay: multiple creative puzzles to solve, different types of hidden object scenes to search through, and numerous item or element-based obstacles to overcome<br><\/li><li>Music is calming and fits the mood of each element-themed area<br><\/li><li>The game takes 3-5 hours to beat, but also includes a bonus chapter that's around 1-2 hours long<br><\/li><li>Steam achievements, trading cards, and cloud support for saves<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Story feels incredibly similar to many other hidden object games<br><\/li><li>Voice acting lacks emotion<\/li><\/ul><br>Gameplay-wise, Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is superb. The puzzles are varied and fairly unique, and the hidden object scenes themselves were diverse in their types of lists of objects to find. It also certainly helps that the game looks quite nice. Despite the lackluster story and uninspired voice acting, this is a great hidden object game that any fan of the genre certainly should check it out.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Final Verdict: 7\/10<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23224889', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23224889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23224889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23224889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23224889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23224889', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23224889_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23224889_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23565042\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9e93b4b42c390f9f51e1a906d093cd41babdc4dc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83462179\">morphicmetal<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/games\/?tab=all\">5,105 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/morphicmetal\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone<\/b> is a hidden object style game where you are playing the part of Emma, and upon having a nightmare about your uncle, Alfred, you go over to see if he is okay.  You and your uncle were both working on plans he had acquired on how to make a time machine, but you quickly realize things don't seem right, as Alfred has disappeared, and you must find out what has happened to him after realizing he gained access into the strange time machine.<br><br>As the story goes on, I find it a little strange and towards the end a bit off putting, the way things happen.  A lot of it does not make too much sense, and I just find it very odd.  I can't really say much more without getting into spoilers, but I am a bit confused at the way things ended, and why it ended up the way it did, and there are a lot of gaps and problems with how things led up to that, and no explanations or clarifications.<br><br>The game itself is a lot of fun though, and I enjoyed what it offered, in terms of scenery, puzzles, object hunts, and some of the more logical puzzles as well were pleasant and enjoyable.  All in all this is quite a good game for its genre, and even for somebody interested in trying a hidden object game, I'd recommend something like this for mechanics, but I would choose something else if they wanted a better story.  <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><br>Classic great Artifex Mundi art, which I thoroughly enjoy with each game I've played from them.<br><br>The music is relaxing and very good.  I also like the sound effects, and the way certain objects will move as you interact with them on the map.<br><br>There is a system of collectible finds for achievements.  Other achievements are activated as you embark on your quest.<br><br>The puzzles are always fantastic, as they always seem varied, and interesting, since you don't really know what to expect.  Some I've seen before in this maker or other similar games, and other things that are quite original, or have a unique twist put on them.<br><br>I like the big animations and motions and effects used when something happens in the game.  It is refreshing to see this when everything can be very more 2D artwork styled on a lot of hidden object games.  Mixed in just enough to add a nice bit of excitement to keep the story driving.  Lots of smaller ones too, like I mentioned above, and all of it really make the whole experience a lot more enjoyable!<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><br>I do not like the voice acting of Emma. So far it seems very detached from what is going on, with lack of emotion, sort of like it's being read, more than played out through the voice.<br><br>The hints are revealed too fast on the easiest setting, which I started on to get a feel for it.  I like to get a chance to look around at what I'm doing and not have stuff spoiled right away.  You can, fortunately change them on the fly in settings, and either raise it up, or customize it a bit more to your liking.<br><br>This can be more of a pro for some people, but it sticks a bit too close to the overall genre, and I would like a little more freedom.  It's still great, but as with many hidden objects, they are pretty linear for the most part.  Not so much a con as a personal preference, or wish for a more interesting mix.<br><br>This is a constant hidden object con:  I pick up something early in the game, then I drop it and have to get it again later!  Or, there will be multiple different things that I would do in that situation that would work, but I can only pick one proper choice that is outlined specifically.  So many tools have many uses, and some tools would something I'd keep a long time, and not drop for anything if I were exploring!<br><br>The story as it unravels boggles me, so this one is a major concern for me.  I did not like the way things shifted, and it is unsettling for me, with so many gaps and holes that are not really covered properly...  I wish I could go into detail, but that would create major spoilers.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div><br>This isn't a bad hidden object game for its genre, but I didn't like the way the story went.  It's good for a hidden object game, and for somebody very into hidden object games, I think it's worth the price it's at.  If somebody not familiar with them was feeling adventurous, I might recommend this, but would probably look for something with a better storyline.  <br><br>The core mechanics are great, as well as the animations, artwork, and music.  It's relaxing and enjoyable throughout as far as that goes.  I'd definitely recommend this to everyone except those who are extreme critics or sticklers for a strong storyline.  That for me is the biggest drawback.  Anyone who likes hidden object games should really enjoy all the small things this has to offer, and it all leads to a rewarding and fun hidden object-style experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23565042', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23565042' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23565042\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23565042' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23565042\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23565042', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23565042_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23565042_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22633157\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/83\/835a8bf9a6e4690f465536dac9fbb46125250042_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266629\">Vic=HKC=<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/games\/?tab=all\">2,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/\">343 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWaking up from a nightmare, you worry for your uncle Alfred, hoping that he didn't activate the portal you've been building together, based on ancient documents you've found. But when you arrive at this house, it seems that he crossed it and is in danger, like in your dream! Travelling from world to world, the mysterious guardian is putting obstacles so that you can't complete the artifact in your possession... but why?<br><br>Mythic Wonders is again a game picked by Artifex Mundi to be part of their publishing catalogue. While I do think that they should develop more their series as they're really good, they're good to choose their games, apart with one or two of them (but one of them was plagued with translation problems  - I should see if they're now patched). Mythic Wonders is the last at the time of the writing.<br><br>The story is very good as you're jumping from world to world, corresponding to a new power you'll acquire for the artifact. And these are needed if you want to advance: lightning to see darker areas, fire to burn obstacles, water for growing plants, etc.. I didn't really expect the twist at the end, even with the hind dropped.<br><br>The gameplay is quite standard: use items, find them, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles. The fact that you need to use logic to open the portals are also a nice idea, though I think there was a mistranlation at one moment. Besides, hidden objects scenes are also varied: list of items and shaped. But what I really liked a certain shaped type: runes. It was fun to find symbols in a scene full of them. Puzzles were easy to solve apart for one or two where I had to check a walkthrough because even with the help, I couldn't really understand it.<br><br>The graphics are quite beautiful, given the different worlds visited. They're always bright and peaceful, even when you're surrounded by lava. It's one of the best I've seen in the Artifex Mundi world. And the soundtrack was also quite good.<br><br>It's also a collector's edition, meaning an extra chapter in the shoes of an ancestor at the time of the creation of the guardian, concept arts, etc..<br><br>Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is really one of the gems in Artifex Mundi's catalogue. A very good story, nice landscapes, good gameplay, why ask for more? This is a must-have for hidden objects and casual lovers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22633157', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22633157' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22633157\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22633157' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22633157\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22633157', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22633157_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22633157_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25135371\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"82565658\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82565658\">talgaby<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/games\/?tab=all\">425 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/recommended\/\">354 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Short version: 74%<\/div>Mythic Wonders does a good job at delivering a modern fantasy tale with some sci-fi elements in the mix, but it feels a little dated for a hidden object game, despite its 2014 release.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Long version:<\/div>After playing Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this is some attempt at a high-definition remake of an early 2010 hidden object game. But no; this is an early 2014 title that can be either considered a little dated for its age\u2014or pleasantly nostalgic about that short period where the usual HOG tropes still didn\u2019t fully bloom yet.<br><br>To make it more clear: the story follows the usual clich\u00e9 of a female protagonist who tries to find her missing relative in a fantasy world\u2014where she collects the power of the four (plus one) elements\u2014but the story is less predictable than most would think, and the visual style is a lot closer to 1980s sci-fi\/fantasy than the usual enchanted forest backdrop.<br><br>The dated feel is also present in picture quality and the reliance of simple puzzles, needlessly complicated item gathering, and the surprisingly challenging hidden object scenes. The latter have three different versions, so at there won\u2019t be any complaints about variety, even if the game may seem a bit boring for newer players.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25135371', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25135371' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25135371\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25135371' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25135371\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25135371', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25135371_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25135371_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23522763\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/06a7a8fa92dd2d46e57e9f648e787b0d2e81b714_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/\" data-miniprofile=\"122729416\">Orge Lambart<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/games\/?tab=all\">7,713 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/\">109 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/orgelambart\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn regards to Artifex Mundi games the old saying, if something isn't broken, don't try to fix it comes to mind.  AM has found a casually fun formula that works on all their games.  While the games are similar and have a similar story-line, so and so is missing, this person tries to find them and hilarity and hidden object games aplenty follow..  If you've played one Arifex game you've played them all, yet they all continue to be good casual games with similar but unique enough to have their own telling.  The meat and potatoes of an Artifex Mundi game are the puzzles in particular the hidden object puzzles.  Spend a few minutes to an hour searching an interactive picture trying to find hidden items.  Many of them humorous, a few necessary to  continue along the storyline. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> The Story <\/div><br>You play the game as Emma, a woman searching for her uncle Alfred.  The two had been trying to recreate a mysterious machine from a set of Ancient plans they found.  Emma was called away for a while while Alfred stayed behind to tinker with the machine.  After failing to receive word from her Uncle she fears for his safety and rushes back to see what happened.  Upon arriving back at her Uncles location she finds the machine has activated and her uncle may be trapped inside.  The game consist of numerous worlds which the portal\/machine can take you too.  Each world is hand drawn and quite beautiful to look at.  The hidden object puzzles are fun as always and generally I had alot of fun with this Artifex game like every other one I've played.  <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay <\/div><br>Nothing too unique here, many of the puzzles were repeated from previous games (only updated to fit this game), although AM seemed to expand a bit and introduce some new mechanics which weren't present in previous games, overall the gameplay ranges from easy to mildly challenging, any fan of HOG's will be fully versed in how the game works.  Those new to the format may struggle a bit to figure out how things work.  *pro tip  -  If you are stuck, explore every area you have access too*, you will be doing lots of back and forth traveling in the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros <\/div><br>Beautiful hand drawn art<br>Casual pick up and play game<br>relaxing music, which doesn't get repetitive<br>The usual steam works which all AM games have (the cards in particular unlock some nice backgrounds, they always retain value unlike many other games)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Cons <\/div><br>The story is nearly a clone of every other AM game, which may be a con for some people, I felt it was unique enough to warrent still play the game<br>Character voices were slightly cheesy <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> The Recommendation <\/div><br>If you are a fan of HOG's or hidden object games in general, you should buy this game, it'll give you a new setting, new story line and new puzzles to fill up a few house out of your day.  Although keep in mind if you play alot of AM games back to back things may seem slightly on the repetitive side.  In all honesty if you space out your play times and don't go overboard in a short period of time the game\/games will be nice casual fun, you can pick up and play at any time.  Enjoy it at your own pace, when you're taking a break from one of your more intense games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23522763', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23522763' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23522763\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23522763' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23522763\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23522763', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23522763_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23522763_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26166692\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thalatte\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"67159044\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/8806831203603509787ee5c01901be8f45f4a7a7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/8806831203603509787ee5c01901be8f45f4a7a7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/8806831203603509787ee5c01901be8f45f4a7a7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thalatte\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67159044\">Thalatte<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thalatte\/games\/?tab=all\">407 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thalatte\/recommended\/\">70 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thalatte\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"><u>Game Information<\/u><\/div><br>Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone [CE*], is a HOPA* game, developed by Organic 2 Digital and published by Artifex Mundi<br><br>*CE - Collector's Edition<br>*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.<br><br>Since this is an collector's edition game, it comes with some extra features, that aren't available in the regular edition game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u>Game Visuals<\/u><\/div><br>I want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done.

Step into the shoes of Emma as she tries to find her uncle but unwittingly gets dragged into a magical adventure. This game is beautifully done with a lot of unique puzzles and hidden object scenes to keep you busy. Are you ready to find the Philosopher\u2019s Stone?<br><br>Emma and her uncle have been working on a magical portal but one night she is awoken by a nightmare and fears her uncle is in danger. What she finds when she arrives is an empty house- and that he has gotten the portal to work. She steps through the looking glass and enters new and wondrous lands on her search to find him. Throughout your journey you will find clues about your uncle as well as get ominous warnings from the enigmatic Guardian. With the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in hand, you bend nature to your will and solve the mysteries surrounding your uncle\u2019s disappearance.<br><br>This title is a point and click game, you use your mouse to walk, select objects, talk to people and interact with the scenes. As you travel through the game you will have to get through many puzzles, most range from easy to moderate in terms of difficulty. There are also hidden object scenes as well.  They are the traditional type: A list of items that you have to find as well ones where you see the shape of the object you\u2019re looking for and have to find it in the scene. I found the variety very pleasant and felt that it kept things fresh. There are also \u201cmorphing objects\u201d to find as you travel along, as their name suggests they morph from one shape to another and can be hard to spot at times.<br><br>Visually the game is gorgeous, lovely backgrounds, well done hidden object scenes though some require a bit of squinting. The user interface is also well done, matching the aesthetics of the game. The animation of the characters in the game is decent but it could be better, movements are stiff and mouth movements are underwhelming. The game also uses music that fits each scene, helping to create a very mystical vibe or adding to the drama where it\u2019s needed.<br><br>I was very pleased with <i>Mythic Wonders The Philosopher's Stone<\/i>, despite any flaws I may have found it\u2019s overall a lovely game. Since this is the collector\u2019s addition you also have an added bonus chapter as well, extending your game play. Replayable hidden object scenes and mini games are also apart of the bonus content, as well as concept art, wallpapers and music. There are also Steam achievements and trading cards to enjoy making this a well-rounded game to add to your library.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/lunarproduction.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Lunar Productions<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22905497', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22905497' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22905497\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22905497' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22905497\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22905497', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22905497_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22905497_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23789024\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sbszine\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"165560331\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5f\/5f2b13973ad36928a9ad1a224b1f3e179678b3f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5f\/5f2b13973ad36928a9ad1a224b1f3e179678b3f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5f\/5f2b13973ad36928a9ad1a224b1f3e179678b3f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sbszine\/\" data-miniprofile=\"165560331\">sbszine<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sbszine\/games\/?tab=all\">571 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sbszine\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sbszine\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn unusally good HOG from a slightly different bunch of Poles. On expert mode it's admirably low on condescension and hand holding, leaving you to figure out puzzles for yourself. There's also very little of the usual busywork -- for example, if you find a 10 digit safe combination on a bit of paper, it enters the combination for you when you click on the safe rather than forcing you to spin ten tiny wheels. Other cool things: you never revisit an HO scene, you can set a custom difficulty, there are no FROG scenes, your 'animal companion' thingo has multiple abilities, and there are no achievements for playing mahjong or something instead of the HO scenes. On top of that you get all the mod cons like fast travel, 'illusive objects', and a postgame. Recommended for HOG nerds.<br><br>Oh, and there's no tedious child in need of rescue!

Great art, well-done HO scenes, good variety and difficulty-range of puzzles, a decent story arc, and a quality, bug-free bonus chapter (a rarity in itself). Suffers from long loading times between scenes, but despite that it's still worth playing. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story<\/div>You're best buds with your uncle, with whom you've been building some sort of interdimensional gateway. He gets into trouble with an ethereal 'guardian' when he goes dimension-hopping without you, and you decide to go after him. The various worlds you travel to are each themed around a single 'element' (water, fire, earth, air, etc.), which in turn powers up an artifact you tote around that can do related things like make plants grow, create water, burn stuff, and so on. As you follow your uncle's trail, you learn more about why he's there and what he's doing, which culminates in a mild but fitting twist. The bonus chapter is set in the past, and about how the guardian came into existence in the first place.<br><br>The plotline of Mythic Wonders isn't perfect and won't win any awards for unique ideas, but it's presented well, offers some level of closure, and features the least amount of corniness and &quot;stupid protagonist syndrome&quot; that can probably be managed in these types of games. In a genre where putting together a decent story arc seems to somehow be more difficult than rocket science, it's always a pleasant surprise to find a game that hits most, if not all of the marks.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">HOGs\/Puzzles<\/div>I liked what they did with the HOGs in this game. There are the typical text and image lists, but they throw in a twist on the silhouette mode: several scenes feature not item silhouettes, but symbols. Zodiac signs, runes, planet outlines, that kind of thing. The signs and shapes are scattered over the scene like a texture, yet placed in ways they actually blend in. It was a little weird at first, but ended up being a nice change of pace. Scenes are also well-constructed, with many objects actually being a bit of a challenge to find. Also each scene is only visited once, which is always nice to see. I only caught a couple of oddly-named list items (like &quot;wall painting&quot; referring to a disc that's part of a wall puzzle), but otherwise it seems like the devs were comfortable with English, or at least had a very good translator.<br><br>The puzzles and minigames are varied, with some unique ones I haven't seen in HOPAs before (or at least the way they're done here). The difficulty level is also pretty well thought out, as I had only one or two instances of solving something by sheer accident. The majority of puzzles require actual thought or planning, but not to the point of frustration.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>The overall gameplay is pretty smooth when it comes to P&amp;C elements, but actions, item usage, or places to go are not always intuitive. They do usually make sense once you figure them out, but sometimes it takes pure trial and error.<br><br>If you play on the easiest difficulty setting, the game points out active areas and items WAY too frequently to the point of being disruptive and 'spoilery'. Changing the difficulty to Advanced should offer a much better experience. <br><br>Minigames and puzzles don't immediately display text explaining what you're supposed to do. It's nicely unobtrusive for those familiar with the rules and mechanics of Artifex Mundi's typical puzzle fodder, so if you've played a bunch of their other games, you'll probably recognize what to do right away. Otherwise you can read instructions via the &quot;Info&quot; button on the toolbar.<br><br>&quot;Safe combination&quot; style puzzles often enter the numbers or symbols for you once you've found the solution, which cuts down on the tedium of keypad button-pressing.<br><br>2 major complaints (more annoying than game-breaking):<br><br><b>Frequent lag during scene transitions.<\/b> <br>There's no &quot;loading screen&quot; per se, but the game lags terribly when you start and end HOGs\/puzzles\/minigames or move to a different location (even one you've already visited). You're left staring at a black screen with just the game cursor for about 5 seconds. I could <i>maybe<\/i> let that slide if it was limited to cutscenes or moving between worlds, but it's literally every time you move or change screens in any way. There's no excuse for a 2D game to have that much of a slowdown these days. And I know it's not my rig, because I can play far more demanding titles on ultra settings and not drop below 60fps. YMMV, but I'd expect long loading times going in. The issue may or may not be patched, judging by the patch rate of previous games with similar issues.<br><br><b>Badly-synced cutscenes.<\/b><br>It's one thing to have subtitles and voiceovers not match up correctly, but when the cutscene animations are <i>also<\/i> unsynchronized, it becomes very difficult to follow the intended story progression. Subtitles can't seem to keep up with the voiceovers, and the visuals trudge behind both. It's not a problem in every cutscene, but enough of them to be bothersome. It's particularly problematic during the confrontation with your uncle at the end, as well as the intro to the bonus chapter.<br><br>The 'boss fight' memory game at the end is a little odd considering it features health bars, but it's generous regarding mistakes.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div>Lovely and richly-detailed backgrounds, nice character design, well-made puzzle and HOG scenes, great effects. I found myself taking a lot of &quot;ooh, pretty&quot; types of screenshots, so that should say something. Cutscenes were fuzzy in comparison, but that seems to be pretty common in the genre.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div>Fitting soundtrack, satisfying SFX. No problems other than the handful of desynced cutscenes. Voiceovers were a mixed bag. Good for the genre, but not the best I've heard. The guardian sounds oddly casual and contemporary, the protagonist's comments are either strained or emotionless, and the alchemist in the bonus chapter is nowhere near the same calibre as the others. Nothing that makes a negative impact though.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Thoughts<\/div>Mythic Wonders is a good example of what a HOPA can be with enough care and attention to detail. It's also the kind of game I've come to expect from Artifex Mundi's growing catalog. Even with the annoying load times, I'd still say it was a good experience, and definitely recommend checking it out when you get the chance.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24550298', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24550298' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24550298\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24550298' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24550298\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24550298', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24550298_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24550298_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30690127\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dewspider\/recommended\/458480\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"142073348\">dewspider<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 10.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love HOG and played a ton of them but this is one of the best!

If you've played one of these you've played, well, most. I say &quot;most&quot; because I found this one to be very lacking and inferior to other hidden object games. <br><br>The positives are what you'd find in any HO game: lots of gorgeous, hand-drawn images, fitting music, puzzles, challenges, etc. This particular game is more enjoyable than more because you can get all of the achievements in one playthrough whereas a lot require you to play through twice to get everything. (I'm looking at you specifically, Harmonia Mundi, with your BS achievements to solve all HO games but then solve all Mahjongg games, which is impossible in one playthrough!) I found it to be relatively bug-free although it does NOT appreciate when you alt-tab to another application.<br><br>However, the main storyline left so many questions that never got solved in the bonus area. Don't misunderstand me. HO games rarely have deep plots; but this was lacking even more than that. I can't say more without spoilers, but the main villain in this effectively came out of nowhere with no explanation for his actions. That's the biggest example.<br><br>But the voice acting.... holy sweet jumping Jesus! BOTH of the leading ladies' (assuming that they were different actresses) are HORRIBLE! They define the term &quot;wooden acting&quot;! In fact, I wonder if the term &quot;acting&quot; can really apply. There are a lot of HO games out there with actors who at least put in an effort to perform the lines with some degree of accuracy. Not here! &quot;Oh, golly. I'm going to read my lines as though I really don't want to be here and I'm severely caffeine deficient and I just want to go to sleep.&quot; Bad, bad, BAD!<br><br>I won't say that I don't recommend this because there actually are worse HO games out there -- even worse voice acting, bugs out the wazoo, and so forth. But be aware that you will probably be scratching your head at the ending and the lead VO &quot;actresses&quot; are really bad.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25898014', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25898014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25898014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25898014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25898014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25898014', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25898014_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25898014_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/458480\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 99 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30498705","23224889","23565042","22633157","25135371","23522763","26166692","22905497","23789024","24550298"]}
