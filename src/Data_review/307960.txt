I look at the negative reviews and have to say GUYS THIS ISN'T WAR THUNDER.  GO BUY YOU A LOGITECH EXTREME 3d PRO FOR $40 FFS. <br><br>Complaint of &quot;Keyboard and mouse isn't good&quot; is probably coming from War Thunder wannabe's who are used to making accurate shots at 1km+ and the instructor flying the plane for them.   Guess what.. nobody flew ww2 planes with a mouse in real life.  Aiming requires getting close to your target, although you might get the lucky 800 meter shot given the right circumstances, some careful thought into how you're aiming and little luck.  <br><br>That being said - the single player AI need work, more radio commands to make flying without labels viable imo.  PWCG pretty much covers the rest of your needs for anything single player. <br><br>The game uses dedicated servers.. AWESOME.   You can build your own missions for multiplayer..there are servers with labels on.. there are expert servers.  Make friends though as flying alone is almost guaranteed to get you killed.   <br><br>I do not own the steam version, so my hours played will not be accurate.. but this is currently the sim I play the most.<br><br>The IL-2 BoS Production\/dev team is a small group of people compared to big name gaming companies out there and these devs regularly reply in the forums.. provide updates and while I believe they could improve upon the base game a bit more to attract newer players rather than push out more purchasable content... I have hope that eventually this game will be everything I could want from a ww2 flight sim. <br><br>But yeah.. definitely get at least a cheap joystick.. although best experienced with rudder pedals\/ stick\/throttle and TrackIR.  VR is being implemented soon. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30442054', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30442054' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30442054\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30442054' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30442054\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30442054', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30442054_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30442054_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30636384\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970420286\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10154558\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d9\/d92b6c7de9a88a7bdab731b97dddb7f308a7b542.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d9\/d92b6c7de9a88a7bdab731b97dddb7f308a7b542.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d9\/d92b6c7de9a88a7bdab731b97dddb7f308a7b542_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970420286\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10154558\">EURO<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970420286\/games\/?tab=all\">95 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970420286\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970420286\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">77.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like this flight sim, it has developed well over time.

This might allow his wingman to get on your tail as you fly a vulnerable slower speed.  The FW 190 A5 was the finest, fastest, piston engine plane of WW2.  It could turn on a dime, but turn too tight, too long and you'll slow down and stall... without at least 700 meters of altitude under you won't  be able to dive, pick up speed and pull-out in time.  How much should you lead your aim using your machine guns and 20mm cannons.  Your eyes and brain have to predict speed, maneuvers and flight skills to get your adversary in your sights taking into consideration the fact that you could crash into his tail, or forget to check your six as his wingman swings in behind you.  Yes, it takes quite a number of hours to master the skills necessary to survive a Campaign.  Fly a variety of planes against other planes and ground targets.  The fun is endless.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30629360', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30629360' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30629360\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30629360' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30629360\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30629360', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30629360_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30629360_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30490040\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073098133\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"112832405\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3929b0cbe007ace676549e00fd2f6fe4fb834e46.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3929b0cbe007ace676549e00fd2f6fe4fb834e46.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/3929b0cbe007ace676549e00fd2f6fe4fb834e46_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073098133\/\" data-miniprofile=\"112832405\">TrackAttack [NL]<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073098133\/games\/?tab=all\">25 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073098133\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198073098133\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">65.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat game!

IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a true flight simulator with realistic aerodynamics, wind, bullet trajectories, bullet velocities, engine management, etc. You don't necessarily need to be a pilot to be able to do things in this game, but it'll take you some time to understand some of the basic flight physics that are modeled into the game. However, that first lift off that you accomplish will feel like a real accomplishment, and that's what this game is about.<br><br>Before I get into my review session, let me clarify why there are a lot of negative reviews for this game. I'm a founder, and bought the game while it was in early access. I then had the key transferred over to steam so that I could have all of my games in one place. When the game first came out, there was a lot of things lacking. The flight models still needed some work, and the grind to get camos and modifications was pretty hard. However, the studio has fixed the problems with the flight models for the most part, and they're very active within the community on their own forums.<br><br>There are two versions of this game: the standard and the deluxe version. The only difference is that the deluxe version comes with two more planes: the Focke-Wulf 190 A3 and the La 5 series 8, and it also gives you all of the unlocks for the planes right off of the bat. Neither of these planes are the best of the best. I find that the skill level of the pilot is what decides who wins what engagement. I've had countless of battles with the FW 190 and the La 5 and still came out on top. <br><br>The campaign in this game is pretty lackluster, but this is more of a multiplayer game, anyways. There are two parts: the initial part of the Battle of Stalingrad where the Germans are forcing their way in, and the second part where the Russians use a pincer maneuver to encircle the German forces. Within each part, there are three sections that chop the part up into smaller pieces to give a sense of advancement. You select a section which then brings you to a map. You select an airport where you want to start from. You have the option to choose either normal or expert mode and also whether you want the mission to be short or long. Normal mode is basically arcade mode. You don't have to worry about your engine management; the game will throttle itself for you and manage the radiators so you don't kill your engine in mid flight. You also have a HUD on your screen that shows you a map, gives you your indicated air speed and alitude, and marks everything friendly with a blue dot above it and anything enemy with a red dot. It also shows you how far out you are as well. In expert mode, everything is gone. You have to look at your gauges to see how high you are and how fast you're going. You have to look at your coolant temperature and oil temperature to keep from overheating your engine. If either ones gets too high or too low, you have to open or close your water and oil radiators. There are no markers that show where your enemy is, so you have to scan the sky for black dots or scan the ground for smoke trails that come from trains or tracers that come from artillery positions. The main difference between a short and long mission is that you have to take off and land on a long mission, while a short mission will start you up in the air pretty close to your target. You don't have to land on a short mission, but you have to fly through an &quot;exit point&quot; to clear the mission.<br><br>Each plane has its own flight model that is very accurate. Each plane has different stall characteristics, engine management characteristics, etc. A good example is the Stuka. Its engine can't take sudden throttle changes, so if you cut the throttle really fast for a dive bombing run and then shove it back up when you go to climb, your engine will sputter and die. In the BF 109, if you run the throttle at 2600 RPM at 1.4 engine manifold pressure for over a minute, the engine will start to choke causing the plane to shake, sputter, and die.<br><br>Damage models are pretty realistic as well. You can't shoot down a bomber from its six o' clock (why would you?) because the gunners will shoot you straight in the engine with their machinegun. Depending upon where it hits, you'll either have a critical oil system failure which will cause your windshield to get coated in oil and the engine to eventually die, you'll fly off safe and sound, and anything in between. When it comes to this game, one bullet in the right place is all it takes to take down a plane.<br><br>The multiplayer is really what this game is about. Unfortunately, in America, I don't seem to be able to find many players playing on our servers. Instead, I have to go to European servers to play with people. However, I don't experience any lag or rubber banding.<br><br>There is another game that is coming out soon in March called IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Moscow. Like this game, it's centered around one specific battle. The Battle of Moscow occurred earlier than the Battle of Stalingrad, so you'll be flying earlier versions of the aircraft such as the BF 109F2, I-16, BF 110, MiG 3, etc.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19900476', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19900476' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19900476\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19900476' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19900476\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19900476', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19900476_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19900476_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t212 of 272 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13520223\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970521889\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10256161\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ec\/ec6448d9368de311bc3f46e19e2de1b4490f558e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ec\/ec6448d9368de311bc3f46e19e2de1b4490f558e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ec\/ec6448d9368de311bc3f46e19e2de1b4490f558e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970521889\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10256161\">Trupobaw<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970521889\/games\/?tab=all\">91 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970521889\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970521889\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">143.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 22, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWritten in December 2014, the game is in contant development and I expect it to be geting only better. *Year after this was written, I'm adding some comments to keep it up to date*<br><br>I wanted to start by saying it's unpolished gem, but it's not. It's a highly polished gem, fitted into cheap mass produced jevelry and wrapped in gift bag bough on discount last January. If you want realistic flying experience, don't miss it. If you want to treat yourself seriously as a simmer, you may find out-of-cockpit parts of game not dignified enough *Still mostly true, although quality of jewelry is much better*.<br><br>The good: The sim part (simulating planes and their enviroment) is very good - the game is great stick and rudder experience, the planes have mass and inertia, when flying them on the edge of flight envelope you feel them sliding from course, rather than being pushed to the side along set vector with randomized shaking added. The AI planes use the same physics as player, so they don't take breaks from reality and pretend they are jets when pressed to hard. Par the course, some people find flight models unrealistic or simply not what they expected. There are no clickable cockpits like in CloD or DCS, but after automated engine start you get to control most of plane systems (IMHO the biggest missing part is no manual fuel tank selection). To me it has the best feeling of &quot;being there&quot; of all WW2 planes, but I'm stick and rudder fetishist, not clickable cockpit fetishist. There are no stability problems, unfinished plane systems of weird flight behaviour.<br><br>The bad: There are ten flyable plane types in the game (*Battle of Moscow will bring ten more, five already done, that BoS owners can meet in air even without owning BoM*). More are in the works, but because of sim part being detailed like I said above, making new planes is slow process. Do not expect to see tens of flyables soon, or variants of the same model (like all Bf-109F variants) made by small modifications of existing plane. There are *no* AI-only planes (one *has been made since review was written*) because, as they use realistic flight physics, they are not easy to make, either. You won't see tens upon tens of computer-controled planes in misisons, either, they are to CPU-hungry for that. The number of players in MP missions is limited (*much less now than year ago*) , devs still work on optimising support of more players in mission as I write. The single player part, or campaign, is something in between proper career from IL-2:1946 and mission generator - you pick stage of the battle, airfield you take off from, plane, mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, bombing, close air support) and off you go. Missions are generated randomly with variety of weathers and targets, but they aren't as immersive as real career missions - maybe because you get no background on what your target is and why it's important beyond &quot;go and bomb that bridge&quot;. There are difficulty settings in game, but in campaign you can use only two presets, normal (icons and automated engine management) and expert (realistic). Instead of adjusting realism settings before mission, you disable unrealistic aids in flight by key command (say, I bound a key that turns all engine helpers off and hit it at start of each mission, to fly with manual engine management but icons on). *The third party PWCG, a full blown career generator, is coming and already playable*.The mission editor is quite complicated so there isn't flood of user-made content and multiplayer servers - but what community made so far was of very good quality. <br><br>The ugly: The most hated part, which caused many people to give up the game as arcade: the plane modifications (bombs for fighters, bigger cannons, armoured windscreens etc) are unlockable - you get them by flying the plane in question in single player campaign. Most of these mods are non-standard, experimantal, or one-off modifications, but few are standard-issue systems that you can't accss from the start. *Owners of Premium edition - all 10 planes - can now disable the dreaded unlocks with one mouse click*. Also, the campaign includes game elements like experience and player &quot;level&quot; (the higher it is, the more dangerous becomes opposition and flak fire in campaign. I suppose it is meant to make game easy for new sim players and progress as they succeed and learn). Then, you can start the mission in the air, half way towards the target, and abort it on reaxching &quot;exit&quot; waypoint - takeoff and landing are optional - and on lower player levels thare is little action outside target area. So the first impression is that missions consist of going to action point, doing your job, going back. It's not the case, but you have to bother playing through simpler missions to make things more interesting. These are pointless additions to otherwise purebreed sim, and many people can't get past it - some play multiplayer only and don't want to play campaign at all, some call it pointless grinding, some are so experienced they want difficult missions from the start and give campign up as to easy before they rise their pilot level and get to difficult stuff. Make no mistake, once you sit in the cockpit you get a proper sim experience, and once you get your unlocks and rise level to get interesting missions you just have a good mission generator to play with forever, no limits - but the awards that are supposed to motivate players to play are something out of console game.<br><br>There are smaller bad decisions, like locking most of graphics options to four preset settings - you don't get to set manually drawing distance for objects or super sampling, you choose high, low, medium, ultra setting and that's it. You have manual control of resolution and antialiasing, though. It made some sense in development, but is pointless now * and has been made more workable with more options to customise your settings some time after review was written*.<br><br>All these are *were* pointless design decisions that nobody i know likes, but the developers stay by them *until they fixed them*. This stubborness earned them lot of enemity and made many people abandon the game *still true*, but I have to say dev team is very cooperative with community in most other respects, adding elements requested by players and listening to suggestions of flight model changes. There was some rush to release the game on deadline, so maybe they will replace it with something better once team catches they breath *they did*. Or not. *Or they add option to drive tanks*.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13520223', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13520223' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13520223\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13520223' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13520223\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13520223', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13520223_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13520223_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t208 of 281 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11733708\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"85140178\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51b38f554c9a3fc33bf32719ff14b1795deb0767.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51b38f554c9a3fc33bf32719ff14b1795deb0767.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/51b38f554c9a3fc33bf32719ff14b1795deb0767_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85140178\">startrekmike<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/games\/?tab=all\">253 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/startrekmike\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 15, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have been playing this sim since about five months ago via early access so what I will say here is really only based on that experience and not with the final product, if it is possible to edit\/update my review once the final release occurs in September, I will be sure to do so.<br><br>  1.) first impressions.<br><br>   The menu\/UI is slick and easy to work with, not a lot of fussing about is required to do anything at all and it is quick to get from your desktop to the cockpit. The overall menu presentation is pretty nice as well with the hanger containing your aircraft (the last one you flew with), this is not unlike 777's previous sim Rise of flight with it's museum backdrop with your aircraft in it.<br><br>   Setting up controls was pretty straightforward and will be easy for anyone with any exprience in simulations previously or even War thunder, in fact, it shares some interesting ideas in terms of control binding with War thunder (in a good way).<br><br>  Setting up the visual options is pretty basic with presets, I am not sure if this is going to be a permanent thing and sadly I suspect this will be something that really gets hit hard from those that are arbitrarily judging games based on the video options (due to some influence from certain youtube personalities).<br><br>   2.) The visuals.<br><br>   Visually this sim is stunning, the snowy backdrop may not be the most colorful or feature rich but it looks very impressive, easily giving you a sense of immersion, you will almost feel like you need a hot cup of coffee after flying your first sortie, it really does give the impression of winter very well.<br><br>  The terrain itself is very highly detailed despite it's rather sparse nature, the snow is not just a flat texture but instead gives the impression of varying depths and snowbacks.<br><br>  The Sky is very nice, the lighting helps sell the winter setting with a bright, cool sunlight that you would expect from that season, the cloud effects are probably the best I have ever seen in a sim with amazing effects as you fly through them, it really gives the whole thing a dramatic feeling when you set the flight time to early dawn or dusk as the colors get very beautiful.<br><br>  The aircraft models are fantastic, they are detailed and well animated with rather impressive texture work, including a really nice reflection effect off the metal (this highlights very well that some aircraft were not entirely metal but instead had some fabric or wood parts). Additionally, the damage effects are great, the billowing smoke when you cause a fire is the most convincing I have seen in a sim and the fire effects are second to none at this point.<br><br>  3.) Gameplay.<br><br>  Like Rise of flight before it, IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is a survey sim first and foremost, it is not trying to be DCS WWII or anything like that, nor is it trying to be very arcade like War thunder or Birds of prey, it's realism is found in it's flight models, weapon strength and damage models but like Rise of flight, you don't have a clickable cockpit or anything like that.<br> <br> One thing to note very clearly however, you still need to manage your engine and it's cooling systems, these controls are not handled with your mouse in the cockpit but instead you bind these controls to your flight stick\/throttle so you can easily access and manage them in combat. Additionally, the methods you use to manage your engine\/cooling are realistic, you need to understand your aircraft's limits before you hop in the cockpit or else you will be blowing engines all over the place due to neglect.<br><br>  The combat is the real star of the show (as it should be in a WWII air combat sim), the action feels fast, brutal and visceral, this is punctuated by the brutally effective weapons at your disposal, you will be knocking down aircraft pretty quickly due to the way these planes were armed (usually with a cannon through the nose cone and two machine guns on top of the nose), it will only take a few bursts to utterly trash a opponents aircraft.<br><br>  One final note on gameplay, the feeling of flight (as I mentioned before) is something really special here, the sound, the control responses and the visuals all combine to really sell you the idea that you are flying in a aircraft, it just feels right in a way that is difficult to describe.<br><br>  <br>  4.) The game modes.<br><br>  This is a spot that will expand greatly as the game reaches completion, as it stands, you only have quick battle mode and some pretty limited online modes to choose from, this is understandable since these servers really only exist for testing and not for varied gameplay.<br><br>  Once the mission editor is made available publicly (something that will happen despite what some have said on the forums), there will be a great deal more available for both single and multiplayer gamers.<br><br>  The campaign mode is not yet implemented but it is probably coming soon to early access in some form or another, if it is like they describe, it will offer a good, historical experience that will span specific phases of the Battle of Stalingrad in a realistic way.<br><br>  5.) Final thoughts.<br><br>  I can understand the feelings that some may have when they visit the store-page and see the price and the &quot;DLC&quot; but it is important to note that in the flight simulation market, this price is indeed not only fair but very much business as usual, the seemingly high price comes from the fact that flight simulations are a extremely niche genre with a relatively small built in user-base, this is why IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is not price the same as you might find from a more mainstream genre game, it is the only way that they can make enough money to justify the continued work on it.<br><br>  As far as the &quot;DLC&quot; goes, it was made clear on the forums by the dev's some time ago that the extra planes were added as a fun extra for those willing to get the premium edition, they were not &quot;removed&quot; from the main game at all since they did not even serve in the Battle of Stalingrad anyway. More to the point, they are not &quot;Pay to win&quot; since they are not really the best aircraft anyway.<br> <br> Those that are complaining about the extra planes should keep in mind that they were never really part of the main game anyway, they were simply a extra for the premium buyers, they are not objectively better, they are not &quot;pay to win&quot; they are just like any other premium edition of a game with extra content.<br><br>   As a flight sim enthusiast first and foremost, I can happily say that this sim brings back a lot of the fun that one could find in IL-2 1946 while still offering a experience deep enough to keep DCS players intrigued.<br><br>  If you like flight sims, if you like interesting multiplayer opportunities or even just the Eastern front air war in general, this is a great sim that will give you hours of fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11733708', 'summary' );

In IL-2 Sturmovik: BoS you take control of WWII planes from both the Russian side and the German side of the fighting that took place during the Battle of Stalingrad. You pilot these aircraft on missions ranging from intercepting enemy bombers to taking out artillery or even war trains.<br><br>IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad excels at being a great simulation, sadly it fails at being an enjoyable game for the most part so I would suggest only getting this if you're serious about flight sims. Before I get started I'd just like to point out I played this entirely with a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flightstick, the controls are pretty complex and planes are difficult to handle even with a flightstick so if you're a KB&amp;M only player you might want to think about getting a flightstick to play this.<br><br>IL-2 Sturmovik: BoS is certainly a game which has mixed reviews on the store page but, despite it's issues, I enjoyed playing it and at the end of the day that's what matters. <br><br>+Gorgeous graphics, even on medium settings everything looks great<br>+Excellent aircraft models<br>+Fantastic, realistic physics and fully customisable realism settings though even on relatively low realism settings the physics still feel real<br>+Great and importantly accurate plane damage models<br>+Has a campaign mode, pre-made missions, quick missions\/free flight and multiplayer<br>+All of the aircraft feel very responsive<br>+A good mix of fighter aircraft and heavy bombers, not that that's difficult with so few aircraft but more on that later<br>+Simple UI <br>+Very large maps<br>+Great sound effects<br>+The devs are currently working on Summer and Autumn maps which is exciting as the game currently only has Winter maps<br><br>-Only eight aircraft (excluding the two DLC planes) which really isn't good enough for a flight sim<br>-Unlocking anything requires grinding in the campaign mode. Having to grind to unlock skins and weapons in a simulation game is bad enough but the fact that you can only unlock things through the campaign is rather disappointing for those who have no interest in playing the campaign, let alone grind the campaign missions, such as myself<br>-They've already released DLC which I think is unacceptable for an Early Access game and such an expensive one at that (just for the record I own the Deluxe edition which comes with the DLC)<br>-I experienced quite a few issues with freezing and crashing during loading screens<br>-Not many graphics options <br><br>Verdict:<br>7<br><br>A solid WWII flight simulator with gorgeous graphics and great realism that is let down by its lack of planes and all of the grinding to unlock things. If you can look past the lack of aircraft and all of the grinding or you're simply looking for a WWII flight sim then I recommend picking this up.<br><br>***This review was written using a Deluxe Edition key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***<br><br>El K.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15654950', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15654950' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15654950\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15654950' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15654950\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15654950', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15654950_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15654950_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t112 of 160 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11737012\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047141220\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"86875492\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e7ece3d3e57f1edd345075845d2d373023c9ec0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e7ece3d3e57f1edd345075845d2d373023c9ec0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8e\/8e7ece3d3e57f1edd345075845d2d373023c9ec0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047141220\/\" data-miniprofile=\"86875492\">Let's enjoy Animes together<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047141220\/games\/?tab=all\">46 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047141220\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047141220\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">82.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent.<br><br>Even at this stage of early access the sim is highly polished and very impressive. The planes themselves feel very faithfully modelled, both visually (particularly the damage modelling) and in terms of flight characteristics. The narrower selection of planes means that each has been finished to a very high standard, although the developers have already made some suggestions about planes being added following release.<br><br>At the moment there are 10 planes scheduled for release, with only one (the HE-111 medium bomber) not yet added. The Soviets get the much-loved but definitely disadvantaged Lagg, the Yak-1, the Pe-2 and the IL-2. The Luftwaffe have the 109 F4, 109 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s well as the Stuka and the Heinkel. In addition to the 8 basic aircraft there are two additional &quot;premium&quot; aircraft (the FW 190 and the LA 5). These extra two aircraft can be purchased either in the premium version, or by waiting until launch and buying them individually. <br><br>The visual effects are obviously excellent and the sound is generally very good, although a few effects appear to be missing (eg some hit sounds on your own airraft), but that can probably be put down to the game still being in early access.<br><br>The AI is also very impressive and provides a very challenging opponent without resorting to any cheating: the AI follows the same rules as the player, has his vision constrained by the cockpit and controls his plane via control inputs as well. I've occasionally forgotten that I was fighting the computer rather than players online. <br><br>AI gunners also man the gunnery positions in the Heinkel, Pe-2, the Ju-87 and IL-2, however they can also be manned by other human players. Gunnery stations in each of the planes that have them are fully modelled from a first-person pov.<br><br>The multiplayer is also very fun, even at this early stage where it appears to be a basic team deathmatch placeholder. Servers offer two difficulty settings; Normal (icons, automatic engine management, navigation assists) and Expert (no icons, manual engine management and navigation).<br><br>EDIT: From reading the community page, a lot of people seem concerned that the La-5 and FW-190 premium aircraft are some sort of pay-to-win issue. They're intended for enthusiasts as neither played a significant part in the Battle of Stalingrad itself, and neither are the highest performing aircraft on either side: multiplayer is still largely a contest between the Yak-1 and the 109s.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11737012', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11737012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11737012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11737012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11737012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11737012', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11737012_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11737012_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26216901\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"90087628\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c6fb28eac1ca0e12993bbb795cdef6ab7a7ad2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c6fb28eac1ca0e12993bbb795cdef6ab7a7ad2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c6fb28eac1ca0e12993bbb795cdef6ab7a7ad2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/\" data-miniprofile=\"90087628\">November<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/games\/?tab=all\">26 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198050353356\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">177.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't write reviews, I don't like to waste the time, unles... it's deserved.<br><br>People who have complained about this game are generally the type to complain about everything. Sure, the AI is off but can you make a human AI moving in all 4 dimensions while also paying attention to relative physics and analyzing and thinking ahead to their next move? Yes, but not at this level. To make an AI like that is hard; expectations are too high if you think otherwise. Also, this game is mostly about playing online, just like every other game. There are dynamic servers that create fronts that change based on team progress, etc.<br><br>The game, a true sim. Damage model is exceptional, HE rounds explode, AP rounds pierce, fragments fly off the plane and can hit yours if you're too close. Good bullet drop rates, considers grain and powder, doesn't disappear after x distance. Planes handle well, you can feel their weight; you need to consider the weight of ordinance and fuel vs power\/lift. True considerations. Engine management is critical; you must be considerate of RPM, manifold pressure, oil\/water temp, drag from cowls (+\/-30kmph can make a huge difference), prop pitch, supercharger gearing, mixture ratio, fuel amount... <br><br>If you like games where you just feel neurotic running around shooting people, this isn't for you. If you are more an engineer type, where you like to adjust settings, dial in values, problem solve, and then profit, then there is no turning back. There is a huge element of excitement though, and it requires cunning and planning, like chess. Long fights where it  takes 3 minutes of flying while holding onto your kinetic energy to set up a shot, so rewarding. To pepper the wing, and see it destablize and vibrate then rip off is so rewarding. On the recieving end, to have your rudder or elevator peppered, with minimal stick you can make it home; sometimes that alone is the victory.<br><br>This is easily the best game I have ever played. To enjoy it you need to have patience,, foresight, and a maturity that understands that you are not the God of war. You are not the God of flight.

Guns were damaged during the last run.<br>-The bombers turrets put holes in my fuselage, oil explodes from the engine and covers the windscreen<br>-I descend with full flaps, hoping for a soft landing in the crop fields below...<br><br><br>What a great game, if you love flight sims this is a no brainer. I have hours upon hours in FSX over the last 8 years and a little time in Xplane 10, but this is the sim that I have been longing for.<br>I played birds of prey on the 360 years ago, and I loved the combat aspect, but the sim side was really lacking. This version of IL2 is dead on when it comes to flight dynamics. Plus and minus as follows;<br><br>+Extremely realistic flight simulation; wing attack angle is crucial, and the plane shakes and bucks when you push into the critcal zone, leading to a stall if you dont respond quickly.<br>+Realistic ammo loadout; you can and will run out of rounds for all munitions, although I am told you can land and reload. Sometmes, one or two of the cockpit gauges will fail, and the altitude gauge is almost never correct without adjustment<br>+The SOUND - my first mission I had the volume cranked up, listening to the Russian radio chatter and beautiful engine song. The first time I pulled the trigger in combat I litterally jumped. The sound of 20mm guns firing is jarring and pulls you into the world of war. I suggest playing with the volume high, its almost frightening.<br>+Near perfect implementation of TrackIR; I strongly suggest this with any flight sim, its just so good. User Reqium has a great profile that adds alot to the peripheral.<br>+Outstanding visuals and effects; the sun, clouds and ground look great, although I have seen a few bugs in the clouds.<br>+Price; I payed 60 bucks to get in on Prepar3d, which has less aircraft than this game. People \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about the price of the limited edition aircraft, but go have a look at the price of an addon Leerjet for Xplane or Prepar3d. 7$ an aircraft is a great deal considering what they put into the flight models and cockpits of these craft.<br><br>-Loading time; on my top end AMD rig, the missions take about thirty seconds to load. Half of that is before the briefing, half is after I hit start. Also, every mission starts paused, as if they expected a high load time that might make you want to take a pee break. I run the game off an SSD, but my main drive is disc, so maybe that is some of it.<br>-Visuals; I know I said it was a plus earlier, and they are great, but from time to time, some shaders seem to misload, especially clouds, but occasionally in the cockpit. This distracts from an otherwise outstanding simulation.<br>-Control options: The controls lack the option to set an axis to trim any of the three rotational axis, only buttons. I know I can make my X52 output a repeat button press with an axis, but it would be nice to be able to set those in game.<br>-Ground variety; Every strip I have landed at so far looks exactly the same. Sometimes there are two strips, but always dirt and grass. Maybe I am wrong, but there must have been some paved airports with towers and lights somewhere in russia!<br>-Learning curve; This is a difficult game if you want to play air combat. There is no training to speak of, gauges are all foreign unless you know German or Russian, and landing is more difficult than any other sim I have flown. However, this is all very realistic, and that is exactly why I bought the game. It is an unforgiving WW2 combat sim, and I have no doubt that lots of rookies lost their lives trying to land with a missing aileron.<br><br>All said and done, its a fantastic flight sim that pulls you in with lush visuals and bone shaking sound effects. I cant imagine playing without a flight stick atleast, but the option is there to fly with a mouse if you so choose. Any fellow simmers out there who are debating this puchase, just do it and get drawn in, and you will forget the price real quick.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30303687', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30303687' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30303687\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30303687' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30303687\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30303687', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30303687_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30303687_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30300805\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979530057\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"19264329\">Pilot37<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 34.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReally Excellent Sim <br><br>(Just frustrated by the fact that I spend half my time trying to reset controls on my Saitek X52 Pro.

The descriptions in the settings are vague to the uninitiated and trial and error takes hours only to find they reset themselves)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30300805', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30300805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30300805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30300805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30300805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30300805', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30300805_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30300805_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30255767\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/IckieStickieMick\/recommended\/307960\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"37901677\">Ickie\u2654Stickie\u2122<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThought id unplug the Warthog_Throttle and Try again with Xbox360 usb controller,Great decision!I can Fly!...I can Fly I can Fly...Who put that tree there!?...Shame later maybe once ive grasped this and appreciated this game really for what it is(now that i can)i may return  and use the Warthog.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30255767', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30255767' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30255767\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30255767' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30255767\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30255767', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30255767_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30255767_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/307960\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 948 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30442054","30636384","30629360","30490040","19900476","13520223","11733708","15654950","11737012","26216901"]}
