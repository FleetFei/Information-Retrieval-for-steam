Their backgrounds are pre-defined, and both have access to the same skills.  Who you pick determines mostly how certain NPCs react to you (some may mistrust elves, for example) and what your romantic options are.<br><br>* Yes, there are romantic options in all flavors.  Up until the very last screen of the romance, there's nothing risque - just a bunch of meaningul campfire scenes between you and your beloved (kind of like Dragon Age Origins).  The last screen of the romances tends to be a little racy, but it's easy enough to click through it in a microsecond if you wish.  Each completed romance also gets a rather sweet scene or two in the epilogue.<br><br>* Combat is turn-based, and reminds me of the old-style Wizardry games.  The screenshots give you a pretty good idea of what it looks like.  There's a priority system to attacks, with fast characters going first, slower ones second, etc.  Each attack or spell lengthens your wait timer by a different amount.  The end result is surprisingly intuitive.  <br><br>* There are a ton of excellent skills to play with.  Each character gets two skill trees.  The first one is fighter, mage or rogue, and shared with other characters of that class.  In my playthrough, I seldom put points there.  Instead, I focused on the far more interesting second skill tree, which is peculiar to each character.  There you find things like Assassination, Dark Magic, Nature Magic, Berserker, Martial Arts, etc.  There's enough variety and 'oh, neat!' factors to keep you experimenting with them for hours.<br><br>* Though simple-looking, combat is strategic. You need to juggle placement (fighters up front, ranged in the back, etc.), status effects, buffs, debuffs, attacks with various AoE shapes (all enemies, just a column, just a row), and a Pokemon-like strength and weakness system ('You cast rainstorm at Fire Demon - it's super effective!').<br><br>* Let's talk loot. There's a lot of it here.  You can find it by defeating enemies, solving quests or buying it at a shop.  Shop prices drop as your reputation in each region rises, so it pays to complete non-plot-related tasks in the towns that produce your favorite plate armor, etc.  Each of your followers has a loyalty quest, just like in Mass Effect or Dragon Age.  If you finish it, not only will you have learned more about your companion, but you'll have a powerful piece of equipment they alone can wear.<br><br>* Speaking of Dragon Age, the story here is similar in outline to that of Origins: an ancient evil has resurfaced, but the factions that could take it down are too busy bickering with each other, and it's up to your band  of adventurers to earn the respect and confidence of each region in order to unite them for a common offensive.  It's a solid framework that kept me entertained for the 10+ hours I played - not once did I feel like skipping through a text box or chat bubble.<br><br>* Which reminds me.... the characters are not entirely silent.  You'll hear their battle cries and comments in combat.  It's a nice touch, but be aware that most of the rest of the game is text-based.<br><br>The first time I clicked 'play' it was early evening, and I 'just wanted to try it out'.  I figured I'd do the tutorial, see if there were any glaring errors or red flags, then shut it off and go do something else.  Didn't happen.<br><br>Instead, I found myself glued to the screen until 6:30 AM.  This is a really, really good game, folks, and if you're into old-school Wizardry-style RPGS with memorable characters, you should definitely give this one a try.<br><br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8720428', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8720428' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8720428\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8720428' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8720428\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8720428', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8720428_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8720428_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t129 of 145 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12456071\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105713910\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105713910\">verstehen<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/games\/?tab=all\">328 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 11, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLoren has the distinction of being the first game ever where I picked the male PC to use over a female PC for a first playthrough. As a woman gamer, this is really rare! But Loren presents two interesting backstories to choose from and those backstories really do influence how others treat your character and the dialogue options you have. <br><br>So, to back up: this is basically a low-fi version of Dragon Age. It's heavily story driven, with several interesting characters, tons of dialogue and interaction, huge amounts of world-building, lots of really cool and diverse types of female characters, realistic conflict between characters, and Loren manages to do it all without BioWare's budget or AAA status. The character designs are really cool (Dora and Chambara are probably my favorites) and once I realized (about 5 hours into the game, whoops!) there was a &quot;fast combat&quot; option in the menu to speed things up, the classic turn-based combat made me fairly nostalic. My big complaint with the game would probably be the skill trees, partially because for strength-based (warriors) characters most of the skills were useless and for will (mages) and skill-based (thieves) the skills were often unbalanced and there's never a marker to tell you when\/how you can gain certain skills (is it progression? A certain level of will? What? Why can I NEVER pick that skill?). It gets frustrating, particularly at higher levels, as the skill points you receive are minimal throughout the game. <br><br>Regardless of my frustration with the skill trees (and by about hour 7 I just gave up and started auto-assigning), Loren's definitely one of the better RPGs I've played recently. I'm looking forward to the other playthroughs I intend to do to see alternate paths, romances, and endings.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12456071', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12456071' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12456071\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12456071' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12456071\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12456071', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12456071_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12456071_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9976956\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"107147622\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/22\/227f648cf27c6c0183a371bf9dc1dcc3f3d895ef.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/22\/227f648cf27c6c0183a371bf9dc1dcc3f3d895ef.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/22\/227f648cf27c6c0183a371bf9dc1dcc3f3d895ef_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/\" data-miniprofile=\"107147622\">toad_004<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/games\/?tab=all\">214 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/toad004\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 29, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI hate overly positive reviews. The entire review scale on most websites has been shifted because these incarnations of Pollyanna insist on giving everything 10s. Just the thought that 3\/5 or 5\/10 isn't considered &quot;average&quot; makes me want to extract vengeance on the endless parade of perfect scores. Now that I have adequately set myself up as hypocrite of the year, let's begin the review.<br><br>This game is about Loren, who happens to be the princess of the Amazons (yes, I am Captain Obvious, and I'm going for promotion - I like the sound of &quot;Major Obvious&quot;). Going against all gaming tropes, she doesn't get kidnapped, nor do you play as her. Loren: The Amazon Princess begins with the titular character decapitating some training dummies, then berating her slaves for failing to provide more. She is then quickly informed that her mother (the Queen) did not return and is presumed dead. Loren rejects this and embarks on a mission to save her mother, but the captain manages to force Loren to take the Amazon's most prized slave - that's you.<br><br>This game's greatest strength is its characters. Sure, Loren may be a terrifying-dual-sword-wielding-badass, but she's also never left the citadel before, and it shows. Within an hour of starting the game, she will have demanded to speak to the Queen of a republic, choked a bartender for the crime of ignoring her, and referred to the Amazons as better than all other nations. Other characters are no less entertaining, as you meet characters like Draco Firestarter - a fire mage who likes to start fires (am I a major yet?) and manages to cause the rest of the party to burst out laughing every time he talks, or Dora the <span class=\"bb_strike\">explorer<\/span> nicest thief in town - she teaches that the best way to make friends is to give them money.<br><br>This does lead me to one of this game's few flaws - while the dialogue is well written all around, you have little insight into what your character will say. Every dialogue choice you make is one of four options - Joking, Friendly, or Forceful - and occasionally Romance. While the latter always progresses that character's romance, the first three aren't very clear on what you're about to say. For example, early in the game you arrive in a nearby city and Loren insults it. Your response? Joking, Friendly, or Forceful, without any indication on whether an option agrees with Loren or not. The only surefire way is to save before you choose, then pick every option and see which you'd prefer.<br><br>The graphics are a matter of taste - this game isn't meant to melt your GPU to your motherboard. Many of the reviews seem to hate the graphics, I personally enjoy the graphics. The only graphical issue is with a few of the backgrounds - I noticed stairs leading up to a castle tower looked exactly the same as stairs to an inn's rooms. Minor, but a little strange. Overall though, I'd suggest looking at screenshots and seeing for yourself if you like the graphics. I really don't suggest deciding to purchase (or not) a game based on graphics. <br><br>The gameplay is fairly straightforward if you've played RPGs before - everyone is either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, and you've got Strength, Skill, and Will to put points in. Certain enemies might be weak against or resistant to certain elements (you used typhoon on fire demon! It's Super Effective!). However, there are a few gameplay elements that aren't self-explanatory, and they aren't explained to you either. For example - dual-wielding carries a penalty (except on Loren, who has a skill to remove this penalty). However, if you wield a dagger in the offhand, you aren't penalized - the game never actually tells you this. It also doesn't bother clarifying stats such as &quot;Attack&quot; , &quot;Damage&quot; (aren't they the same thing?) and &quot;threshold&quot; (I still have no clue that this does).<br><br>The vast majority of modern games have a few places at which you can choose a different path - and it almost always comes across as a failed attempt to get the player to play the game again. This is one of the few games where it actually works - once I finished the game, I was ready to start over with another character right then and there. Very few games have such replay value, but many of the choices you make actually give you a different story for a while.<br><br>This is one of those rare titles that actually appeals to gamers that care about characters and story, rather than running 4096x2160 at 120fps, or shooting everything you see with generic guns and getting racial slurs in return. If this type of game doesn't appeal to you, then go download <i>Duty of Calling: Fieldbattle 12<\/i>. But if you care the slightest about deep characters or a game that can pull you into its world, then I can't recommend this more.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9976956', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9976956' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9976956\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9976956' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9976956\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9976956', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9976956_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9976956_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18518032\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stolensweetroll\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"76663613\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e0abfc85310aeaf849a8545a133d4d7a590e4c14.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e0abfc85310aeaf849a8545a133d4d7a590e4c14.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e0abfc85310aeaf849a8545a133d4d7a590e4c14_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stolensweetroll\/\" data-miniprofile=\"76663613\">(-TN-) Sakaki<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stolensweetroll\/games\/?tab=all\">16 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stolensweetroll\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stolensweetroll\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI recommend this game under the condition that it's in a HumbleBundle or more than 75% off. $20 is too much for what you get, but if you pay less than $5 then it's well worth your money. Keep in mind that that this is pretty much a visual novel with some RPG elements\/combat tossed in. <br><br>Pros:<br>- Fun, casual gameplay <br>- Catchy soundtrack<br>- Artwork isn't bad<br>- Male\/Female playable characters<br>- Many romance options<br>- Random encounters are skippable (as opposed to having to &quot;flee&quot;)<br>- Combat system is interesting and relatively intuitive<br>- Many different classes and characters to fight with, all with a broad range of usable weapons and armor<br>- Cheat mode to skip combat after beating the game once, to view different endings more quickly<br><br>Neutral:<br>- There is A LOT of dialogue, and there are plenty of times where somebody repeats what they already said to you to another character<br>- Elemental weapons are an option, <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>but they aren't entirely useful due to enemy resistances; you're better off using normal type weapons for consistent damage and leaving the elemental attacks to the mages' spells<\/span><\/span><br>- Some unique boss drops can be purchased in shops, for some reason<br><br>Cons:<br>- As previousy discussed, the price tag<br>- Story isn't anything new or special<br>- Cliche\/annoying character personalities<br>- Can only romance one character per playthrough<br>- Only one or two background images for each location, plus a few common ones that get recycled (tomb, forest, etc)<br>- A few continuity problems with the dialogue depending on your previous choices\/the order in which you choose to do things (<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>like when Dora exclaims her fear of Death Knights and how she has never seen one\/hopes to never see one, despite having already battled one<\/span><\/span>)<br>- Combat mechanics don't seem to work consistently; sometimes using Taunt III will increase your aggro by 30%, other times by 4% (and the enemies will attack somebody else anyway)<br>- There are fights that require certain characters to be used, which can be annoying if you don't usually use that character and they are underleveled\/poorly equipped as a result<br>- There is a severe lack of cloth\/padded pants and belts in the shops; Dora and Draco were bottomless for the entirety of my playthrough<br><br>Overall, it's an enjoyable little game to waste some time on, but wait for a sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18518032', 'summary' );

This is most likely due to the fact that this is a lot more RPG than VN, but some of those are good as well.<br><br>The combat is enjoyable and has a fair amount of depth for what is available, with a wide assortment of enemies with differing strengths\/weaknesses. There is a wide variety of characters (+3 more in the DLC) who are all completely different. I loved pretty much every conversation with them. The characters all look fantastic, as do the various backgrounds. <br><br>There is a LOT of text to read in this game, but if you're used to RPGs\/VNs, this should be no problem. Depending on the difficulty chosen, the game can offer a decent challenge, requiring careful consideration of abilities, items and attributes.<br><br>Despite how much I loved it, I'm hesitant to recommend it at the full purchase price of $20 ($25 for Deluxe with DLC). Several of my hours spent were in 3rd\/4th playthroughs for achievements. Whenever there's a discount, go ahead and pick it up; you won't regret it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15459901', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15459901' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15459901\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15459901' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15459901\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15459901', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15459901_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15459901_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary8862962\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"123937881\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/\" data-miniprofile=\"123937881\">GameDragonZero<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/games\/?tab=all\">89 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/recommended\/\">54 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 26, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI got curious about this game when I saw the idea of fusing RPGs and visual novels.  Though I've seen the mechanic a few times, &quot;Loren&quot; seemed to focus on doing &quot;more&quot; with both of its parents.<br><br>I can't call the game an insta-buy at $19.99 -  it's going to depend on wether it's for you.  Me, a person who likes his RPGs with loot, skills, story, and choices (and now and then likes a game that you can sit down with for 30 minutes or 2 hours), thinks he got his money's worth.  It is definitely a replayable game as well, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try different endings and plots, then that's a plus.  I found a full playthrough is about 10 hours (winning unlocks  cheat mode)<br><br>&quot;Loren&quot; is the story of an amazon princess who's mother vanishes, presumed dead, and promptly gives up her queenship to find her.  She's given a single slave to help her - that's you by the way - and very quickly you're necessary as Loren is essentially a niave, unsubtle, combat machine.  Very quickly Loren and your chosen hero\/heroine (who you do get some customization of) end up caught up in wars and intrigue, and collect a ragtag bunch of somewhat familiar characters.  So it's off to battle orcs, lizardmen, demons, and more because the world's problems are a LOT bigger than a missing queen  . . . <br><br>The game mixes visual novel style branching storylines and classic &quot;Camp&quot; dialogue with point-and-click maps and classic RPG combat.  It actually balances all of these pretty well - most events are &quot;bite sized&quot;, combats don't drag on for long, and there's a pleasing level of detail in things like equipment, character development, and battle strategy.  If you're an accomplished RPG player you probably won't find &quot;Normal&quot; too hard, though there are moments that will push you - you do have to pay attention.<br><br>The best part of the combat and character building are how different factors interact - Status effects are a big part of the game, and soon you'll be trying to figure the best way to put your foes off guard.  Classes are meant to work together, especially in boss battles - and every character is &quot;dual classes&quot; with a generic class and a specialty class, adding a nice bit of customazation to the usual trinity of Warrior-Mage-Theif.  In short you're always &quot;this basic class and . . .&quot;<br><br>The story is the big selling point, and frankly, &quot;Loren&quot; delivers a giant heaping helping of common fantasy elements and characters that we're all familiar with (perhaps too much), but then actually goes the distance to add little personal details that bring the characters and events to life.  Sure the prose has a purple tinge, and some elements border on stereotype, but it's fun and you'll find a few surprises - you actually get a nice amount of character backstory if you dive into it, as well as interesting romantic complications.  There are parts that will definitely pull at your heartstrings, and I found myself geniunely liking some of the cast.<br><br>So a buy?  I'd say if you like your RPGs with story, want a good RPG you can play in short bursts or long sessions, and if something a bit experimental like this appeals, go for it.  I think this is also a game to encourage, because the fusion is quite satisfying - and I'd like to see more.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8862962', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8862962' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8862962\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8862962' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8862962\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8862962', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8862962_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8862962_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12607301\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JaysonFour\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"179728164\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a71e833e0dabc6eef321c003d4fbb9bf4dedd8d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a71e833e0dabc6eef321c003d4fbb9bf4dedd8d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2a\/2a71e833e0dabc6eef321c003d4fbb9bf4dedd8d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JaysonFour\/\" data-miniprofile=\"179728164\">JaysonFour<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JaysonFour\/games\/?tab=all\">397 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JaysonFour\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JaysonFour\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 24, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLet me just say that Winter Wolves is a company who ought to get much more in the way of support- because this game is essentially one of the greatest visual novel games I've ever been able to play.<br><br>Loren the Amazon Princess is a game that is actually worth the full price- a rarity in these times, but if you like fantasy or adventure games, you'll want to grab this.  For once, you don't even play as the title character- instead, you play the second banana- either a human male slave, or an elven female.  The character you choose may have different observations about certain scenarios, and they may have a different set of people they might start a relationship with, but to be quite obvious, that's all the difference between them.  Both the male or female characters can get the same moves and the same classes, so really the only thing you're getting is a different view of the world.<br><br>Combat is actually very well-handled- you just place your characters, and go.  Their turn comes up, you pick a skill or an item to use, and then you repeat until the combat is done.  You'll always have a healer on hand, because whatever you pick for your character- gender or class- you get a class of Healer right off the bat.  <br><br>As far as the story, it's actually well-written, and the characters have their own personalities.   You can talk to them in camp, you can flirt with a certain few of them, and if your scores are high enough, you'll even end up having to make a choice in a lovers' triangle between two party members- or maybe even more. There are both gay and straight options for both male and female characters- even more than Dragon Age, for crying out loud, and that's saying something.  <br><br>There's even a bit of DLC, which unlocks four more party members and expands the third chapter with an entire new area.  It is completely worth it, no matter what.  <br><br>Finally, a bit of warning:  Yes, the Steam version is the toned-down version.  There's a wokaround that you can use, but fair warning- this does create some NSFW scenes in the story, and changes some of the outfits on characters.  Take it as you will.<br><br>All in all, I would play this again and again and again, unlike some full-price console games and the like.

This may not be worth the full $20 price it's starting at--but, it's certainly an enjoyable game w\/ much going for it.  Even the soundtrack is worth keeping on during play.  <br><br>Overall, the dialog is both detailed and brief enough to keep the story interesting and enjoyable.  The choices in action and dialogue do have somewhat of an impact in the progress of the story.  But, having played a bit more at this point, I'd have to say most of it is just 'when' you see events, rather than true story impacts.  The 'camp' dialogues are limited in player options for responses (Joking, Friendly, Forceful, and the occasional [Romantic]) w\/ fairly obvious outcomes from each.  It gives the feel of relationship development, but at a graphic novel level rather than actually giving a role playing experience.<br><br>The fact that you play a supporting role instead of the lead is a refreshing twist on the entire experience.  This may even be worth a replay to see what different choices may accomplish.  But, the story follows a fairly straightforward direction.  It is a standard high fantasy tale worth your attention if you're looking for a lunchtime break that includes some playable strategic combat, predictable but enjoyable 'relationship' elements, and dialogue that is decent and not excessive.<br><br>For the record, please don't rate this down just b\/c you think the game's not epic.  I'm not saying it's a Bioware title.  I'm saying, it's a decent $10\/$15 game that is worth spending some lunch hours on.<br><br>Hope this helps!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8722214', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8722214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8722214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8722214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8722214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8722214', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8722214_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8722214_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12975847\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"106924073\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8a\/8ab2d66fe15922395df93d6497bd2e65b06d253a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/\" data-miniprofile=\"106924073\">Ceaseless Duality<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/games\/?tab=all\">214 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/recommended\/\">66 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duszynski\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">111.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 16, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game quickly became one of my Top 5 Favorite Games on Steam. It's a JRPG-style game from an non-Japanese indie game company named Winter Wolves. This company is mostly known for dating sims and visual novels, but honestly, I think this game is their best yet. (Although, to be fair, I haven't played all their games yet.) <br><br>Important note: The DLC is a MUST HAVE. Honestly, the story would seem very incomplete without it, so if you get this game, get the DLC. This review is also based on having it.<br><br>While this is definitely a RPG, the fact that a lot of their games are visual novels definitely shows in the design. There is zero action in the turn-based battles. In fact, they rely solely on pictures to represent what takes place in the battle. For a lot of people, this is a flaw, but for me, I was indifferent to this type of gameplay. What was important was that the game was fun to play. <br><br>It took me roughly 20 or so hours to get through the game the first time. This is considered short for a RPG, but it has potential for several playthroughs. Personally, I went through 13 playthroughs, going for all the achievements. It can get a bit repetitive going through the game that many times, but thankfully, the creators realized this; there is a cheat mode that enables &quot;story mode&quot; in which the player automatically wins every battle, which can get you through the game much quicker. Obviously, the game is story-driven, which is a big highlight to me. The story is definitely influenced by Lord of the Rings. I can't blame for that, LotR is awesome. However, there are a couple of races that do not exist in the LotR world that exist in this game. Another 1-up this game has is that there's an even distribution of gender between the characters, unlike the sausagefest that is LotR. <br><br>There is a bit of a dating sim element to this game, but you can actually get through the game without romancing anyone (in fact, there's an achievement for that). There are several people the main character can romance, which is what gives the game the potential for several playthroughs. Each one has its own unique effect on the story. <br>Kudos to the creators for allowing same-sex coupling, which is a reoccurring thing in the Winter Wolves games. <br><br>Sort of spoiler-ish, but not really:<br>There are also a few different ways to end the game. Ultimately, the Death Knight (main villain) is defeated in each ending, but how you defeat him depends on things you do in the game. I looked up which way is canon out of curiosity, but ultimately, it's up to the player to decide how the Death Knight should meet his &quot;fate.&quot; There's also a pretty heavy hint at the end of the game that there will be a sequel. <br><br>Flaws:<br>- There are absolutely no people of color in this game. White people EVERYWHERE; there isn't even a NPC that has a shade or two. And no, blue-skinned dark elves do not count. I mean realistic people of color. <br>- The game could do without so much sexualization of the characters, particularly the women. It isn't really necessary that they be half-naked, especially when they're supposed to be fighting in a war. <br>- I found one technical error in the game. In each town\/village, there's a shop and a fame score. The player can earn fame by doing tasks for that particular town\/village. Well, sometimes, if you go to a shop in a town\/village that has no fame score yet, it'll re-direct to a previous shop. For example, while I was playing, I went to the elves' village's shop and it was linking me to the Citadel's shop. However, once I earned some fame in the elves' village, it correctly went to their shop. This error can actually benefit the player, so it isn't a huge deal.<br><br>Despite its flaws, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, especially if they enjoy story-driven games and visual novels \/ dating sims.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12975847', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12975847' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12975847\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12975847' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12975847\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12975847', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12975847_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12975847_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15663528\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kindofgaming\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"117451230\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/25d9d580ebe52073109f2fe2ce8fc3419b7fe733.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/25d9d580ebe52073109f2fe2ce8fc3419b7fe733.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/25d9d580ebe52073109f2fe2ce8fc3419b7fe733_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kindofgaming\/\" data-miniprofile=\"117451230\">kindofgaming<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kindofgaming\/games\/?tab=all\">784 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kindofgaming\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kindofgaming\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">105.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 2, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI LOVED this game. As someone who is not particularly well-versed at RPG's, I was pleased that the battle system was easy to learn and navigate, and the battles themselves were well placed throughout the storyline. With a mix of RPG, visual novel and dating sim aspects, I was never bored and while the story might seem pretty cliche, I think the characters and their individual stories were what really made this game enjoyable for me. Once I started playing, I found it hard to quit.<br><br>The art style was simple and while some may complain that some of the backgrounds were overused, I found that to be part of the simple charm. Chances are, if you're concentrating more on the backgrounds than the story, this game probably isn't for you.<br><br>As an added bonus, the story had great continuity and the characters each had their own personality and quirks.

I was actually moved by the nostalgia of the whole thing and I think I actually bought this game off-sale for that very reason... - That being said, I didn't really regret it - not very much, anyway...<br>The story is stereotypical, but I expected nothing less. And it's actually fairly well written, all things considered. Sure the art could be &quot;shinier&quot; and more detailed Sure the writing could be better, rosier or even more Novel-like. Sure the combat system could be more elaborate or in-depth and strategic. But- The question is, to all of the above, what the f for? Why put more spice on a cooked, seasoned meal?<br>I played through it a few times, experimenting with the difficulty, (and no, I didn't do all the endings yet, I'm saving it for a cold winter's day or something...) and, while a little long-winded and verbose, the story just plain works. It takes a good long while to build up, and it's a little challenging to wrap your head around how or why our &quot;Heroes&quot; get to have any part in saving the world, as anything other than a sidequest, but who cares... - You just roll with it, and have fun with it.<br>The story is interesting. It'll probably be even more interesting if you have or take the time to read it all.<br>The Graphics are good enough. The art is actually pretty good. It could have been better, we know, but it could've been OH so much worse...<br>The controls are... - well, if you're patient enough to learn how to use a turn based fighting system, it's difficult to mess up. It just takes time. It's not the most sophisticated system, but it doesn't have to be. It works.<br>The Funfactor is very, very, very, theme, concept and VN-based. The game is more RPG than VN, though you won't confuse it for any other RPG or JRPG.<br>Replayabillity: Given the simple fact that you can play again, with or without extra content, progressing in different ways, with different origins and even a different character (of a different sex,) there's obviously a good platform for replayabillity. - And if the Devs are of a mind, they might even add more on top of that...<br>As an RPG, LTAP is less than Average, but also more because of The Visual Novel element, which adds loads of ambience, locations, characters, plotlines, fights and outcomes than you'd care to do the probabillity math on.<br>It's not a game for everyone, but I urge those who like a good read, or a good bout of relaxed RPG, or perhaps even those who like both. (I happen to be one of those, so I have to assume others exist.)<br>This game takes time, (unless you just click away, in which case I can't fathom why you've bothered buying a VN tagged game in the first place,) so if you're going to get into it, make the time for it. - I'm not saying it'll be worth it, that's up to the individual, but if you rush, you won't have the chance to find out.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30022199', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30022199' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30022199\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30022199' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30022199\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30022199', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30022199_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30022199_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29638610\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Skyvolker3\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"70139865\">Skywalker<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is first time I play visual novel game and there is a pluses and minuses for me.

Yes, the story is cliche, and yeah the turn-based combat was shallow, but I truly enjoyed my time with Loren the Amazon Princess. The story, artwork, and music are all simple, but done well. This game is the definition of a simple but very solid RPG\/Visual novel.

It is a nice mixture of VN and RPG tactical combat with a really great story which keeps you coming back for more. I needed 20h to finish the game without DLC, and I was positivly surprised that the combat mechanics is quite complex, the fight are just right (actually quite hard) on normal difficulty. However, the most important aspect is the beautiful characters and their romances. The music is another highlight for me... honestly, it is impossible to not fall in love with Myrth when the Elven music (I call it love theme) plays... and when she smiles at you you forget the world around you... :) <br>My only gripe with this game is that even romancing all with my chosen male character (there is a female to pick too for another playhtrough), and getting all the ending achievements, I only had 30% of achievements... too many come only from the DLC, which is much less discounted than if you would buy the whole game PLUS DLC, so no DLC for me, sorry.<br>Nevertheless, I cried several times during the story, and fell in love with some of the drawn characters and the music!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28935433', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28935433' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28935433\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28935433' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28935433\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28935433', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28935433_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28935433_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28916915\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Aurinium\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"39293587\">Aurinium<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 25.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSurprisingly addicting visual novel!  The characters are very charming and the story is pretty entertaining.  The turn-based RPG mechanics aren't anything extraordinary, but still fun regardless of the simplicity!  This is probably one of my most favorite visual novels I've played so far if not my current top favorite.  The DLC is worth getting, too, for the extra characters\/romance options and story additions.  I'd be very interested in playing more games made by this developer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28916915', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28916915' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28916915\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28916915' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28916915\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28916915', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28916915_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28916915_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28779799\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/camelotcrusade\/recommended\/257970\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"68088341\">camelotcrusade<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 27.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is great!  I haven't played many visual novels, but after the strong recommendation of a friend I gave Loren a try.   It's been more fun than I expected, I've gifted it to a couple friends hoping they enjoy it, too.<br><br>The blending of RPG and visual novel is really well done, and the pacing is such that you can decide how much you want to do and when.  In fact, this is one of the things I like about it the most--once you get rolling, you can take it in bite-sized pieces, or sit down for a marathon, it's up to you.  The ability to save anywhere, plus lots of places to explore, shop, or grind means you have plenty to enjoy (and stop and start up again instantly).  <br><br>The characters are interesting and varied, and there are enough fights that you can try all sorts of combos and give everyone a chance to be used.  I would have liked a way to reset skill points after I figured out what works and what doesn't work nearly as well, but that's what additional playthroughs are for, I guess (and if I missed a way to reset them, let me know).  <br><br>The writing is strong, the story interesting enough to keep you going, and the romances fun to pursue while everything else is going on.  You can also unlock an uncensored version painlessly (see the forums for more) if you prefer a little hot sauce (and I do mean a little, imo it's just for fun and not so over-the-top that it's distracting).   And about the romances, I liked all the ones I pursued.  While you can't do every combination, there are enough choices for all tastes to keep it interesting.<br><br>What else can I say?  Well, I'll repeat that the combat is surprisingly enjoyable.  It's a simple system, but it's a rewarding one, and if you put in enough time you can become so strong you don't even have to know what you're doing (heheh).   Gearing up, powering up, and trying out all sorts of party members was a joy.  Finally, the ending was superb.  I really felt it was worth all my investment into the game and it was both satisfying and moving.<br><br>Good job, Winter Wolves!  Looking forward to Loren 2.  :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28779799', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28779799' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28779799\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28779799' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28779799\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28779799', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28779799_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28779799_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/257970\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 413 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["8720428","12456071","9976956","18518032","15459901","8862962","12607301","8722214","12975847","15663528"]}
