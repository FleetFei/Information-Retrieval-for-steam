The gameplay is like a mix between a MegaMan style action platforming with Gradius-like upgrades to make you more powerful. These features work well together, and provide a very nice gameplay experience. It has great music, cute characters, fun gameplay, and has a rewarding level of challenge, especially for the bosses. The HD upgrades for the Steam release are awesome; the game looks great! You can also save ghost data of your playthrough, which is very useful for speedrunning. The developer is very passionate about this game and loves talking with fans and players in order to provide a good experience, although english is not his first language. It has already included patches based on feedback from fans (including Xbox 360 controller support). <br><br>I have put a ton of playtime into this game, and it is a great value for its price. I highly recommend checking it out if you are a fan of action platformers!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19430359', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19430359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19430359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19430359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19430359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19430359', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19430359_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19430359_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/420770\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20396361\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"107625602\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2cbe0e22570c1415cef5233cc2bcafa1b0676320_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/\" data-miniprofile=\"107625602\">Samurai Vader<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/games\/?tab=all\">5,052 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/\">100 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SamuraiVader\/recommended\/420770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Summary:<\/div>The Legend of Dark Witch is a challenging platformer made by Japanese studio INSIDE SYSTEM. Originally on Nintendo 3DS, a year later it got ported also on Steam, with keyboard and gamepad support.<br><br>The game offers several levels, each with a boss who gives you a new skill after you beat them. You can select one from three difficulties, which I'd call easy, hard and hardcore. Anyway, if you are not sure how good you are, you can try the hardest difficulty and change it to lower later with tears in your eyes.<br><br>Visuals just fits the average pixelart anime style you might've seen in many other games from the genre. You'll find many significant and original enemies through your gameplay, for example (my favourite) is the snow giant with Santa's hat who breathes fire.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros:<\/div>- Fine platformer with focus on higher difficulty, though the lowest one should be viable even for casual players and platformer newbies.<br>- <b>Anime pixelart style<\/b>. There's nothing bad on it, especially in a indie game for 5 euros.<br>- <b>Hardcore achievements -&gt; Replayability<\/b>. The easiest one is to actually beat the game (4% of total owners got it), all the others are motivators to replay the game on higher difficulty or under other special circumstances (e.g. without any upgrade).<br>- RPG system with permanent upgrades for your character.<br>- Gamepad support. Though not full, you'll have to use mouse, at least for the first configuration.<br>- You can select jumping sensitivity in the options.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons:<\/div>- <b>Difficult blocking<\/b>. Blocking is made the harder way in the game, as you have to quickly tap left or right button in the right time to block. Personally, I don't like that way of blocking (well, I'm not a good platformer player, that might be the reason).<br>- The game may crash if you try to Alt+Tab on fullscreen mode.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20396361', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20396361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20396361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20396361' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20396361\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20396361', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20396361_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20396361_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19432063\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Larxinostic\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"244471863\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/504b084f2654e06bb6aa12a0efee4623a1cdea3d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/504b084f2654e06bb6aa12a0efee4623a1cdea3d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/504b084f2654e06bb6aa12a0efee4623a1cdea3d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Larxinostic\/\" data-miniprofile=\"244471863\">Larxinostic<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Larxinostic\/games\/?tab=all\">40 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Larxinostic\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Larxinostic\/recommended\/420770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 1, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>Recommended:<\/i> Game: <b>Yes<\/b> | Port: <b>Yes<\/b><br><i>Overall:<\/i> Game: <b>6<\/b>\/10 | Port: <b>8<\/b>\/10<br><i>Breakdown:<\/i> Gameplay: <b>6<\/b>\/10 | Story: <b>5<\/b>\/10 | Sound: <b>7<\/b>\/10 | Graphics: <b>7<\/b>\/10<br><br><i>The Legend of Dark Witch<\/i> is a cute Japanese indie 2D platformer fusing <i>Mega Man<\/i>-style game flow and level design with <i>Gradius<\/i>-style powerups. Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, <i>Dark Witch<\/i> has now pleasantly made its way to Steam. Its port did need some tuning at first, particularly in terms of controller input and layout recognition. Now that those issues have been resolved, the game unveils itself to be satisfying and affordable enough that I can safely recommend it as a decent, enjoyable little platformer.<br><br>Zizou Olympia, the titular Dark Witch, has set out on a trek to locate and retrieve the stolen Syega crystals, which supply magical blessings to the general populace. As a goddess, and a bit of a snarky one at that, Zizou's not going to let anyone obstruct her investigation - and hence, she finds herself progressing through eight stages, each overseen by a potential culprit. The game plays out like an early-era <i>Mega Man<\/i> series entry across mostly-horizontal stages, rear-guarded by a boss who'll yield her special weapon to Zizou upon defeat. Throughout the stages, however, Zizou collects Tres power from slain foes, building up an enforcement gauge offering various <i>Gradius<\/i>-style powerups such as increases in running speed and shot power. The game's above-average difficulty encourages the player to put these to good use rather than sit back hoarding Tres, especially since each attack Zizou survives depletes some of her accumulated Tres gauge. Fortunately, merely attacking a boss can also build some meter so that Zizou won't face the prospect of going totally without Tres at a critical moment. All acquired Tres can then be spent at the menu shop between stages to improve Zizou's base parameters and the potential utility of her newfound special attacks. Each of the opening 6 bosses can be tackled in any order, after which the penultimate and final bosses - including the Syega's thief - await. It's up to the player to learn which boss is weak to which special power inherited from defeated bosses.<br><br>The game's colorful stages definitely stand out more in HD than they did on the small 3DS screen. A few nifty stage effects reminiscent of 16-bit-era <i>Sonic<\/i> and <i>Rocket Knight<\/i> games add to the flavor of the stages and gameplay. While none of the pixel art demonstrates sheer excellence, it's altogether capable and generally good-looking. Even better, the lineart assets really spring into focus in this HD polishing. Characters look sharp, eye-catching, and pleasingly adorable. Moreover, the game's decently-catchy soundtrack sounds easily clearer and beefier here than it ever could've on 3DS. Again, 16-bit-era gaming comes to mind, both in composition and presentation of the music. Few tunes really stand out as exceptional, yet similarly, few tunes prove to be headache-inducing or flat-out unlikable. There're some good songs here, listenable outside the game (without being knockout classics). On the flip side of the audio, competent Japanese voicework complements the admittedly-plain story snippets. It's not that <i>Dark Witch<\/i> lacks charming ladies; it's that those charming ladies don't say or do much at all. One might draw parallels here with, for example, a danmaku\/bullet-hell shoot-'em-up in the vein of <i>eXceed 3rd:<\/i> a cast of nicely-drawn gals who don't leave too much of an impression either way. Basically, the story frames the gameplay but doesn't extend beyond it. As with the older <i>Mega Mans<\/i> - or <i>Mega Men,<\/i> perchance? - this is fine. Not great, but fine.<br><br>As for PC conversion and compatibility, <i>Dark Witch<\/i> v1.01 now natively supports 360-mode controllers. The game does play well enough on keyboard since it doesn't need a huge array of buttons to press at once, but it was wise for Inside System to better configure the initial limited controller support so as to ensure compatibility with a decent range of controllers. I'm playing it on a Logitech F310, a controller with which I've no qualms with how <i>Dark Witch<\/i> recognizes it. This is a positive alteration to aid with navigating the above-average difficulty of the game, at least in regards to the Normal setting. Here's some gratitude extended to Inside System for remedying these pitfalls, as they had dampened the fun of the game for several people.<br><br>Overall, <i>The Legend of Dark Witch<\/i> doesn't really approach the level of a spectacular game. Rather, it's a generally *good* game throughout: good, colorful graphics; good, catchy music; good, solid gameplay. It isn't much for excelling, but it's not really horrid in any way. The story's not much, and Normal mode's no pushover. However, for what it attempts to be - a good, likable video game - it delivers.<br><br><i>Review date:<\/i> 2nd December, 2015<br><i>Revision date:<\/i> 3rd December, 2015\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19432063', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19432063' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19432063\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19432063' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19432063\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19432063', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19432063_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19432063_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19800772\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/420770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOld school 2D platform games have certainly been in the forefront in recent years. Games like Shovel Knight, Mighty No. 9, and Azure Striker Gunvolt are some great examples of how this seemingly \u201cold school\u201d type of gaming is more popular than ever. Trying to join in on the excitement is The Legend of Dark Witch. Witchcraft combined with a bit of customization allows this game to have a unique spot in this genre of games for the Nintendo 3DS.<br><br>Circle Entertainment is a fairly new developer and publisher located in China that was founded in 2006. The company takes pride in themselves for utilizing the latest technology while keeping pace with the videogame industry. In addition, Circle Entertainment boasts that the average age for the company is only 25. Some of Circle Entertainment\u2019s recent games include Theological July, Bridal June, Knytt Underground, and Demon King Box.<br><br>Right off the bat, the storyline is not explicitly told. Players just start playing and eventually get snippets of what is going on in the world they\u2019re playing in. Essentially, Syega Crystals, items that provide the power to all magical creatures in the world have gone missing. Your character, Zizou, a dark witch herself, must retrieve the missing Syega Crystals to bring balance to this mystical world. Unfortunately, the story isn\u2019t anything new and is very cursory. Little to no depth of it is explored, and quite frankly, unentertaining.<br><br>However, what was entertaining was the presentation of the game. The simple, yet well crafted, graphics of the game makes it at the very least a nice game to look at. Each stage has its own theme (library, fighting arena, etc.), with specific enemies, hazards, and unique music that directly tie into the stage you are currently battling through. The first stage, for example, is the library. Some enemies you face include a librarian, falling books, and a one-eyed book who launches pages at you. The music is pretty casual with nothing fast-paced. I\u2019ve heard that libraries were a place of terror, so I suppose casual music with attacking books sounds about right.<br><br>Since this is a ported game from Japan, there are voice actors who, logically, speak in Japanese. This is nothing new since it is very expensive to hire more voice actors. Consequently, the text that translates the banter back-and-forth works just fine.<br><br>Like any typical 2D platform game, the objective is to get from one side of the stage all the way to the other. Sounds easy, right? Well if it does, you can adjust the gameplay with three different difficulties - Easy, Normal, and Lunatic. In addition, players can decide how they want to \u201cinstall\u201d upgrades to their character - auto (game selects which attributes to boost), semi-auto, and manual (complete autonomy). These customizations of gameplay, right in the beginning, can offer unique experiences to each player, in addition to some nice replayability.<br><br>Players then use the A\/X\/B\/Y buttons to either jump, attack, switch attacks, or utilize a special attack. At first, I was a little annoyed by the pre-designated button assignments, but quickly found out that you can customize it. The top screen offers the actual gameplay of your character, the world, and enemies. The bottom screen shows your health, lives, Tres (the currency you obtain from defeating enemies), and time. The presentation of the bottom screen was perfectly done - it\u2019s a great layout that ensures that the top screen isn\u2019t cluttered with an abundance of information. In addition, there is an electronic manual that you can access throughout the game - a handy thing in case you want some clarification for something on the screen.<br><br>Something that irked me about the gameplay is that you can just hold down the attack button and destroy any enemy without thought. The button-smashing-esque combat can get very old very quickly. If you like that type of gameplay, then this is fine, but for wants a little bit more thought in their fighting can find this terribly boring. There are also no opportunities to replenish your health. Ever. So you either have to die to get full health for the boss, or go through the level without taking damage\u2026.an obvious flaw and annoying concept for sure.<br><br>Unfortunately, I was disappointed by The Legend of Dark Witch. The 2D platform action genre has some innovative and creative games. I always want to give indie games a chance, but the lack of story, intrigue, and overall appeal with this game simply made it unintriguing. The customization is a nice touch, but ultimately cannot save the game from a poor overall performance. Overall 5\/10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19800772', 'summary' );

For speedrunning it is increadibly satisfying, and even on Easy it presents a good challenge trying to go for a fast time. For the casuals it presents a good challenge as well if you play on Normal (my first playthrough took 3-4h). And if you're really looking for a challenge there's Lunatic. There's also a 2nd playable character with new abilities and a much harder final boss fight.<br>The music is really catchy and the characters are very cute.<br>If you like games that plays like the classic Megaman games, I highly recommend this to you.<br>I've spent nearly 100h on this game on my 3DS and I know I'm gonna spend a fair amount of time on this version too.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19434545', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19434545' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19434545\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19434545' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19434545\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19434545', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19434545_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19434545_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29520709\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anitude\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"74040969\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/232f660a2bc45e052476dd96eaef7e72450be839.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/232f660a2bc45e052476dd96eaef7e72450be839.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/232f660a2bc45e052476dd96eaef7e72450be839_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Anitude\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74040969\">Annie T.

The menu interface shows controller buttons and the only keyboard related thing on the interface is to tell you how to close the game through ALT+F4 since there's no exit game option. You can rebind the keys but only through rebinding the controller controls, as that's the only way to rebind anything for some reason. And even then you can only rebind the face buttons.<br><br>Three difficulty options are available; Easy, Normal, and Lunatic. Going up a difficulty setting has bosses and some enemies attack faster &amp; put more projectiles on the screen as well as increasing their defense though you take the same amount of damage all the same. Because of their bigger defense it's highly inadvisable to start the game off on Lunatic as all bosses just take way too long to kill as a result and likely much longer if you don't know what they do. You can only pick up health on Easy mode as well.<br><br>The gameplay's simplistic in its run-n-shoot mechanics. You can shoot almost as fast as you press the button, killing most enemies in one hit. <br>The screen however is pretty small so constantly running to progress can be consequential and the camera can move a bit slow when turning around. For example there are a few enemies that instantly shoot a projectile your way if you kill it instantly, so if you happen to shoot one off-screen you'll need to be quick about dodging or blocking it. It doesn't help too that some enemies regularly fire projectiles off-screen if you're close enough. This goes for enemies at the bottom as well so it's almost a guessing game of whether or not you'll drop down only to get hit by something that was already thrown or fired. Looking at the manual, the camera disadvantage seems to be intentional as they tell you to &quot;try to remember where your enemies appear&quot;. It'd be fine if some parts weren't guessing games. There's a setting in the options menu that lets you choose where you want the camera constantly positioned to the character and how fast you want it to scroll towards the direction you're facing. No matter what setting I pick though the camera always moves very slowly for me so I just have the camera almost center to the character and chose the option for the camera to barely scroll anywhere.<br><br>Blocking in the game is tough, quick, &amp; precise but it's rewarding as it not only negates damage, it also gives you a small amount of Tres. <br>You can block just about anything, even environmental hazards. It's tough in the sense that you have to press left or right just as an attack of some kind is about to hit you, even if you go towards it yourself. It's completely optional but learning how to block what can be well worth it.<br><br>Throughout the game you collect Tres from killing enemies, damaging bosses, blocking, and by just starting up a stage. They immediately separate themselves into two different functions, as permanent currency and a means to fill up the Enhancement Slot bar.<br>In the stage select screen you can use Tres to purchase permanent upgrades for yourself. <br>During actual gameplay you have access to an Enhancement Slot bar at the bottom of the screen where you can use Tres to temporarily acquire and\/or upgrade some skills on the spot. I found myself only acquiring\/upgrading three of the upgrades though; one that increases my movement speed, one that keeps me in the air a bit longer, and one that increases damage.<br>Moving faster means upgrading the first slot, Speed, which I only ever upgrade once or twice as I feel I  won't have too much control of my character if she's too fast. Wing keeps me in the air a bit longer if I hold the jump button midair though I ever only upgrade it once as I don't feel the need to be in the air for longer than a second. The damage increaser, Power, I always try to max out as that seems to be the most useful for the stage and the end-boss. The upgrades for adding more projectiles to your firing, Line &amp; Comet, seems good for the stages but impractical for bosses. Line is straightforward in adding an upward shot attack to my default straight attack but Comet adds an attack that swerves up &amp; down too much to really be useful. Upgrading either projectile-adding attack more than once feels like a waste of Tres. And then there's a hidden upgrade, Guard, which can only be acquired once and can't be upgraded, is meant to instantly negate one damage that hits you before disappearing. Afterwards you'll need to rack up enough Tres to reacquire it. It's extremely useful but it's incredibly pricey.<br>Getting hurt lowers your currently filled Enhancement Slot bar by a certain amount depending on the difficulty setting chosen and dying removes all the acquired skills from it. No matter what though the currency part stays with you even if you abruptly choose to go to the stage select screen.<br><br>Each stage has their own unique enemies as well as a few re-used ones and the maps are relatively small with a few forked paths you can take. Even on a first try you can probably get to the boss in around 3-5 minutes each stage. The music isn't bad and the platforming is pretty basic though some sections are a bit tougher than others.<br><br>You can find two hidden items per stage (save for the last two stages) called &quot;Pure Syega&quot; which you'll find by jumping around everywhere, shooting everywhere to find an indication that you hit something invisble, or checking online where they're at. They're supposed to further increase the amount of times you can upgrade something on the Enhancement Slot bar but if you're only using a few of the upgrades on it then the Pure Syegas are mostly useless.<br><br>The bosses in each stage are all unique &amp; simple. Their attacks are unique and they all attack in specific, predictable patterns which you're supposed to use against them. Each one only does two attacks on their first phase. As their health reach certain points they'll add new attacks to their patterns but even then it's not adding a whole lot. Regardless, it can still be difficult to avoid damage as you'll still have to find a way to constantly avoid getting hit. There aren't any indications as to when they'll start changing up their attacks aside from looking at how low their health is. Because each boss is fought on one screen it's pretty easy to not be distracted by their health bar. For whatever reason almost all of the bosses stay in the same spot where their only other movement is to float straight up in the air for a bit. Only two of them are actually capable of moving from one side of the screen to another.<br>Once a boss is beaten you get an attack of theirs for you to use. Each boss is weak to another's attack like a rock-paper-scissor mechanic of sorts and of course each one is beatable with the basic attack. These special attacks use up Tres from the Enhancement Slot bar though. If it's empty then you automatically switch to your basic attack.<br><br>Once the game's through you gain access to another smug character on a New Game, who's significantly harder to use as her default projectile range is near point blank in the beginning and most of her Enhancement Slot upgrades are near useless, some even detremental. Beating the game with her though reveals what's supposedly the true ending to the game's plot, which was pretty simplistic and straightforward to begin with.<br><br>For what was I think originally a 3DS title it's not a bad port if you can somehow get by the lack of attention for keyboard play as well as some other minor issues. At $5 it's a pretty decent &amp; tough platformer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29520709', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29520709' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29520709\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29520709' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29520709\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29520709', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29520709_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29520709_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25810740\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/raiinbowdash\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"84019733\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46b96050bc8842ef021c63c5b515446668ea6990.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46b96050bc8842ef021c63c5b515446668ea6990.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46b96050bc8842ef021c63c5b515446668ea6990_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/raiinbowdash\/\" data-miniprofile=\"84019733\">Rainbow Dash<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/raiinbowdash\/games\/?tab=all\">497 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/raiinbowdash\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/raiinbowdash\/recommended\/420770\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game oscillates so much between nice and dumb things. The bosses fights are soemwhat nice but everyhing that is before it feels completely lazy, dull and useless and put there for the sake of not having just boss fights. The levels consist of a single path and an additionnal &quot;hidden&quot; area and two hidden things to gather to unlock more power, usually found in unfair and lame traps that will make you replay the entire level just for them, if you can find them. It's lame because you can't really find them even when entering the alternative path so you just shoot at everything you can while spamming your jump.<br><br>So, for the levels themselves, without bosses ; well it's just bad. You just run from left to right killing things and that's it. There is no fun platforming and not much of fun enemy fighting. They can be easy to beat or hard and then it's just because they are lame and kill you unfairly because you can't expect them or they respawned behind you. To describe how the levels are stupid, just know that the &quot;first&quot; one (there is no actual mandatory order, you can choose to play the first available levels freely) makes you gather keys to unlock doors blocking your path. And how did they make this ? One key is just above a door that you have to jump on some platforms above to get and then you come down and that's it. ALL the others are just right IN FRONT of the doors. WTF ? WHY ? Why the hell would you put a door in the first place if it's to put the key unlocking it right before it IN A SINGLE STRAIGHT AND UNIQUE PATH ? You just run to the right and your character picks up the key and then go through the door ! That's just completely dumb.<br><br>The energy system feels very restrictive and punishing more than helping. As you gather power from defeated enemies you may unlock temporary abilities and power ups, in a set order and while a block of power is fully charged and before the next one is. So say you got Speed \/ Wings \/ Line \/ Comet \/ Power and the bar is completely filled up to Wings and half Line, then you unlock Wings when activating it. If it's filled up to Speed and half to Wing, then you unlock Speed when activating it. The Line and Comet are two different types of bullets your character kills the enemies with, and Power adds more power to the current bullet type in use. But if you pick up Line while you were in Comet, it becomes Line lv 1 no matter what level Comet was, and same for Line to Comet. So that's an actual downgrade you have to work, and grind for thorough the level, making the monsters respawn to buff yourself before fighting the boss. And if you die, you lose all these upgrades and have to unlock them again by grinding enemies all over again or when hitting a boss..<br><br>And that's not it. You unlock more bullet types from defeated bosses. The problem is that they are clunky to use AND deplete your energy bar very fast ! So you just have to stick to Line or Comet forever and eventually use the additionnal bullet types on boss fights only..<br><br>As for the boss themselves, it's a bit mixed. They can be very stupidly unfair, throwing attacks with no landmark or anything (like the cat girl), and once you know their patterns they're a walk in the park and you can beat them in mere seconds without any upgrade at all, at least for the first ones, as the following are just plain lame and unfair. They have different patterns that change and &quot;improve in power&quot; as the fight goes and they happen randomly, either by the action the boss chooses to take, or by the action itself that has many different possible patterns in itself, so it's not always the same thing and it always stays fresh.<br><br>So this game is not that bad, the boss fights are Ok and some people will find them challenging. There is replayability through in-game achievements (on the 3DS version too) that challenge you with diverse goals and it's not your usual &quot;Launch the game&quot; or &quot;Do an attack&quot; kind of achievements. The graphics and musics are nice and chara design is Ok. But the levels feel very uninspired, lazy and unnecessary, so much that they just look like cheap placeholders, along with the power up system, to wrap the bosses with, and I find that disappointing a lot because the game visually looks nice and the musics are cool and would have been so much better with decent levels and more depht instead of these failed stuffs.<br><br>There are other annoying things such as the camera.. ooh I hate that camera. It takes aaaaaaaaages for it to scroll while the game expects you to react fast to things and actually is a part of why the game is lame since the enemies take advantage of it to throw stuffs at you when you can't see it ! They did put options with two variables for the camera but neither of them fixes anything.. We need to unlock the Hard difficulty so it's a bit annoying too but since it's different from normal.. it's Ok I guess. And we are able to block projectiles with some kind of jump but the game does not explains well how to do it and what is a &quot;projectile&quot; according to it so you happen to save your encounter with a fortunate block that you did not even mean in the first place, but you don't really try to use it on purpose. I personally just dodge everything and it seems like the game works with that, so there is not even a need to block stuffs.<br><br>I find that the game is a big disappointment and has many flaws but at the same time it's cute and it's just enough for it to have some sort of fun and replayability and the bosses save everything. I would have liked more depth into the game universe via levels that don't feel like an insult like &quot;just so we can say we did some stuff&quot;, with actual platforming and things to explore and unlock in them, with several paths (more than one and a single alternative, usually behind a trap that hides a crystal) and enemies that are not insanely lame and I get hit because I have to. <br><br>Also having to pay money to have the game musics as playable files is very low and lame. That thing should just be illegal that's it. It shows even more they cared more about money and quantity than quality.<br><br>All in all it's a nice little game that looks promising but sadly lacks of a lot of content and consistence and has several annoying flaws.

Gameplay consists of the weakness-finding run and gun platforming of Megaman paired with the powerup system of Gradius. This added a lot more depth to the game than I thought it would, as you can only power up so much and are required to choose those upgrades that will not only get you through the level, but also the boss at the end. It's a pretty tough platformer, requiring you to memorize map layout and enemy locations just like the good old days, and it also sports a series of unlockables and Easter eggs to bolster replay value. If there's any criticism to be levied against this game, it's that the boss powers seemed to be an afterthought and proved unnecessary for the most part. When all's said and done, though, The Legend of Dark Witch is a charming, challenging, and fundamentally sound platformer, and a great value for the asking price of $4.99.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19541323', 'summary' );

It requires quite a bit of trial and error, but every hazard and enemy is introduced at least once in a safe enviroment. Upgrades are available if you get stuck, but the entire game can be beaten without using any.<br><br>Most of the games more unique elements complement its style of difficulty. Defeated enemies (and some destructable hazards) will yield &quot;tres&quot; that will fill the install gauge. By pressing the assigned button after the gauge is sufficiently full you can boost various parameters (for example movement speed and shot power) , alter your abilities (your default shot can become a spread shot in this way), or even gain new ones (specifically a glide skill). If you take damage you will lose half of your tres, but you will only lose the upgrades if you die or start a new stage. This mechanic rewards good gameplay and gives you incentive to dodge besides evading damage. On the note of damage, you can also block by pressing forward or backward a fraction of a second before you take damage. The timing is very stringent, so blocking will often only be a last resort, but with practice it becomes easier. This mechanic makes the trial and error element a little less punishing. If an attack catches you of guard (as they often will) you can block even if its to late to jump.  <br><br>The games graphics and sound are consistent, and it manages to stay visually interesting all throughout. The music is catchy and the tracks are long enough that few will loop more than once before you finish a segment. The game also has various unlockable gallaries of in game assets, often with creator commentary. <br><br>If I had to criticize one element of the game it would be technical skills. After defeating a boss, you'll earn a technical skill. These act as alternate shots that other bosses are weak against. My problem is that they are USELESS.  All, except one, start out useless against every enemy except the bosses they are effective against. One of the worst skills will create a tornado where you stand. Then the tornado will proceed to stand there. It won't move forward, and without upgrades it won't extend high enough to hit most airborne enemies. You'll have to place it right in front of an enemy and hope that it materialises before you get hit. And that it doesn't fizzle out before an enemy touches it.  Worse still, using the useless skills isn't even free. Every time you use a technical skill it will cost you some tres, meaning that you risk losing access to useful abilites everytime you use a technical skill. On the flip side installing also means less tres for technical skills. The worst part is that you won't gain tres for enemies you defeat with technical skills. Add a dash of trial and error and you have a recipe for disaster against most bosses. <br><br>That said I still think it's a good game overall. If you can bear the frustration of failure the fruits of success will be yours. <br><br>Eventually...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30047991', 'recent_short' );
