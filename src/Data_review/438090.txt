Tom Fulp has founded <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/Newgrounds.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Newgrounds.com<\/a> and it is soon flooded with the latest and greatest content created by the advanced and artistic tools named &quot;Flash&quot; and &quot;Shockwave&quot;. It is not long until the site grows to immense popularity, forming a culture of its own. Many games would reach internet fame based on their sheer creativity and of course, fun.<br><br>Defend Felinearth is kinda like those games except it's not one of the good ones. It's one the flash games that you'd probably have to sort by popularity, and then go to the last page. That's okay though, because this game really isn't that bad. I mean, it's bad in the sense that compared to other things it's definitely not going to hold up just because from a composition standpoint, it's a bit lackluster in about every department. But if I were to be locked up in a jail cell and I had a computer with literally just Defend Felinearth on it, I probably wouldn't complain.<br><br>The game features some Japanese cat people that would fit perfectly in a Sonic the Hedgehog DeviantArt fanfic comic, whom I can only assume, have been recruited to defend their home planet from miscellaneous stock Gamemaker sprites invading the nearby space area thing. You're equipped with a cool ship that can fire lasers, and if you murder, or get murdered enough, sometimes you can shoot off a bomb or whatever super dope weapon you've unlocked by playing the game enough, which murders even more.<br><br>The gameplay is very simple, it's a run-of-the-mill space area shooter, taking place on one 2D screen with an animated background. When I was a kid I had an old Apple something or rather, maybe it was a Macintosh by then. I think it was. Anyways I had this game called PegLeg. It was very similar to this, and it was really cool. My dad and I liked playing it a lot. It had some pretty funny sounds and graphics for the time. Check it out if you can, and let me know if you get it running, I'd like to come over.<br><br>By the way this game only features voice work in Japanese and Mandarin, so if your dirty filthy baka gaijin American pig ears cannot understand either of those languages, then perhaps you are better off committing seppuku you ignorant uncultured swine.<br><br>It's got some unlockables and a sense of progression through experience points and new characters, which in turn offer new ships and equipment to vary up gameplay. If you're a big fan of whatever stuff and you like the things in the video game then you will definitely do actions to complete your collection of cat humans and something.<br><br>Overall, Defend Felinearth is pretty bad and I would definitely not spend money on it pretty much ever in my life and would exclusively only come to own it through a bundle or a gift. However the game is not broken or buggy so I can't really give it a negative score, because it clearly advertises what it is and if you buy it thinking it's going to be anything else, then you should really evaluate your observation skills and get a refund. Maybe consider bettering yourself. Maybe take up learning Japanese, or Mandarin! That would be good for you. You know, learning another language can show a great deal of character in a person. It represents discipline, culture, and even how dang to heck smart you are. Girls love guys who are fluent in Japanese, because then you can precisely and coherently describe and discuss your favorite animes, especially ones about cats defending their Felinearth.<br><br>By the way if this review offends you in any way, then you are VERY IGNORANT and you should be ASHAMED because I sexually identify as a Catkin that is VERY adamant about defending my friends AND my Felinearth. So if you ever so as much BULLY me or my FELINENDS (that's feline friends, you scum!) then you will be REPORTED and DEALT with, because believe me, our claws are fiercer than your tongue, dookus!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23494315', 'summary' );
