When it mysteriously appeared in the New Releases here on Steam, I knew without a doubt I needed to play it again.  However, as I booted up this classic, I questioned just what was it about the game that left such a mark on my memory; the artwork is good, but it\u2019s nothing that stands out among others in the genre (or even the series itself), and the gameplay is your typical HOPA-fare.  But as I stepped into the agency investigator\u2019s shoes yet again, this time with a few years of HOG-playing experience under my belt, I was better equipped to pick out all the things that make this title one of the best the genre has to offer. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=734344930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=734344930<\/a><br>Set in the post WWI era, the Agency of Anomalies has been contacted by one Dr. Oliver Orvos, a German doctor, scientist, and the sole survivor of a horrific incident that occurred 10 years prior at a top secret military hospital.  Recent events lead him to believe that a dimensional vortex may surface at the abandoned installation, and he\u2019s in desperate need of someone to investigate and deter this paranormal phenomenon before it risks tearing apart the very fabric of existence itself!  As the Agency\u2019s top investigator, you must uncover the hospital\u2019s secrets in order to prevent a world-ending cataclysm.  Nope, this isn\u2019t your typical HOG story, but that\u2019s one of the things I enjoy so much about it.  One can only take so many haunted houses and magical fantasy worlds before boredom sets in.   Traversing this abandoned military facility is a welcome divergence from the stereotypically colorful settings that fill the genre these days. <br><br>Gameplay itself is pretty standard \u201cadventure lite\u201d fare, but it\u2019s the little details that make it stand out.  The addition of secret animations that play on certain clicked items breathe life and atmosphere into the empty world, even if they\u2019re only tricks of the Agent\u2019s mind.   I also appreciate the era appropriate items in the hidden object scenes which help immerse the player in the time period.  The scenes themselves are well composed with plenty of objects to search through, but nothing so obscured as to feel unfairly hidden, that is as long as one has enough patience to look carefully.  The item that is to be added to your inventory is the final one to appear on your list after all others are found, which makes it feel as if there\u2019s a purpose to searching through all that junk.  Although it\u2019s such a little thing, it adds a lot. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=733423166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=733423166<\/a><br>But above all else, it\u2019s the writing that distinguishes Mystic Hospital from the rest.  The main character is written so well, his personality oozes from the commentary and journal entries.  You can tell this is a guy who\u2019s seen it all, nothing phases him, and he\u2019s gonna finish the job no matter what it takes.  He\u2019s witty and sarcastic and dangit, I wish he had a name, but I\u2019ll just have to settle for Agent.  <br><br>Then there\u2019s the patient files which are narrated by the good doctor, giving us an interesting glimpse into the experiments performed on the hospital patients which ultimately lead to catastrophe.  The voice actor does a wonderful job of describing the events that took place without hamming it up with the usual HOG camp.  The inclusion of beautifully painted, sepia-colored art pieces serve as a pleasing complement, and contrast, to the grittiness of the rest of the game's graphics.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=739306365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=739306365<\/a><br>As much as I loved the main adventure, it pains me to note how disappointing the bonus chapter was.   Usually these extra snippets give additional background into the plot and characters, but it merely included a few documents hinting at the sequel, and not much beyond that.  This would have been fine should the gameplay have been engaging enough, but the additional play time was padded with so many hidden object scenes that even I had grown weary of them towards the end.  I still recommend playing through it, because why not?  But I really wish we would\u2019ve been given more information on the hospital, the villain, or even the protagonist himself.  <br><br>Small grievances aside, Mystic Hospital remains one of the best HOGs I\u2019ve played.  Perhaps the artwork and premise may not appeal to those used to more brightly painted titles, but the gameplay, atmosphere and writing is truly some of the best I\u2019ve come across in the genre.  I certainly hope the rest of the series makes it over, as I cannot wait to experience more of this Agent\u2019s paranormal adventures.   <br><br>Bottom Line: Highly Recommended.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24781417', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24781417' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24781417\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24781417' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24781417\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24781417', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24781417_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24781417_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/503060\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24781417"]}
