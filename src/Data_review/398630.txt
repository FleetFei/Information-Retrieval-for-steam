What secret will he discover?<br><br>The plot of the first game is perhaps basic but with all the questions arising during your quest and the fact you're seeing ghosts, you bet that there is a dark cult under it. Though the end tells you how Mark came on the Island, which is a shocking twist, playing it a second time had made more understanding of the story than the first time. The graphics are correct, the soundtrack is also too, but the problem is that you're doing a lot of backtracking for an object. You may not understand why a cruise boat from 2008 managed to get lost on an island left behind during the '20 but the bonus chapter is showing you a tourist that escaped monsters and that sent a SOS to the ship, which in turn, got sucked into the poisonous ambiance.<br><br>Twisted Lands: Insomniac is putting you in the mind of Angel Brown, found ashore and severely traumatized, so badly that she is in a psychiatric institute. You need to escape the hospital but each time you're sedated, you're sent back to the island that made you suffered. You're discovering a new side of it, but also, the why of the tourist in the bonus chapter from the first game.<br><br>The plot is alternating between your mind and the hospital, which is a good idea. Yet, the fate of Angel and Mark, her husband, is still kinda blurry: while Mark is probably dead since all this time, you don't know about Angel. The ending is an echo to what she dreamed.<br><br>Graphics are good, though they reused some ghosts from the first game. The soundtrack is correct. The puzzles are not too hard, though some of them are a real challenge, as in the previous story.<br><br>The bonus chapter is introducing you in the why of the island was infected, as it's more and more obvious that it was an experiment gone wrong - seen through the eyes of Teresa.<br><br>Twisted Lands: Origin is making visit the island in the '20, as a detective sent by Teresa's father. Given the fact that her husband is the culprit behind the infection of the island and that their son and she are prisoners, you'll need to rescue them and any people not infected. In the end, you're discovering the story of the ancestors of the tourist from 2008... and also how some scenes in the first game became like that.<br><br>The plot is alright but I found this one a little too long for my taste. Besides, there was some problems: my mouse was sometimes going where it shouldn't, I managed to get back to my desk twice by clicking I don't know where AND the most annoying point is the inventory bar that isn't locked: IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT APPEAR - ONLY WAY: TO USE THE HINT BUTTON AND LOCK IT! And good luck when you're unlocking it because you need to click in the area. <br><br>Graphics are correct, soundtrack too. The HO scene changed from the other games as objects you need to find by moving stuff appear. Puzzles aren't too hard too.<br><br>In the end, the trilogy is a nice thing to have, though I find the price high for it, wait for a discount for them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19016334', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19016334' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19016334\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19016334' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19016334\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19016334', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19016334_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19016334_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24203456\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"82565658\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/11\/118cd305015c42ef91a49f523cfd0a8af6404cc1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82565658\">talgaby<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/games\/?tab=all\">425 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/recommended\/\">354 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/talgaby\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall: 53%<\/div>With one boring, one half-decent, and one semi-enjoyable game in this package, Twisted Lands Trilogy will hardly be the crown jewel of a hidden object gamer\u2019s library. Still, if you can get it very cheap, try the last game, as it is the only one that is worth any notice.<br><br><b><u>Twisted Lands: Shadow Town: 40%<\/u><\/b><br>Probably the only good thing about Shadow Town is that it looks amazing for its age\u2014because as a HOG, it is terrible and boring: endless walking around in circles, with hidden object scenes reused so often that you\u2019ll know the item placements by heart.<br><br>There is also barely any story: we play as a man trying to find his wife after they were shipwrecked on an abandoned island. There is next to no plot between the intro and the ending (although the latter one is quite clever).<br><br><b><u>Twisted Lands: Insomniac: 51%<\/u><\/b><br>Insomniac is an improved carbon copy of Shadow Town with a lot less repetition, but a copy nonetheless: it even reuses many of the previous game\u2019s assets.<br><br>To its credit, it at least tries to tell a story. Sure, it was ripped straight from Silent Hill 2\u2014same premise, same revelation, even the same \u201creal world\/nightmare world\u201d pairing\u2014but playing as the wife we were looking for through the first game as she tries to escape a mental hospital finally gives some motivation to stay in the game.<br><br><b><u>Twisted Lands: Origin: 68%<\/u><\/b><br>Origin is a prequel, this time with a plot similar to Resident Evil 2: we play as an investigator, who arrives just in time to witness the outbreak that turned into the inhabitants of the island to those monsters we saw in the previous games, trying to save the child of the scientist who caused the trouble.<br><br>Almost all game mechanics and gameplay elements were replaced, from the user interface to the graphical style. All that remained was the reuse of the same hidden object scenes, but apart from that, Origin is just a typical average HOG. Strangely, this is why it is probably the most enjoyable of the pack.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24203456', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24203456' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24203456\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24203456' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24203456\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24203456', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24203456_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24203456_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21036266\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970078168\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"9812440\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcf97bc72e8fbb27c4bcbdc311e513f53c63bb72.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcf97bc72e8fbb27c4bcbdc311e513f53c63bb72.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcf97bc72e8fbb27c4bcbdc311e513f53c63bb72_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970078168\/\" data-miniprofile=\"9812440\">hermetico<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970078168\/games\/?tab=all\">801 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970078168\/recommended\/\">326 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970078168\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNot bad for the price but, the only of the three games I've really enjoyed was the &quot;Origins&quot; one. <br>It seems the most round title, with some original puzzles and a good balance between story, puzzles and hidden object scenes.<br>The other two titles are reusing some scenarios from the first one and have less interest, in my opinion.<br>Someone should explain to developers that Spain ISN'T Mexico or South America!!!.<br>Names and family names are ridiculous, landscape and scenarios have no semblance with Spanish ones.<br>I am missing some map with quick jump from scene to scene.

The games are Hidden Object games. The overall difficulty of all three parts is ok and you'll have a help function, if you get stuck.<br><br>The Story:<br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Shadow Town<\/div>Mark Brown, a tourist and hobby treasure hunter, and his girlfriend Angel are swept ashore of an unknown island near Spain after a promising treasure diving that somehow went wrong. When Mark regains conciousness, he realizes that Angel went missing and later discovers that she realy got kidnapped. The Island is somehow disturbing as it is on no maps and always under a layer of fog. Although there is a small town and even a modern looking ship in the harbour, there is now sign of any living person. In fact, the original inhabitants of the small town seem to have disappeared around 1921 when something happend that made some people go mad or simple disappear. The ship in the harbour is also deserted although it has come to the island not very long ago to follow a distress signal.<br>You'll have to discover as much as possible about the past events and rescue Angel.<br><br>Shadow Town also contains a bonus chapter after you've beaten the main game where you play the person who sent the distress signal that lured the ship into the harbour. Still it remains unclear how said person came to the island and why.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Insomniac<\/div>In this game you play as Angel, girlfriend of the character in the first part. Angel was (again) swept ashore and seems to have lost her wits due to the events in the first part. She has been brought to a hospital or, to be more specific, to a mental asylum. The game jumps back and forth between short scenes where Angel tries to escape the asylum (in modern days) and long episodes where she explores the twisted island from the first part, although the story is rather blurry and it remains unclear (at least to me) if one of those two settings or even both are just in Angels imagination. At least, the game explains the presence of the main character of the first part's bonus chapter.<br><br>Insomniac again has a bonus chapter where you play a women called Terese that lived on the island in 1920, when the evil started to spread on the island. This bonus chapter tries to explain the events on a more scientific basis as <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> some experiments gone wrong<\/span><\/span> which is not a big spoiler as you can guess this at the very beginning of this bonus chapter...<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Origins<\/div>The third part tries to clear some of the yet unsolced questions from the first two parts. This time you don't play in modern times, but in 1921 when a private detective was sent to the island by Terese's father to find out why she didn't write a letter in the past three month. The moment the detective arrives on the island the evil events are already in progress. Only very few residents of the island are still there but compared to the first two parts with no character interaction at all, the town really seems somehow alive. Now, finding Terese is not too much of a problem, but you'll soon realize that everyone still on the island, including you, is in big danger, and you'll have to find a way to flee. You'll even find the origins of the main person of the first part's bonus chapter. In the end, there are still some questions unanswered, but as the triology ends here and there is no bonus chapter this time, we'll have to live with that.<br><br>As all three games are quite similar, I can sum up the pros and cons for all of them.<br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Very good atmosphere<br><\/li><li>Well balanced difficulty level<br><\/li><li>Challenging puzzles<br><\/li><li>Dense storyline<br><\/li><li>Music and grafics are not overly good but fit the setting<br><\/li><li>Recognizable locations and the mostly coherent subplots of the islands inhabitants, so you'll feel all three parts are games of the same installment (not like many sequels of other games...)<br><\/li><li>All three parts have a journal and part two and three even a ToDo-list, so you don't have to write things down on your own<\/li><\/ul><br><b>Cons<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Many hidden object scenes are reused (up to three times) which can get annoying<br><\/li><li>There is much running back and forth between some locations included as you only can do or take some things after triggering events and only the third part has a map and you'll have no means to fast-travel from one location to another, so you'll spend much time on simply running around.<br><\/li><li>There are still some inconsistencies and some open questions in the end.<\/li><\/ul><br>There are no real jump scares included, but some scenes that may come a little unexpected, you'll see some dead people with really horrific background stories as <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> a pregnant women immured in her room alive that starved to death <\/span><\/span> and the games are still horror games. So you'll have to decide for yourself if this is something you can handle or not.<br><br>Overall, I can recommend this games. You might want to wait for a discount though, because 20\u20ac for roughly 10 hours of gameplay are not overly much but also not in the low budget category.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20702038', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20702038' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20702038\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20702038' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20702038\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20702038', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20702038_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20702038_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22277381\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75520107\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75520107\">shiaakuma<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/games\/?tab=all\">923 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/recommended\/\">92 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is quite a good series of games.<br><br>VIsuals, graphics, and music are all the usual HO-game fare, nothing special and nothing too poor.  Minigames are engaging and rarely too annoying and the hidden-object scenes themselves are detailed and crisp.  Objects are not too challenging to find but they aren't too easy either.  It's a good mix.<br><br>Of the three games, I enjoyed the second the most, but they were all enjoyable.  While the plot isn't the pinnacle of literature (and what HO game offers such a plot?), I was engaged by the plot continuing through the three games and I enjoyed it as the various pieces of the plot-puzzle clicked into place as the games progressed.  I found myself genuinely curious about what was happening and how it was going to turn out.<br><br>There is only one really noticeable downside in my opinion, and that is the lack of a map.  Each game has a pretty extensive area to cover and there is a lot of backtracking, so a map would have been helpful, especially with what I call the &quot;zoom zoom&quot; function to jump across the map if necessary.  In games with this much area and as much backtracking as there is, not having that ability is a little annoying.<br><br>There are some other things missing that other games offer, such as achievements and extra items to find (for example, the &quot;find all 18 seahorses&quot; sort of extra goals).  This doesn't impact the game in the least, just something to keep in mind if you like very complex games with a lot of extras.<br><br>Game length is average for this genre, at about three hours per game and some extra time for the bonus chapters.  If you normally buy this type of game at full price, it's a decent deal; if not, it's certainly worth wishlisting and waiting on a sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22277381', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22277381' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22277381\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22277381' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22277381\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22277381', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22277381_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22277381_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22487143\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wereboar129\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"86141548\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d547f98868bf6f55cd96da13ca79b7097ba0344.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d547f98868bf6f55cd96da13ca79b7097ba0344.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d547f98868bf6f55cd96da13ca79b7097ba0344_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wereboar129\/\" data-miniprofile=\"86141548\">Wereboar<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wereboar129\/games\/?tab=all\">3,539 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wereboar129\/recommended\/\">174 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wereboar129\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">A Mystery case with some twists and turns<\/div><br>The triology includes three parts of Twisted Lands, only the first two parts are collectors Edition Games, but that suffices.<br><br><b>Graphics: ++<\/b> The graphics are artistic, well rendered and look even without aspect ratio very crisp.<br><br><b>Sound: +<\/b> Fitting sound, the sound transposes most of it's atmosphere over sound.<br><br><b>Playability: ++<\/b> The first two parts of the triology are actually nothing very special, the &quot;origins&quot; third part sets here for a good standard, nice and logically build puzzles and riddles which are still challenging, the HOG's aren't overcrowded, yet they can give you some time to solve. This set actually plays at times like an adventure light game, especially on the third part this becomes true.<br><br>Genre Typical Values:<br><br><b>Story: ++<\/b> This triology has the potential (sic) to gain maximum points in this category. But alone the potential isn't just enough. Still the story is great, if you wish to say it's a mixture of the Cthulhu Mythos beings Yig, some Shadow over Insmouth and H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen and of course Brian W. Aldiss Saliva Tree. The mix is what brings up some novelty thoughts, and makes the game in it's story worthwhile to play.<br><br><b>Technical Realisation: ++ <\/b> The game works like a charm, everything is in it's place and none of the games crashed during play. Especially fine is the fact that turning of the screen ratio isn't crippling the game. There are two Collectors Editions in this triology, the last game &quot;Origins&quot; is as it is perfect. The last part plays sometimes like an interactiv film, actually faking it, still the notion is very nice.<br><br><b>Extras: +<\/b> Yes, there are two collectors editions in this bundle. The last game is as it is, but to a collectors edition some nice adds would have been nice, like soundtrack (for MP3, Ringtone etc.), Wallpapers, and conceptuals. The last chapter would have been a brow raiser if there would have been set another &quot;Bonus Chapter&quot;, as the last game concludes the story without an open thread.<br><br><b><i>Overall Rating: 10 +<\/i><\/b> Actually the games are far from perfect, but they are a good rendition of possibilities, they tell a good story, they work perfectly and have added content. The riddles are as challenging as you wish them to be, but actually it would be great not to skip them, because they are all solvable with some work. For me it was fun to play them.<br><br><b>Value for Money: Low Moderate at 20 Bucks<\/b> Three games, all of them are good on the story side, nothing too pesky, the riddles are well thought, some of them aren't original others are just variations of known riddles or puzzles. You get three games for 20 Bucks, that is ok, if only the games would have a good replayability, which actually tends towards zero, and maybe just nostalgia or senility migh cause me to once again savour the nice story. If you are able, catch this Bundle somwhere in a sale, a voucher or in a bundle.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Unconditionally Recommended<\/div><br>The game has earned it's recommendation, because the story alone makes it a worthwhile waste of time. Besides the story, the graphics, the sound and the atmosphere as a whole is just a perfect fit. I can only congratulate the developement team, that reads older &quot;Fantasy-Science Fiction-Horror&quot;-Stories. I just had the feeling that Dagon, Mother Hydra or Yig would turn up in the game sooner or later. And just the reminder of the Saliva Tree was enough to keep me playing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22487143', 'summary' );

The bonus level is a little bit annoying but it's a nice addition and tells how a ship location became grounded on the island. The second game stars the other main character from the first game and where they ended up. Honestly this one is a bit better. Also the bonus level involves another character from the story. Honestly I like how your getting to see the history of this island from many perspectives. The third game origins is honestly meh It's better graphically i guess but I just don't like it nearly as much as the first 2. I'm not a huge fan of find 1 item, now find where it goes, the get the next item, ad nausium. I prefer to explore and find different things and then find where they go to proceed. It's still a good game, just the weakest one I think. I do like how all three games uses the same locations or variations of them. It's add a nice continuity. It's 3 games for the price of one so I would definately get it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30252275', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30252275' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30252275\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30252275' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30252275\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30252275', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30252275_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30252275_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22271802\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaotia\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"72534957\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/207afc507b50b23c4386b9617b9af516da31bddb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/207afc507b50b23c4386b9617b9af516da31bddb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/20\/207afc507b50b23c4386b9617b9af516da31bddb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaotia\/\" data-miniprofile=\"72534957\">Kaotia<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaotia\/games\/?tab=all\">386 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaotia\/recommended\/\">145 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kaotia\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA trilogy of Hidden Object games with a very interesting story that you'll learn playing each chapter impersonating a different character.

I should note I got this in a bundle so I didn't pay full price, I don't think 7 hours of gameplay across 3 games is worth the price. If you can get it on sale or in a bundle and like HOG games then yes it's worth it in my opinion.<br>There are three games in the bundle and there is a common thread between them, you'll find that you're back to familiar places you arleady visited in the other games but there's a reason for that and I won't spoil it. The stories aren't bad and there's a lot of reading in the forms of journals and diaries, I mean some are 20-30 pages of reading. <br>I did find the game pleasantly surprised me with the plot twists that I honestly did not see coming.<br>Graphics are decent for HOG games, not sure about the music as I always turn music off in most every game I play. <br>There are some decent puzzles involved and some repeat the puzzle but with different circumstances, so there is some bit of repetition.<br>My main gripe is that you will find yourself lost and not knowing what to do next, but you can click the hint thankfully. The next gripe I have is the items, there are things that will work jsut fine logically to do a task or complete a puzzle but it won't let you so you have to find the exact thing to do it.<br>The final small gripe I have is the hidden object parts and the descriptions just aren't accurate or what you would expect. Example find the flask, in one part of the game the flask is a lab beaker type flask, the next part of the game the flask is the type you would carry with you with alcohol in. The next example would be find the bandage, there are several types of what I would consider bandages in the picture but only one of them is the correct one so you just have to keep clicking on them each. You'll find plenty more of those types of things in the games puzzles.<br>Bottom line: If you like hidden object games and can get this deeply discounted or in a bundle then go for it but I would not pay full price as they're just too short for the price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22065906', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22065906' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22065906\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22065906' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22065906\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22065906', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22065906_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22065906_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26639314\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173457771\/recommended\/398630\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"213192043\">moon2stars<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 12.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is worth trying if you can get it on sale, otherwise try something else.
