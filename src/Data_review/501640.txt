I always intend to sort through it later and to arrange things.<br>Friends and family await the photos I took from that one event long ago where they want that cool picture from.<br>You get a really good interface to tag photos by category (red, blue, etc.) or rate them on a scale 1-5 or simply just tag them Flagged\/Rejected.<br><br>For the sorting possibilities you can either create one big project containing all of your images and tag photos to export them to their own directories (this is what I do), or you can create many small projects by event\/date and hand pick the photos that belong to this event and leave the original images in the same folder they were. You can then go on and export your project to Facebook or mail after you finish your edits.<br><br>Since I became a father I have not gotten a real chance to take my system camera out for a spin so I have not tried the lens correction. But I guess one can assume it is working as advertised. Perhaps I can update my review later when I get a chance. For now I bring the camera that fits in my pocket and is less expensive to replace if an accident happens, my phone.<br><br>While my own use case is mostly sorting and arranging images into albums there are some(quite many actually) features to enhance images.<br>I do not really approve of altering images after they have been taken (I prefer to shoot as many images as needed to get the one that is good) but sometimes there really is no other option.<br>For example you can build a panorama from multiple images or run face detection (and enhancing) on images.<br>One seemingly useful feature is the possibility to take several photos in a row when doing group portraits and then merge them to select the best face of each person and merge that into a final image and presto.. No more closed eyes!<br><br>One of those really cool features I found and tried out was content aware removal.<br>I tried it on an image of a guy sitting on a lawn and it took me about five seconds to highlight him and his shadow with the marker tool and then to press apply and see him and his shadow gone and replaced by grass. Although the grass was very flat and you could tell (if you look closely) that the image had been edited I figured, hey.. lets try to remove that flat grass as well and so I marked it and press the apply button. The results was scary good because now the flat grass was removed and replaced by taller grass just like the rest of the image had. I couldn't even see it had been edited even when I knew where the guy had been sitting and was looking for signs of edit in that region. I am truly amazed at how good these software tools have gotten over time. I think it will be a winner for those times when you want to take a photo of an object in a semi crowded area and you just can't get a break without a person walking into the shot. Well, now I can easily edit them out at home!<br><br>There are many more features to try out but this is a review, not a tutorial, so I will just post this already and say that I think this program has way more features than I think I will be able to take advantage of for my daily sorting and editing. That is a good thing cause it means I can grow into the program instead of outgrowing it! Definitely a thumbs up from me.<br><br>PS. At the time of writing this I have like 3-4 hours of using the program but the time reported by Steam is way less. There seems to be a bug with the time reported but that does not affect anything else than the &quot;time spent in program&quot; timer.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27262249', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27262249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27262249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27262249' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27262249\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27262249', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27262249_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27262249_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29320093\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198311894677\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"351628949\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/3153988f0e6e2f161f6a2fc841de749a3052b911.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/3153988f0e6e2f161f6a2fc841de749a3052b911.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/3153988f0e6e2f161f6a2fc841de749a3052b911_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198311894677\/\" data-miniprofile=\"351628949\">00 Critical<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198311894677\/games\/?tab=all\">63 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198311894677\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198311894677\/recommended\/501640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis a nice photo editor... but not a photo shop like program.
