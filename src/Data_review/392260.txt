Its flat 2D (not 3D or even full 3D) and may look old hat to some of todays modern players who are use to fancy graphics etc.<br>But, WHO CARES!<br>The graphics are big, bold, sharp, colourful, cartoon like and detailed with some lovely animations and on a resolution of 1360 x 768 that graphics are sharp and very clear.  The isometric view reminds of an old ZX spectrum game called Knightlore which was very popular at its time.  I love the design of the characters that I have met so far as well as the detailed dungeon walls, floors etc.  The animation is extremely good with humans eyes blinking, or the way the hero switches between weapons to the different creatures movement to the way they die.  When I first saw the size of the graphics it was BIG on my screen which was good because it makes the game much more claustrophobic as you only see a small section of the dungeon and you don't know what is in front of you.  As your hero moves sections of the dungeon falls away behind you as a new section rises up to meet you.  When playing the game you forget it is 2d because you are so engrossed with look and style of the game play especially when the manic battles occur.  Also because of the 2d aspect it mean it less strain of the computer system requirements and allows you to have battles with lots of monsters and animations flying back and forth with a fast, manic and smooth look.  The death animation of the creatures ranges from cute to funny to surprising.  Also the special ability that each creature has so far (Only seen a few) again ranges from very funny to amusing or even frustrating when your in battle, but that is part of the charm.  The town is nicely set out with a some nice animations.  But it is the dungeon where the action takes place and thrill seeing a new creature with special abilities.<br>Score (9\/10)<br><br>Sound\/Music<br>The sounds effects are nice with some nice touches.  I like the sound of the shadowlord dying, or when splodges hit your monitor before sliding down with a squeakily sound effect.  The music is nice and I have a favourite track which takes place in the dungeon.  This track has a pulsating heartbeat sound accompanied by an eerie music track which give the game more atmosphere especially when going into deeper and more challenging dungeons.  The other tracks for the dungeon and town are nice and enhance the game further.  Its the music for main menu that is maybe the weakest as you are more interesting in getting into the game that you bypass it quickly.  Score (7\/10)<br><br>Gameplay<br>The game is turn based however due to the fast response, the smoothness and quickness of the movement\/battles etc it is very easy to be fooled into thinking that it is real-time.  The number times I have moved my hero too quickly only to end up smack bang into a horde of monsters is my fault. This of course ended my turn only for the enemy to start hurls weapons, spells etc at me doing more damage before I could damage them.  One particular battle was the battle with gryphons in which they made a large section of the tiled floor all ice and because of my quickness my hero and NPC were sliding about in opposite directions.  This was both laughable at the start and then frustrating later due to being so eager to fight them that I forgot it was turn based.  So going turn based may make the game feel slower but it cranks up the tension and atmosphere in the dungeons.  Battles required tactical thought when dealing with different monsters at the same time.  Boss battles require even more thought because before you know you it, your surrounded by their minions etc.<br><br>There are lots of weapons in the dungeons and comparing them to your own weapons reveals each of them have their own good and bad traits.  You have to decide which one might be good for you.  With so much choice, I spent about 5 minutes deciding whether to replace the sword I have with a new spear which has some bigger bonus hits but with less abilities.  Gold is in abundance but that is quickly spent on upgrading the armoury and blacksmith in your town to get better stronger weapons and armour.<br><br>Magic is a crucial factor and with 6 schools of magic totalling 18 spells each with levels to go up in make the game more interesting which gives way to deciding which spell you feel it better for you.  You have 8 slots to hold weapons, magic and other items to use in battle etc but which ones to go into which slots.<br>Gameplay (10\/10)<br><br>From what I have seen there are 2 aspects to this game: Story and Gauntlet.<br><br>The Gauntlet:  <br>I first went into this by mistake right as the start with no clue as to how the game work and died very quickly.  I tried again thinking I made a mistake somewhere only to die again.  It was then I discovered the story aspect and realised that the gauntlet is a straight into dungeon rogue game to last as long as possible.  Will try that once I complete the story aspect<br><br>The Story:  <br>This the main part of the game which introduces you to the game mechanics as well as the object of the game.  Build up your hero male\/female with weapons bought or found, fight monsters, gain gold and acquire other items scattered about the dungeon to help you .  There is a town which you have to build to acquire more weapons and allow you access to your magic spells etc.  In your quests in the dungeons you will encounter NPC characters\/creatures who will give aid in battle with their own style of weapons.  As to what the story is about well I will leave that up to you to find as I am finding out now.<br><br>Criticisms:<br>I only have one.  When you hover you arrow mouse over the buildings it would be nice to see the name of the building.  I sometimes select the blacksmith when I want the armoury or select the vault thinking it is the armoury.  but that is the only quibble.<br><br>Bottom Line<br>This is a game is fantastic with its old style look that should appeals to gamers old and young.  It has sharp, colourful animated graphics, with good game play, nice sounds\/music etc and once you learn the game mechanics it is very easy to control.  A big thank you Spellbind Studios for creating a beautiful looking rogue style game.

I've picked up nearly every rogue-like on Steam hoping to find &quot;the one.&quot; I do believe this may be it.<br><br>At first it will come across as simplified but it's actually very deep. Monsters have elemental weaknesses and immunities (Pokemon style). There are some tile modifiers not often seen in rogue-likes such as ice that can cause involuntary movement (slipping).<br><br>There are many quality of life improvements over traditional rogue-likes such as companions, teleportation and being able to see your equipped weapons. There is a story mode that gives you an otherworldly Harry Potter meets Pokemon feel. The Gauntlet mode is where you'll find your traditional rogue-like if you're not interested in the story.<br><br>UPDATE: 24 hours after the game's release the developer released a patch addressing gameplay changes based on feedback from the few negative reviews.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25734819', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25734819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25734819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25734819' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25734819\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25734819', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25734819_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25734819_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26282748\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/petrosant83\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"120893344\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/93\/93ebeb3ae765a0fe3675e39da1f776ad91f2017e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/93\/93ebeb3ae765a0fe3675e39da1f776ad91f2017e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/93\/93ebeb3ae765a0fe3675e39da1f776ad91f2017e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/petrosant83\/\" data-miniprofile=\"120893344\">shakm<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/petrosant83\/games\/?tab=all\">233 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/petrosant83\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/petrosant83\/recommended\/392260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the way indie games should be!<br><br>Easy to learn, addictive and oozing charm and polish. I can't remember the last time i played a game for 10 hours within a day.<br><br>This is for you if:<br>+ You love upgrading stuff and progressing<br>+ You enjoy light strategic thinking, but don't care for complex decision-making<br>+ Good variety for you means adjusting your tactics and weapons to the particular combination of enemies you face<br>+ You value polish and charm more than realistic graphics.<br>+ You don't need more than a very simple charming cliche-ish story, with minimal text to read, non-voiced<br><br>This is NOT for you if:<br>- You like complex civilization-type grand strategy and get annoyed by very light strategy<br>- Good variety for you means an open world or 100 different biomes<br>- You need a well thought complex plot with twists and characters you can identify with<br>- You value in-game music very much (i'm just using spotify instead...)<br><br>The kind of enjoyment i got from this game looks something like this:<br>&gt; &quot;New level reached! Let's see what the next level of spells do then.. Sh!t, i wish i could have all of them...&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Oh cr@p, replicating blobs AND egg-laying birds? Let me take a few seconds to think weapons and positioning...&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Quest done! Now let's go sell my junk to the vendors, upgrade said vendors and see what new shiny weapons and armor they get with each upgrade!&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Hmm should i keep using my 200dmg-health leaching-sword which has reached its level cap, or go for this 190dmg that still has 4 more levels to go? You know what, give me both - i'll slowly level up the new one and use the old one for hairy situations...&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;So i stocked up on health potions, upgraded all vendors and bought the best weapons available (for now) and i still got a ton of money.

I personally don't really care for the story, but if you dig evil wizards doing evil \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 with evil magic, this is the title for you.<br><br>Then it has the actual roguelike game mode, called Gauntlet. You start on a dungeon at level 1, with only a sword and potions, and you keep going through the floors until you die, collecting loot and leveling up as you go. Every X amount of floors there's a boss who is higher level than you character and can screw you if you are bad like me, but drops some good loot when killed.<br><br>The actual mechanincs and balance of the diferent types of weapons and spells seems good from what I've played so far. The combat is a fast paced style of turn-based, where you either attack, move, use a potion, or switch weapon\/spell. But for example, a Lance allows you to move and attack on the same turn, and in some situations (with the right mob placement) kill multiple enemys in one turn; however, it's a two-handed weapon, meaning you can't use a shield with it, like you can with sword or an axe, meaning you can't block attacks. Also, if you play Hearthstone, think of your potions as Reno Jackson - they always heal you to full. You also have the system of when you level up puting points into your stats and into your spells, and a pretty cool system for your gear where every piece will have a rank, wich goes up by using that piece - for example a weapon rank goes up by killing things with it, and every time you go up a rank it rolls a new affix on that weapon, wich can be the damage or another random property (think Diablo 3 loot). So your common drop can actually be better then a rare drop if you have used it more.<br>You get bonus XP if you kill every enemy and open every chest on a floor (it tells you when you do), and you can use the map to teleport to various waypoints spread across the floors (the entrance and exit, when you find it, act as waypoints to). You need keys to open the chests, the keys drop from enemys, so if you find a chest and don't have a key, you can always go to it later easily. And from my experience, you always get enough keys for all the chests.<br><br>All in all, it's a fun time killer, with some good ideas from games you problably played before, and an interesting art style. My only gripe so far is that the tiles out your character's vision just disapear and pop in when you move constantly, and since you move relatively fast out of combat it can be a bit anoying, but I eventually got used to navigating that way.<br><br>EDIT: After recent updates, most of my issues have been solved.

The story isn't particularly complex, but it scratches the ocassional itch I have for a Diablo style, hit the monster until candy fall out, type of relaxation. The story is novel enough to keep me motivated, the monsters come in bizzare combinations of varieties, and you can't predict what you'll be fighting in advance in most of the procedural generated dungeons, so there is a fair bit of learning what they can do, and applying strategy on the fly. Its perfect ofr its pricepoint, and does exactly what I wanted it to do.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26921565', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26921565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26921565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26921565' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26921565\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26921565', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26921565_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26921565_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25789905\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197997899034\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"37633306\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c0e40617c3c183a53e28f475474c509e561833.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c0e40617c3c183a53e28f475474c509e561833.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/95\/95c0e40617c3c183a53e28f475474c509e561833_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197997899034\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37633306\">Sandsifter<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197997899034\/games\/?tab=all\">357 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197997899034\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197997899034\/recommended\/392260\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like this game, I really do. I have 300+ games installed, and this is only my second review on steam; Hands of Fate was my first. Hands of Fate because I thought the design was really unique; Rogue Wizards, because one mechanic was stopping me from enjoying a really good indie game.<br><br>It's a great time filler. Not as complex as some other rogue-likes, which is not a bad thing.  Dungeons of Dredmor is probably my favorite in the genre, and the fact that I'm comparing them favorably says a lot. That said, here is the one thing that is almost stopping me from continuing to play it further:<br><br>The damn tiles popping in and out. It's annoying as hell, makes me dizzy after a while, and serves absolutely no purpose.<br><br>I'm not sure if the point of it is to minimize memory use by not keeping everything on the screen; other than that, I can't imagine why that would be part of the design. Granted, it's cool when you first see it. I thought it was cool in Bastion. But Jeez, lock the tiles once they have been discovered. Put in a &quot;fog of war&quot; if you want, but don't keep things popping up and down through the entire game. It's almost a game-breaker for me.<br><br>One other small complaint. When I'm hallucinating, and I've killed all the bad guys, don't make me hit the space bar 45 times until the effect wear off; it serves no purpose.<br><br>Otherwise, nice game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25789905', 'summary' );

The game is hugely addictive, very playable and fun.  It's simple and intuitive and clearly designed for its eventual iOS release, however, it's still a delight to play on PC.  I think this will be a huge hit when it is released for tablets, and potentially larger form-factor phones.<br><br>The developers are responsive and clearly listen to the community, and it pays dividends.  I was never a huge fan of the way blocks became 'visible', but in the latest update theyv'e changed even that core visual.<br><br>It's very much child friendly, and is an ideal intro to the genre for younger gamers, but don't let that put you off, this game delivers at all ages.  At times its deceptively simple but you can quickly find yourself out of your depth.  Thnankfully, the turn based mechanic allows time to think, or to respond to IRL distractions, whilst somehow managing to be unintrusive.

New game in sight! All hands on deck! This time we are going to tackle \u201cRogue Wizards\u201d by Spellbind Studios. A Game about Dungeons, Wizards and Magic! Oh, and of course loot! And skills. And Monsters. And Dungeons. Did I mention loot?! The loot can gain ranks and random enchantments too! Do I need to say more? Yes!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">First look at the game: <\/div><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/captn3mo\/v\/104662918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >also available as VOD on twitch<\/a><br>Rogue Wizards is a game that instantly caught me in its net of nice features, good looks, challenge level, awesome soundtrack and similarity to some of my favorite games:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I don\u00b4t like to compare modern games to Rogue (1980) anymore, but as a genre defining prototype for a legion of games\u2026lets us say we can still see similarities or general ideas from rogue in newer games. As is the case with Rogue Wizards. In a good way! <br><\/li><li>Your task is to venture through multiple dungeons of varying difficulty. Whether you do this in Story mode, being presented with a neat little tale about\u2026well Rogue Wizards or in the Gauntlet mode (incl. Permadeath\/QuitSaveonly) is entirely your choice.<br><\/li><li>The following is true for both game modes: randomly generated Dungeons, variety in items, variety in enemies and difficulty possible, customizable Character (18 Spells and 3 Attributes), Armor, Jewelry, Ranged and Melee Items that rank up and gain random enchantments (Trillions of possibilities \u2013 For me the point at which the games has me in its grips) and of course turn based movement.<br><\/li><li>Spellcasting uses components that drop as loot. You can also craft different potions with them. More choices! Yehaww. There are Experience and Shield Potions as far as I know right now.<br><\/li><li>The game has been under constant improvement since its launch! So there is an active Developer behind this who really cares. That is worth a lot! <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Update<\/div><\/li><li> Since i have been playing this game for a while now, i have to add: The random generation of enemie combinations and item enchantments make this game very! very! hard in gauntlet mode. I still have to get past level 23. It may be a bit too random. But then again, i may not be approaching this the right way and make to many mistakes because i am a silly person. I just wanted to add that observation to my review.(Date added: 09.01.2017)<\/li><\/ul><div class=\"bb_h1\">Look and feel and sound: <\/div>Rogue Wizards looks perfect for a game like this. It has a nice comic art style and a well chosen color palette (of course very much subjective here). The music is very fitting and does never annoy or distract. The fighting and monster sounds feel responsive and full. They do create a nice battle atmosphere. The spells look gorgeous and so do some of the triggered effects on various equipment pieces. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Captains Orders:<\/div>I love that game! It is the, albeit easier on the difficulty, cute looking sibling of Dungeons of Dredmor maybe. Or even related to that old Nethack! Or Rogue? Maybe that is where the name came from? For me, it is a perfect game for a relaxed gaming session that does not run for 4 hours but can be half an hour to an hour per chunk you bite of (namely per dungeon or per dungeon level). It can also be a very nerve wrecking Permadeath challenge! Just as a warning (or advertisement if you are so inclined)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict: <\/div><b>Treasure!<\/b>  A quick to start tactical game with enough depth to keep you going for hours but with missions designed for intense battles and a Permadeath gameplay mode that feels like playing Chess at a certain point.  The Item Ranking system makes this game a real keeper in my book!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">For more Reviews visit  <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/captainnemoweb.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >CaptNemo's Log<\/a><\/div><div class=\"bb_h1\">For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/captn3mo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >CaptN3mo's twitch channel<\/a><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28265266', 'recent_short' );

It's good for burning 30 minutes to an hour on at a time - but it lacks a certain &quot;hook&quot; that other games have.  Otherwise, it's something great to play when no internet is available!  Before going into the full review, i'm going to drop a plug in case you're interested:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL_8AuschIyY3zvEOAx90ieQN7tUnxpAKI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Rogue Wizards Let's Play on YouTube!<\/a><br><br>This game advertises procedural generation on all maps and items, which I completely believe.  There were certain limits that you could tell the game was bumping up to but that's fine: that's how you balance the game.<br><br>The animations are simple, cute, and entertaining.  It's something I could put my kid in front of and not worry about them ever having nightmares or asking me about something lude.  It's all pretty G rated!<br><br>Combat is very straight forward, and the controls are simple.  They fall in line with most other games and are very conventional.  All in all, I had a positive experience with nearly everything in the game!  Nearly....<br><br>With that out of the way, I'll start covering some of the more negative stuff.  I got very tired of inventory management very quickly.  As someone who doesn't like to sit and min\/max, I got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of statistics that could possibly be on each item, and how they would impact my character.  It seems like in the long run it's fairly irrelevant as long as you're updating your gear as you go.<br><br>I also didn't like the fact that most of the spells seemed useless?  If you pick just a couple of spells and put all of your points into them, you'll do devastating amounts of damage, as long as the mobs aren't resistant to that spell line.<br><br>Finally, the storyline is pretty much non-existent.  They put words on the screen, but they're irrelevant really.<br><br>All in all, I enjoyed the game for what I've put into it and would have gladly paid full price for it!  SpellBind studios made a pretty good indie game, and a few of my friends have picked it up after seeing the Let's Play.

Depending on which mode you choose, the Rogue standard of Perma-death is present, where if you fall in combat once, it's start over from go. There is turn based combat on a grid and a small amount of tactical decisions to be made based off elemental magic. Despite all of those features I wanna be up front and honest, the game to me feels more like a Roguelite-lite. I know that sounds silly and makes no sense but it would if you played the game. It hits most marks to be considered a Roguelike but I found there to be something missing. I enjoyed the game don't get me wrong, I beat it even which is something I wouldn't do if I didn't enjoy it. Despite that either due to difficulty or perhaps design choices, Rogue Wizards is missing a certain je ne sais quoi.<br><br>Moving on to the aforementioned games modes. The first is story mode where you have a decent little narrative about a suppressed people being told they could never use magic, suddenly discovering in fact they can and that the powers that be, are corrupt. The second is a Gauntlet mode where you don't have any of the story bits and its just pure dungeon-go-go. Each has a hard mode to unlock once beaten that features Perma-death. The difference between the two modes is minimal, so much so that I would say if you have zero interest in the story, then Gauntlet felt like a hollow experience. I preferred the story mode as it gives you a break between the dungeons and lets you sort yourself out far as loot and upgrading the city of Antarit.<br><br>Antarit is where the story progresses, and you begin to collect your army to fight the evil wizards. Additionally you begin to unlock buildings in Antarit that allow you to purchase supplies, armor, weapons, enchantments, pets and other nifty things. Its very crucial because, without that break, non-stop dungeoning might of driven me mad. Certain stores\/locations in Antarit can be upgraded by collecting gold from your sold loot or fallen foes. The UI\/Interactions are just like the rest of the game its all based off your mouse. Nothing too complicated. Take out Antarit and you've got Gauntlet mode, that's basically it.<br><br>So you make your little wizard, name him, no customization sadly, and then you're off!<br><br>You kill stuff, collect shiny loot and level. When you level, you upgrade three stats of your choosing. I mention this solely based off the fact its just there, because this was never a factor at any point in my playthrough. I just kept all my stats around the same number and I was fine. Aside from stats you can upgrade your spell tree which consists of six elements, life, cosmic, fire, ice, earth, lightning. Each has an opposing and damaging element to each other. This never affects you the player but it mostly effects the monsters you face. Each spell element has three spells attached to it in your spellbook.<br><br>There are six equipment slots not including weapon slots. Equipment can range from common all the way to Epic with varying degrees of enchantment and abilities. The UI is fairly simple and minimalistic, the reason being, the game is also ported to the mobile market. So while neatly designed, you can clearly see where the mobile factor kicks in.<br><br>Getting into the nitty gritty of things you are tasked with bringing balance to the elements by unlocking their perspective realms. You do this by leveling up in randomly generated dungeons. Obviously Rogue Wizards is a game that has high replay ability and little shout outs are thrown in there like, &quot;The Darkest-est Dungeon&quot; It's things like this that do give the game charm. I would've loved more of these little Easter eggs in between randomized dungeons.<br><br>Upon reaching a certain level, an elemental plane is unlocked and you go fight an evil wizard, get some story bits\/loot and repeat until the end of the game. This formula is sadly never deviated from all the way to the end of the game. The final battle is a bit more epic but essentially plays out like all the other wizard battles.<br><br>The art style is one that I personally found enjoyable but it does have issues. Despite the cute characters, pets, and spell animations all looking fantastic. the dungeons themselves are going to be a hit and miss. Dungeons have either an illustrated background or are just pure black. Floors rise in or drop out while your characters view distance shifts. The view distance being the primary problem as your character can see up to about five blocks away, which isn't very far. This can become disorienting and even strange looking sometimes as you move about dungeons quickly. Enemy variants are a bit lacking as well. After about the first four to six dungeons you probably have seen most enemy types. No palette swapping and bosses are just giant versions of their normal counter parts.<br><br>Combat is by far the most appealing aspect in the game to me. It's actually quite fun to wade into a group of enemies and use a bunch of different weapons to slaughter them all. Chakrams are very OP and Axes can win the game for you. Combat is turned based and most monsters have a myriad of different strategies and abilities so that battles don't become dull.<br><br>Sadly, things do become easy, too easy. Bosses are laughable in most cases and I only died if I wasn't paying attention to my health bar. Which would happen on occasion, because I forgot I had health. Movement in combat itself can be brutally slow as you and the enemy move in one space, one turn, sometimes you are granted more depending on enchantments and which enemy you face.  Keep in mind this is purely difficulty based on story mode and not hard mode which could be different. It is still worth mentioning, as it took me sixteen hours to unlock hard mode.<br><br>One gripe I do have is the way in which you equip weaponry. You have a quick bar on the bottom of your screen that works as a place to put weapons, spells, and potions. The eight slots are more then enough for you to have whatever you need but the problem lies in the way spells are used in the game. Most attack spells are treated like weapons instead of spells. This wouldn't be a problem if switching weapons in combat didn't cost you a whole round. It felt very counter intuitive going from my Axe\/Shield combo to glowing red fireball fist\/shield. There are spells that activate instantly without the need to switch. This lead me to just use those spells predominantly and only use attack spells on elemental bosses. This silliness is also heightened by the fact spells cost reagents and have a limited number of use as you are only allowed to carry a hundred of each reagent. It just felt like using magic was more punishing and very situation based, instead of being cool and fun to use.<br><br>It should be noted that while I do have some gripes with the game it mostly comes from a place of love. I had a great time playing this game, I just wished there were less kinks in the armor.<br><br>Speaking of armor, armor enchantments are random to the point of being silly. When you hit level fifty and find an epic ring, you expect it to have far better enchantments than a ring you found at level ten right? That isn't the case here, as enchantments seemingly don't scale with your level. The example I gave was a real thing, I had a ring with plus ten for two of the stats and seven for the last. I never found anything better even when I found higher quality rings. This occurred several times for all the equipment pieces during my time with the game.<br><br>The game does however scale with your level. Monsters are always your exact level so the challenge never changes. The only time it does, is when you meet &quot;Strong&quot; version of monsters that have more health and hit harder. Another rare exception to this is when you run into an Elite that is almost like a boss but not quite.
