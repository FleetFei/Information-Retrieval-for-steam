I'm so glad I spent the money!  The story is great, with just a touch of humor (Uncle Benjo's moves when he wins a fight), but not so much as to have a high cheese factor.  The story is also intriguing.  I'd say the graphics are a VHS quality, so not high end but definitely not pixelated.  It's just the style.  The colors and various areas you go into are VERY attractive.  Gameplay is straightforward, which I Like, and the tutorial is very helpful without being tedious.  If anyone knows how we can search for other games by the same publishers, can you let me know? There is this and a few others that I'd like to &quot;follow&quot; (on Amazon you can &quot;follow&quot; authors and Amazon will notify me of new releases).  The Steam recommended for me feature is usually pretty INACCURATE.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30851481', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30851481' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30851481\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30851481' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30851481\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30851481', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30851481_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30851481_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30802034\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elwisia\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"70985235\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/40\/40c7b0ca15607d0112d76d6539f00c01664323cf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/40\/40c7b0ca15607d0112d76d6539f00c01664323cf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/40\/40c7b0ca15607d0112d76d6539f00c01664323cf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elwisia\/\" data-miniprofile=\"70985235\">Narcoleptic Marshmallow<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elwisia\/games\/?tab=all\">291 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elwisia\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elwisia\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">27.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a pleasant surprise this game was. I will admit, several red flags were raised prior to me buying this game. The $30 price tag, mixed reviews, Kickstarter, Unity Engine... But on the promise that it would take me back to old JRPGs I played as a kid, I decided to give Earthlock: Festival of Magic a chance. And I'm glad I did.<br><br>Before the review proper I want to thank Snowcastle Games for putting so much effort into something that could easily have been one of many failed Kickstarter projects. I truly hope the small downsides and problems this game have will be fixed in the upcoming sequels. You guys said there was going to be a trilogy and I hope you stick to it.<br><br>Now, for my somewhat lengthy review:<br><br>The game is wonderfully crafted. You can tell a lot of effort went into the scenarios and the soundtrack. The art itself may not be for everyone, but it's hard to deny they knew what they were doing when they decided for it. The game, as stated, plays as an oldschool JRPG, so a few modern day luxuries, such as quick saving \/ save anywhere, are absent. But thankfully we don't have to deal with random encounters.<br><br>Combat is surprisingly challenging, truly a remnant from bygone eras. I don't remember the exact line spoken by a game character, but it was something like &quot;a hammer and a key can be used to open a lock; both work, but one makes it significantly easier&quot;, and this is what the game promotes. You are given many customisation options and it's up to you to decide which one to use for each boss. Expect a few game overs every now and then. The little tune that plays in the game over screen is also lovely, you almost forget this is your 4th failed attempt on the same boss.<br><br>The story, which is what I value the most in a game like this, is a bit lacking. If you're a hardcore RPG fan like me, there is nothing you haven't seen elsewhere. You have the main character with a hidden past, a strong independent female co-lead who is not very good at being strong or independent, a few mascots, and a bad guy trying to take over the world. It's all here. The characters' backgrounds are mostly left unanswered.<br><br>At the time of this review, there was a comic book DLC telling the story of two of them, which is not something I agree with, but it's something, I guess. It says comic book #1, so I assume there are more coming, which will rack up the final price considerably, for something that should have been in the game from the start.<br><br>The game is also very short, with very little side stuff to do, and zero replay value. Took me 20 hours to clear the game with 100% achievements. And that's counting all the game overs. For $30 it might not sound like such a good deal, and this, along with the cliche story and DLC character stories, made me want to give a negative review, but I'd still reccomend it if you get it in a sale, or as a gift.

The game has numerous flaws, but if you temper your expectations you'll be taken on a rather enjoyable journey.<br><br>I'll begin with the game's strengths. The music is absolutely brilliant. Almost every track fit right in and strengthened the atmosphere of the entire game. The dynamic music, how the overworld track would go right into the combat version of a song then seamlessly right back out once combat ended, was a great touch.<br><br>The story is simple. This is actually a boon to the game as it keeps the focus where it needs to be. The characters all have their reason for going on the journey, and it's never hard to follow.<br><br>The world is pleasant to look at. Visual design for most places ranges from 7\/10 to 10\/10. I do not know if it was intended, but the stark contrast in appearance between the ancient technology and the modern, rediscovered\/reinvented technology was pleasing. The world felt as fresh and unique as it needed to be. In addition there are lots of little bits of lore scattered around for those who wish to look. Even the character Gnart, a scribe of sorts, keeps a little journal of the adventure one can read at any time. You can tell they cared enough to flesh out their world beyond what the story required.<br><br>There are many great systems similar to those used in other rpgs. There are no random encounters, all enemies being visible on all maps. One can choose to engage a large group or lure them off one at a time. There are benefits to both approaches. Obviously fighting fewer enemies at a time will make life easier, but fighting more builds a large experience multiplier skyrocketing levels much faster. It's a great risk vs reward system. Although the difficulty spikes make it near manditory to fight large groups when you can or else you may have to go back to grind levels later.<br><br>You have a party of 4 out of possible 6 characters. Each character can be 'paired' to any other and they work together. They gain passive bonuses based on their bond level, which can change up how they play. Furthermore every character has two seperate stance which give them multiple different abilities. You can have the character Amon play as a rogue\/thief, or as a ranged heavy hitter.<br><br>Instead of physical equipment, each character has a large talent board. On the talent board you can put stat cards, ability cards, and perk cards. This further changes the way characters can play, though each one is locked into a general role. The mages are never going to be as effective fighters as the characters made for it, but they can be made somewhat passable if one chooses.<br><br>The use of teleport and saving statues is nice. They're well placed so one is never far from being able to save or teleport back to a town, so the lack of being able to save anywhere was not noticed at all.<br><br>The gardening is a cute addition. I mean that both literal and sarcastically. It's not required except to craft healing potions, or if you plan on turning either of the two character with ranged weaponry into ranged specialists. It is the only reliable way to gain potions or ammunition, and can be quite time consuming. Perhaps being able to purchase second best ammunition and potions from shops would alleviate the frustration I had with the game design behind it. Using it to craft the best items would give incentive, while giving the second best items to shops would have made it 100% skippable by those not wanting to touch it. <br><br>The enemy visual design is a little hit and miss. In general I like it, even though there's not a wide variety of enemies so some models are simple retextures. I adored the old enemies from the ancient ruins.<br><br><br>Now the bad. Like I said the flaws are numerous but most are relatively minor, considering the small team and inexperience behind the people involved. Some minor spoilers about characters lie below, but nothing pertinent to the story.<br><br>The scope felt a little bit too big for the story. There wasn't a whole lot of character interaction, and I could feel any footing of investment I had in a few of the characters slip as time went on. Gnart and Amon end up being the most interesting of all the characters. That's not to say the others couldn't potentially be, but there is so little ever mentioned of them that it's easy to forget that they are more than cardboard cutouts holding weapons. Olia, a mysterious spear wielding warrior\/scholar, obviously has an interesting backstory that is constantly hinted at, but never properly told. Taika is an odd and special breed of magic dog, but we're never told what makes them special. PAT is an ancient robot from the pre-magic-apocalypse, but he tells almost nothing of interest before that pre-magic-apocalypse. I think Ive is my least favorite character, but that may be because of her introduction to the game and lack of consequences for a particular action she commits rather than her demeanor. The game shares a lot of backstory on Amon and Gnart, on the other hand. While it serves to flesh them out a lot and is wonderful in and of itself. It also highlights just how little the game tells us of the others. In short, I think the characters have character, but the lack of interaction makes one easily forget.<br><br>The dialogue is also rather simple and a little strange at times. Some of it could be due to translation, but it never bothered me personally.<br><br>In addition I wish there was just more interaction between all the characters. They all had their various reasons for being dragged into this adventure, but the party banter felt very lacking. Maybe an easy solution to this could have been various interactions on the Isle of Plumpet (your home base more or less) depending on how far into the story you are. Interactions with things leading the chosen leader of your party to comment with their thoughts or feelings. <br><br>The fights, or rather the game difficulty, seemed very spotty. You're driven in a linear fashion through the world, or else this wouldn't be much of an issue. However more than a few times you'll enter an area or find a new boss, and there is no way forward except to go back and grind out a level or two. Maybe it was because sometimes I preferred to not fight large groups of enemies so I became underleveled, but even so it was an annoyance. In addition, the AI seems really bad. For example, it will bring a character to the brink of death and then focus on another before actually finishing said character. <br><br>Animations are a little clunky and character models felt stiff. In contract to the music work, the sound design for everything else was mediocre. <br><br><br>This is very spoilerific for the ending, so reader be warned. I'm wondering how the party managed to escape the memory of Maato after destroing the Valvur'ed Ichabo. To my knowledge there was no proper way to leave once you entered. Them just magically pooping out after winning the fight seemed very hamfisted. I can forgive everything else in the game, but that was one thing I felt really needed an explanation. Perhaps this is due to the general feeling of the scope of the game being slightly larger than what the devs could feasably pull off, which I feel is the reason for a lot of other story\/character interaction related things. But still, this if anything needed some sort of explanation.<br><br><br>In short, the story is nothing spectacular but passable and unpretentious. The game systems are hit and miss, but with a lot of novel things thrown in. The world and music are delightful. I paid around 27 euros for this game. I'd say it's at best a  15 euro title, for those that like this sort of game. Although I feel no regrets paying the amount I did and am glad the money went to this studio. There was real talent and real love fueling this game. Despite the pockmarks and cracks, I found it to be a great experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26753409', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26753409' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26753409\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26753409' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26753409\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26753409', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26753409_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26753409_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28166803\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"67485341\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f290b51004cb9e4f6416abb77a4cc52ef74839a7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f290b51004cb9e4f6416abb77a4cc52ef74839a7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f2\/f290b51004cb9e4f6416abb77a4cc52ef74839a7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67485341\">csect<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/games\/?tab=all\">82 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/csect\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNice, old school JRPG that harkens to the some of my favorites like the older Final Fantasies and Dragon Quest.  It does the fundamentals well without trying to do anything too radical or new, just a few twists on the tried and true formula, some of which are brilliantly simple and I think add a lot to the experience.  <br>It is apparent that the whole thing was made with love. The world and soundtrack are beautiful and have a lot of character, but the storytelling is pretty lazy, the characters are a little flat, and a lot of it just feels kind of slapped together.<br>Still, all-told, I'm having a good time exploring their world and beating up cartoon monsters with my rag-tag crew of good guys, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  If you want a laid back jrpg romp, this is a good one.  <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a

like this likes kinda cool, so I read up on it before it came out,liked what I read and the pictures of the game too.I checked back on the game's forums every few days to find out about updates and what people were talking about.Then it was delayed for about 3 weeks give or take, at this point I was skeptical and to be honest a little upset I wasn't playing it yet.<br>When it did come out I checked reviews which were mixed and saw the thirty dollar price tag, well that being the case I put it on my wishlist for a sale, fast forward maybe 6 weeks and I find it on Humble Bundle for under twenty with better reviews on Steam.<br><br>I picked it up and glad I did because it is a hidden gem of a game, in part also because my friend Saibot wrote a good review and I respect his opinion since we like similiar game\/genre.<br><br>Pros: Combat is easy to understand but harder to master and includes building up each toon differently but working as a  <br>        unit.<br>        Graphics are really nice and fit the game perfectly - Fredrik Dahl - Concept Artist,  great job Sir!<br>        Soundtrack and game sounds are well done and again fit the game.<br>        Story is not super detailed but solid and interesting.<br>        Characters pull you in and are relatable.<br>Cons:The text is not perfect, but easy to understand, remember they are a small studio from Oslo, Norway, English isn't <br>          thier first language.<br>           Price is a little high but they do have to make a living - at twenty they would have sold more copies off the bat.<br>          All in all a really good RPG here from a small studio who is passionate about the game  and put their hearts into<br>          it.<br>          Twenty to Thirty plus hours to complete depending if you are speed racer or just cruisin.<br>           Well Done Snowcastle Games<br>       <br>        <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

classic jRPG formula and should be instantly familiar to anyone who enjoys that kind of game. Besides its own charming cast of characters and beautiful world, it has a number of mechanics that set it appart from the rest:<br><br>Character progression: <br>Characters level up, but unlock skills and talents on a talent board - different talents are collected or crafted, then sloted on the board as the player earns more slots. To use a slot, a character has to have an available point to spend, a talent to place in it, and must have a talent in one of the adjacent slots. There are different types of slots - some reserved for the character's abilities, some for stat boosts, others for passive abilities such as damage reduction, extra damage or the ability to ressurect once per fight.<br><br>Stances:<br>In combat each character has two stances tehy can switch between. Thus Amon, the main hero, can either be a dagger wielding rogue, able to cloack himself, mug and steal from opponents and slice and dice them, or he can grab his trusty gun and shoot opponents with ammo harvested from his garden (yes, you grow your own ammunition in a garden). <br><br>Bond:<br>In your party of up to 4 characters, you can pair up sets of characters and their bond will increase, giving them unique boosts whenever these specific two are paired up. It adds another layer to party selection, as you will not only look at what four characters to take along, but also how better to split them into two pairs to gain the bonuses you need in a given situation.<br>On top of that, each pair shares the typical &quot;limit break&quot; style bar used to power specials. So once you can trigger a special, you still have to choose which of the two characters' ability will be more useful.<br><br>Overall, it is a fun, beautiful little game. It is not the longest, it is not the most challenging, but if you give it a chance, it can offer you fun with some nifty character systems, enjoyable gameplay and some tough boss fights.<br><br>Backed it on kickstarter and did not regret doing so :)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28236181', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28236181' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28236181\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28236181' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28236181\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28236181', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28236181_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28236181_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26290437\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"155834747\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/98a5d249b5eecbfacfe2163b076fd942d9f6e670.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/98a5d249b5eecbfacfe2163b076fd942d9f6e670.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/98a5d249b5eecbfacfe2163b076fd942d9f6e670_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/\" data-miniprofile=\"155834747\">Saibot<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/games\/?tab=all\">1,121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/recommended\/\">126 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/S41B0T\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">21.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> This game doesn't deserve the current rating of 72% <\/div><br>Simply a beautiful (J)RPG which will give you hours of throwback goodness.

I want to remain as spoiler free as possible so I won't comment on the story so far but i can promise you <div class=\"bb_h1\"> for a Indie game its really impressive! <\/div> The signs so far are strong, especially for it being a 27,99\u20ac Game. I got it discounted on Halloween Sale for 22,39\u20ac and i dont regret it!<br><br>Walking around the world is a little under whelming in terms of &quot;stuff to do&quot;, but it's charming. Grinding enemies can be a bit of that, a grind, but there's workarounds and special things to do to make sure you're not spending to much time collecting a big mob of dudes to kill. <br><br>Good story, good artwork, great soundtrack, and the turn-based mechanics are pulled of very well. Something about it reminds me of my childhood, and it shows that you don't need a big budget to make a good game.<br><br>That being said... omg... The Soundtrack. Oh god please who is the God who made that Soundtrack? It gave me goosebumps. I mean..

While the titles this game is based on are great, they require those who weren't fans or unable to get past certain pet peeves to put up with it for the entire game.<br><br>Things like repetitive battle music, slow battles, oversimplified commands (generic Attack command), and the dreaded grinding of fighting the same short encounter list makes classics and modern retro RPGs harder to enjoy for many people. Earthlock addresses all of this while forging it's own identity.<br><br>The Soundtrack is incredible and diverse, but what makes it more than just nice to listen is that battle themes are rearranged versions of the area themes they belong. It truly makes the game more enjoyable when your favorite battle themes can be traced to fighting in the sewer or on the glacier. But most importantly you never go into the hundreds upon hundreds of battles hearing the same opening over and over, also the switch is seamless as a nice touch.<br><br>Slow battles is a little harder to explain, but just expect no ATB bars and being able to input commands much faster than most turn based games. In the few instances where the battles drag on a bit, the game shells you a bit of bonus EXP for sticking to the end.<br><br>Very early the game teaches you a simple trick, slashing attacks kill plant enemies better. From this point on, you realize that the generic attack technically dosen't exist in this game, the game puts it in your best interest to explore and adapt since the stances can radically change your battle strategies and with more useful attack abilites (Gouge, traps) and becuase such logic as only ranged attacks can hit flying enemies, stops the players from mashing an attack command for 40 hours.<br><br>Last but not least, Grinding. There are too many good games classic and modern that need warning labels about how much they block your progression or enjoyment because of this curse. It seems way too hyperbolic to state that Earthlock simply has no grinding, it techinically does, but with good mechanical and subtle design it never needs to plauge the average player. Encounters are visible and can be avoided or engaged quite easily, but another feature is to lure encounters into 1 large outnumbering battle. When you risk these battles, your exp is dramaticly increased based on the size of the encounters, in fact fighting single enemies produces pitiful gains. In this fashion, the game encourages you to seek battles that might be more than you can chew. You never find yourself fighting the same list of encounters with a static exp increase. A more subtle feature is how the hub garden let's you literally farm for ammo and craft potions, but it's used when players are spending downtime between the more active chunks of the game. Other small things help like getting extra exp for not having anyone die, or making the level cap 20, or how upgrading the bonds gives you points to level up with. The amount of options and characters and pairs, while not staggeringly large, give players lots of room to deal and adapt to bosses and tough areas all the better.<br><br>In terms of cons this game does have a handful or so. The engine and the collsion can be a little spotty when walking around, the control scheme takes a bit to get used to for using abilities and items, PAT takes a small while before he truly holds up as good as the other characters. A less nitpicking issue is that gold (or as this game labels it Daler) has very very little use in this game thanks to how the garden and crafting system works, or how items worth having are found in chests and at the end of boss battles. The game has some good consumable (non health restoring) items to use, but you never get them outside of the arena, and you cant take them elsewhere, so things that could be bought with currency just dont get to be used for some reason. In the end your Daler becomes obselete really fast, I felt that removing the Daler or making more shops would have integrated Daler perfectly.<br><br>There's more subjective things to talk about like how the story and characters are begging to have more time in the spotlight at times, or how the game simply dosen't offer optional areas and even a fraction of side content that more popular games offer, But I state that for a kickstarted retro style RPG this is one the most polished and refined original titles to come out of 2016 and for a first time title from a new indie studio in Norway, That is incredible.<br><br>I (Regrettably) did not kickstart this game and had only found a couple of reviews prior to buying and finishing this game, Therefore most of what I knew going in was minimal at best.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28996091', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28996091' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28996091\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28996091' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28996091\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28996091', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28996091_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28996091_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30288115\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/anubiandragon\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"130341332\">anubiandragon<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 24.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'll admit it: I came for the piggy.  His name's Gnart, by the way, and apparently he's a hogBUNNY.  I don't really see the bunny part, but I guess they were using that to justify the white fur.<br><br>I'm glad I stuck around, though.  This game is worth it.  It's a real nostalgia trip to early 3D roleplaying games, but done effectively with nostalgia goggles.  It looks the way I REMEMBER games from that era; other developers looking to capture that feeling would do well to take a page from this game, using sleek modern lines with classical intent.  SnowCastle figured out which buttons to push and they delivered, over and over throughout this game.<br><br><br>The Good:<br>The music's fairly good for an indie game; it starts to drone on after a while but it has a lietmotif that is memorable and the transitions are well done.  The scenery is breathtaking and believable from a geological perspective (desert surrounded by mountains, forest in the lowlands, swamp at a river delta).  As an audiovisual experience it hits its mark.<br><br>The world-building... wow.  While it's a little back-loaded, the creators went out of their way to make the setting robust.  In particular, the game sets about establishing its own idioms and jargon.  A little vocab for your convenience: Lys is the sun, a Cycle is one orbit around Lys, and a Moonrun is equivalent to one day (not a month, as I originally thought).  The concept of Earthlock\u2019s planet Umbra is a heart of fantasy gold: the planet has stopped rotating and one half of it is in perpetual day, while the other is in perpetual night.  They track the passage of time by the movement of the moon (which is implied to circle the planet once a day by our standards).  The game puts a lot of lore in the fire and not all of it comes to fruition\u2026 that\u2019s good if it\u2019s the start of a series and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s the case.<br><br>Each character has their own flavor\u2026 you\u2019re not likely to care for all of them but you will probably like at least one of them.  The game has context-sensitive cutscenes which trigger based on who is leading the party.  As such, you can switch in somebody you like to be your map icon and they\u2019ll get more screentime.  I didn\u2019t care much for the protagonist (Amon) so I had Gnart running around the entire game (Yes, I like piggies).  I thought this was a very novel approach to player preferences and I\u2019d like to see it used in more JRPGs.<br><br>Combat is excellent: each character has two \u201cstances\u201d which boast a separate set of abilities, doubling the utility of each team member and allowing them to fill two roles.  The aesthetic is sleek and easy to follow; icons on health bars let you know how long an effect will remain and give you the gist of its purpose.  You also have the freedom to customize your character\u2019s stat priorities, so you can create interesting synergy with unusual strategies.  I loaded Gnart with speed-boosting talents and put him into Focus stance: he became a lightning bolt of buffs and whenever somebody else got a turn they hit like a mountain.  There are ways to make any team of four viable which is nice to see; often games with more than three characters will just write some off as throwaways.<br>I have two issues with the combat system I\u2019ll discuss later, but for the most part it was perfect.<br><br>Random encounters aren\u2019t random (a great move in modern RPGs): you can see opponents on the map and each represents one enemy.  One of the most entertaining components of the game is kiting them around so that more than one enters battle at the same time (which gives a bonus multiplier to experience).<br><br><br>Stuff that could use Work:<br>Stances are the big allure of the combat system, which makes it a pity that switching them in combat is so punishing.  Not only do you lose a turn switching stances, but your haste takes a hit and it takes longer to get your next turn.  This is incredibly frustrating and prevents you from switching stances more than a few times the entire game.  To the developers: I\u2019d make normal stance switching accelerated (like the Quick Switch talent) and upgrade Quick Switch to make stance swapping instantaneous.<br>Stances are also particularly punishing for Olia and Gnart: Olia loses her counterattack immediately on switching stance (rather than holding out until her next turn, like it should) and all of Gnart\u2019s buffs fall off the party immediately when he switches stance (something no other buffing character has to deal with).  To the developers: make Olia\u2019s counterattack a one-turn duration refreshing effect and stop removing Gnart\u2019s buffs when he switches to Mage\u2014they\u2019ve already got a timer on them, that\u2019s enough of a power balance.<br><br><br>Stuff I\u2019d pass on next time:<br>PAT.  I know it\u2019s a trope of the genre being evoked, but the quirky robot speaking in blips annoyed me.  Personal preference I guess; the bot was viable as a combat option but in dialogue I rolled my eyes every time it talked.<br><br><br>Overall the game was very satisfying and difficult to put down.  I\u2019d buy a sequel in a heartbeat\u2026 if it had Gnart in it, that is.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30288115', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30288115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30288115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30288115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30288115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30288115', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30288115_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30288115_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30194001\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/moonfac3\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"114460356\">Moonface<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI haven't experienced any problems so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying the game.

So, as many people I started playing with good memories of the FF games.<br><br>I have played many similar games, but so far, this is actually the first one that managed to capture the mood and greatness of a past era. I wasn't blown away at first, but given time, I grew attached to the game's atmosphere, its characters, music and its combat system. It actually managed to do something that Final Fantasy VII never could: having likeable characters, of which you can't decide which ones you take into your party, since you don't want to leave any out.<br><br>I feel like many play about 4-5 hours and give their review, which results in the reviews not doing the game the justice it deserves. But I'm now almost 40 hours into the game and I'm really enjoying it. It has clean, well-polished graphics, a bug-free system and a very interesting background story. I spend about twenty minutes reading through all the shelves in the Owltide Library, which give an insight into how the civilizations and races found in the game came to be. I especially liked the detailed little side-stories, where someone accidentally finds something important, but ends up short of funds, looks for a sponsor, but after some struggle ultimately makes an impact onto the world (Not going into detail to avoid spoilers). All those credible stories and character's interactions imbue the game's world with life and allow you to immerse into it and enjoy the time you spend there.<br><br>I can really recommend to support this game's developers by purchasing it and sincerely hope that they will continue creating such games, ignoring all those nasty ratings of people too narrow-minded to appreciate something great even if it stands right before them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30150286', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30150286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30150286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30150286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30150286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30150286', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30150286_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30150286_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30115458\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/glennboo\/recommended\/258030\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"43822022\">Scorpion<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 33.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBrings back the old school feel of the games from the 90's.

I read that it bears similarity to final fantasy 7 and 10 - Battle\/Overworld system very much like final fantasy games, character's heads are a little big but you get used to the art, has sidequests and a feeling of freedom of movement early on, and it's readily apparent I'll need to return to some of these places later.  I read complaints that there is some grinding but feel that early battles just actually take some strategy - pair up your party for the situation you're facing and it'll go a lot smoother.  Seems like a pretty well thought out game.  Initial impression, good.
