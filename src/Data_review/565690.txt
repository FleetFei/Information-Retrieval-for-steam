You play as Shinboku, who is entrusted with a mission to investigate the town for ayakashi. Shinboku possesses traits from both sexes, being male on the inside but female (well, mostly) on the outside. Shinboku is also short enough to pass off as a grade school girl despite her large breasts that are featured quite prominently in her gothic lolita getup.<br><br>Shinboku encounters various girls under various circumstances, and during the course of the game gets to know them better while the initially vague objective of the investigation leads to otherworldly experiences. The interaction between the characters works pretty well, although some of them end up being quite flexible in regard to their allegiance. In the end I felt that Satsuki had the most fleshed out character, and fortunately the game devotes quite a bit of time, as well as CGs, for her alone.<br><br>The game has a few references to Japanese mythology, and while it doesn't delve too into it as a whole, they come into play at relatively crucial moments as far as the story is concerned. You may want to brush up on knowledge of those stories beforehand if you're only passingly familiar with them like I am, otherwise expect to get busy with Wikipedia while playing.<br><br>While the art style looks nice to my eye, the game does suffer from the typical doujin soft shortcomings when it comes to overall presentation. The backgrounds are filtered photos displayed on the dreaded 4:3 resolution, the music is sporadic at best, and you definitely move the sound effects slider down a few notches before embarking on the journey.<br><br>But as far as the story is concerned, the dialogue is engaging and the world of Ayakashigami kept me interested throughout the game, and for that I give it my recommendation.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28808000', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28808000' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28808000\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28808000' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28808000\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28808000', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28808000_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28808000_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/565690\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28808000"]}
