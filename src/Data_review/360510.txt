It is a 3D Faster Than Light + a few more games mixed in it (most notably Star Trek Bridge Commander) + Ironman experience.  It is there to test the fans of the rogue-like hardcore genre who do not complain about losing stuff or people, getting destroyed, then learning and adapting as a result. There is no save and load function. You roll the roulette and you live with what you've gotten in a beautiful 3d FTL-Star Trek format.<br><br>FOREWORD:<br>If someone says that the game has no replay value, they have played it way too little. Look at my play time. I rarely did the same run twice, unless trying to beat my previous score or testing new stuff.<br><br>The game is out of early access as of today, the 04.03.2015. Sadly, it already received a number of negative reviews during the years of development, so you will be looking at mixed reviews for a while. Most of it was because the devs were trying to find the reasons for the game not launching for a number of people, and those were readily cranking out the negative reviews. FYI, before I start with the good and the bad.<br><br>As usual, I will start with the good and the bad.<br><br>The absolute BEST:<br><br>The game generates meaningful stories through its gameplay, the type that make you take to the forums and share, be it for a win or a loss. How you had a great playthrough until everything started falling apart, people started dying, enemies were swarming you in throves and eventually destroyed you. Or how everything was so bleak, you were out of resources but managed to find a solitary planet where you safely did 6+ probe runs, restocked like crazy and won the game? Or how you went all out berserk and punched your way through the enemy lines like a boss? Or how a single rash decision on an away mission lost you two of your most valuable crew members and it all went downhill OR you still won nevertheless? Yep, all of this is possible. I absolutely love this about a game.<br><br>The Good:<br>1. Beautiful backdrops - the space, the planets and the suns look beautiful. The space must be black by default, but you are playing a game right?<br>2. The ship is also a looker. I personally love the way it appears on my screen with all of its flashing blue red and metal stuff. Once you start building structures, they will also appear inside it, which adds a new level of immersion.<br>3. Resource Management - picking what you want, what you need, when you need it might be the difference between defeat and a victory. Shortages really punish you, and even if you win, it affects your score big time.<br>4. You get to pick your ship parts - this allows for huge customization. You may pick a nimble ship with fewer systems but tons of cargo space, or you can make yourself a juggernaut. with less storage space and better weapons, absorption, shuttle missions, etc. All up to you.<br>5. Last ditch effort - this type of play really reels you in as you see the last 10 000 people of the human race die from lack of food, oxygen, killed by enemies and random events. Speaking about random events...<br>6. Random events are either detrimental (e.g. Alien Flu) or beneficial (Training for crewmembers). This forces you to deal with situations even more strategically, because while fighting, people still die.<br>7. Ironman - no going back. I love this type of play for certain games and this one is certainly worth it, just like FTL.<br>8. You have a decent grid size and you need to pick your way through it till you reach the end goal, dealing with hostile encounters, resource shortages, planet and object exploration, etc.<br>9. The combat - in FTL the combat was minimalistic. Shoot something and it will either hit or miss. Here, you need to think on your feet, use different coloured weapons and shield harmonics, defend and fire when necessary, evade shots, pause, think, and do your best. If you wish you can opt to play completely without pausing - that makes the combat extremely dynamic, but you will most likely suffer way more hits.<br>10. Strategy wins the game - trust me, I felt that. Making rash decisions isn't the best thing. You really need to accept the position you are in and adapt to it. Playing to the strengths of your ship and crew is key.<br>11. Renaming crewmembers - are you a Star Trek, Star Wars, Farscape or another franchise's fan? Or you like to use the names of your closest friends or family members? You can!<br>12. Like FTL, there are multiple ways to victory - at present, I would split them into sneaky, semi-sneaky, bold and reckless types of wins.<br>13. The game lets you do stuff on the fly. You just need to learn the mechanics. I am not going to spoil those for you.<br>14. Runs vary. A faster engine will get you to the end goal quicker, but a battle-hardened combat crew getting you trough 1 vs 3 encounters is a joy to behold.<br>15. Flying through gorgeous space. If you dont like it, it is simply not your jam.<br>16. Play-throughs take about 2 hours, which I find good for these types of games.<br>17. Scoring system that allows you to check how well you did in comparison to the others.<br>18. Many new features added since EA - 3 difficulty settings, ship setups, civilian management, more away missions, etc.<br>19. Replayability has been improved a lot since alpha, so you will be looking at a lot of different runs. While the end goal is the same, just like FTL, nobody forces you to reach it - a full exploration run (mine was the first full exploration run to date) takes about 8 hours.<br><br>Ok. Here's THE BAD.<br><br>The ABSOLUTE WORST:<br><br>You will ragequit if you hate games that punish you. Many a time. Get used to it, or don't buy the game.<br><br>To continue...<br><br>1. Steep learning curve - you need to play with ship setups for a while, learn how they work, what resources to pick at start, how long to stay at a planet, which awaymissions are easier and which ones harder, and so on.<br>2. NO multiplayer, like FTL. Can't be fixed.<br>3. Some bugs are still present, but the devs are all over the community forum, listening to the people and taking notes. Always good to see.<br>4. Combat - while I praised it, one can still find it minimalistic.<br>5. Punishing away missions since alpha. While the death to success ratio has been curbed a bit, and more choices given to the player, one should still exercise extreme caution when taking on away missions..<br>6. Some players still can't launch the game. Best check the forums before buying this game. The devs are hard at work at it.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>The game is quite the looker, and has this FTL last ditch type of feeling. Up until now, the devs have been on the money with the updates, consistently adding more content - with the last patch enabling us to manage the civilian population by adding more buildings, with the option to upgrade them in the future to avoid the constant civilian problems. Whoever says this game is short... is right, but it can also be played is a plethora of ways, adding replayability. Fastest way to goal, explore the whole quadrant, go left side, go right side, be sneaky, fight a lot, try not to fight at all. Or plain handicap yourself if U R A PRO. Just try it! I know I did, with runs with as low as 575 credits. To me, this game is one huge sandbox - I get to pick my difficulty (and by that I don't mean the pre-set ones), my setup, my way to play the game and try to win. It is fun - whether you should choose to challenge yourself or just explore the vast quardant of space and enjoy the extremely atmospheric Into the Stars.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17016356', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17016356' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17016356\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17016356' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17016356\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17016356', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17016356_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17016356_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t267 of 349 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">21 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>14 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21625542\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">Hobbes<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/games\/?tab=all\">3,566 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/\">95 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">So close to Battlestar Galactica, and yet so far. Oh devs, one day you will listen to the Tiger, damn you...<\/div><br>So. Into The Stars, basically, Battlestar Galactica, you are humanities last hope. A colony ship which moves at best at the speed of a flying space turtle on tranquilisers, moving across a fairly hostile chunk of galaxy in the hope of making it to a habitable planet (Titus Nova). The ship's warp core is more or less dead, you're running on limited resources, everything is going to break slowly, and you're fighting progressively worse situations as you go. It's a bit like a lot of games that involve such mechanics (think FTL and its' ilk).<br><br>Now, disclaimer, I kickstarted this game, and I wanted to get involved <i>early<\/i> because I saw the potential in this to be the big BSG experience that everyone was aiming for. It had the team behind it, it had (and has) the graphics behind it, it has the -music- damn it. What it needed was people who could be dedicated playtesters who could shape the game into something great. People with a lot of experience in the gaming arena who know what works and what doesn't. People who understand the limitations of dev time and therefore could have got the ideas in early so they wouldn't have been going down the wrong track on things like combat and so on.<br><br>Problem, the dev team was probably the least communicative that I've ever seen during the KS phase post campaign. It was definitely the least involved KS post release I've been. So I decided to stay well back and wait for the early access release, in the vague hope that hey, these guys looked professional, they'd get this right. I was partially correct.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The problem of developers who cling too tightly to their children.<\/div><br>Into The Stars should be seen as an exercise in why if you have a bad idea, you should discard it as quick as you can, rather than double down on it in an attempt to patch it up and make it playable. The big bugbear in this case was combat. Combat here uses a colour frequency system to determine if a shot gets past your (or your opponents shields) or not. <br><br>This is not good gameplay, because it offers no reward to the player, if they do stuff right, they're basically getting the damage from the weapon that they're supposed to get in the first place (presuming it even hits), and if they do stuff right defensively, then their shields function as advertised (yes, it's possible to hit &quot;deflect&quot; and it do -nothing- if your frequency is the wrong colour).<br><br>Right from the get go I voiced my criticsm about this system, because I could see this being a major issue with the game, it didn't reward the player, and simply punished the player for lapsing in concentration. It was busywork, and busywork without benefit. Instead of seeing this and discarding the colour frequency idea as one that promoted poor design choices, the team instead decided to try to create workarounds such as the &quot;evade&quot; button (which ironically allows you to dodge fire regardless of frequency) and ways of forcing the opponent to flip their frequency to allow you to line up deflections and attacks easier. In effect, sticking to their original idea in the hope they could make it workable. It's STILL bad, when you've multiple foes to fight and you've got this mess of colours going on, it's chaotic, and it's <b>not entertaining<\/b>, it's annoying.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The issues didn't stop there.<\/div><br>The civillian city, created to give the events that pop up some meaning and context, was another idea that didn't promote good gameplay, largely because it lacked thematic background and narrative to tie it in to the game proper. It was bolted on as a means to add work and to try and force you to care about the civillians, except in this case it didn't make a great deal of sense, why were you building these extra modules, why did they need arbitrary numbers of minerals, why did the city appear to be entirely divorced from the ship itself? <br><br>Had the city mimicked the layout of the ARK, and perhaps had you been building additional modules INTO the available cargo space (or indeed, demolishing habitable space to make room for cargo at the cost of civillian homes), THAT would have made more sense narratively, and could have opened up a lot of interesting decisions. As it stands, it feels like a stub that lacks a real sense of place.<br><br>Then there's the mess that is the stat layout and where said stats are used, Engineering being too heavily relied upon with Toughness being a dump stat that seems to have little bearing on much of anything. Again, a matter that was raised before the launch of the game, but not addressed at launch (I fired up the game and to my dismay, you still need engineering for the bulk of your operations, half of your combat duties are reliant on Engineering), my proposal was to slim down the stats from six to five and to more evenly distribute the &quot;workload&quot; of the stats to ensure that each role had a more valid use in the game.<br><br>Augh.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">There's the soul of a good game in here...<\/div><br>And it pains me to say, that I think the devs know there's a good game in here too, but in this case they went down some decisions early on and decided to stick to them too rigidly, rather than fail fast and recover faster. The launch version is polished, but the design issues STILL plague the game. <br><br>Had they listened to the posts I made far earlier (as far back as 0.2 even), and changed course, this might be a very different game, and this might be a very different review. For the better or worse? Who knows. I can't claim to have all the answers, but I know that -these- choices didn't end up making sense, when you added them all together. Perhaps with more iteration and patching, this game will be worthy of recommendation, but for now, I can only very cautiously recommend it to people who have a major BSG itch to scratch.<br><br>Verdict : <b>Very cautious one thumb up, for Battlestar Galactica types.

It's all about time management and hard decisions, such as working out how long you dare stay at one planet mining for essential resources without risking a fatal Threat Level Red battle encounter.<br><br>The chase across space is what makes this game feel exciting, despite the restriction of feeling confined to the captain's chair. Cutting about the galaxy at top speed, wondering if you dare veer off to explore that red planet that'll take you further from your ultimate goal (but may also stop you all starving to death), this is the good stuff.<br><br>Into the Stars gameplay video:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5k5JEgh9NCU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5k5JEgh9NCU<\/a><br><br>There are other more obvious decisions the game throws at you - dialogue boxes that ask you if you want to investigate one of three points of interest on an away mission for potential reward or disaster - but it's the ongoing supply management issues that bring the game to life.<br><br>There's also a surprising 2D action mini-game to play - the further you drill into the planet, the more supplies you get to bring back to your ship. <br><br>Combat is straightforward - you can face up to 3 ships at once. One is trivial, two require careful use of shielding and three require a nerve of steel! There's no tutorial in the release I played but once you figure out that red shields protect against red weapons, yellow shields protect against yellow weapons etc, you feel a lot more in control of the encounters and feel like losing was because you made bad decisions under stress (or kept clicking the wrong damn thing!) rather than the game being unfair. <br><br>I really look forward to seeing how this game develops in early access - it's a tough game as it stands and it should stay tough, but giving the player a little more leeway for exploration of this huge world to go along with the thrill of the chase would be brilliant.<br><br>This review is of the pre-release of the early access version.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16960814', 'summary' );

No, but it is not bad at all for the price.<br><br>My rig is more of a middle of the road machine.

Spice (Out There). And everything nice. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect space survival simulation. But Fugitive Games accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction... Chemical X (bugs, performance and other issues).<br><br><b>Impressions<\/b><br>+ The game delivers an excellent captain's hotseat experience. I want to scream &quot;Captain on deck!&quot;.<br>+ A real sense of urgency to reach Titus Nova especially early game where the crew is inexperienced and modules tend to be one sided, highly costly and not very resource friendly. The game brutally teaches you the importance of foresight and progression.<br>+ Stunning visuals. The ARK-13, distant stars, asteroid field and even solar flares look gorgeous. Nailed it all!<br>+ Great sound effects and brilliant score by Jack Wall.<br>+ Planetary exploration, probe deployment and the mining mini game are well done and challenges the player's morals. Planetary exploration could do with more scenarios and variety in rewards - i.e. increase to population, implementable alien city constructs, researchable blueprints.<br>+ On board city, crew, resource and engineering management tools are nice additions. Could do with greater city management freedom and features.<br>+ The ability to switch between the Captain's chair and exterior camera helps with navigation and appreciation of the universe.<br><br><b>Early access considerations and dev feedback<\/b><br>- There is a performance issue and possibly a memory leak issue too. The game is a CPU hog and demands plenty of juice.<br>- Slight delay between mouse clicks and game response.<br>- No hotkeys. Almost entirely dependent on mouse clicks. Controls cannot be reassigned or tweaked in any way.<br>- The ship alert system needs fixing. Quite often I found it would loop (as if bugged; continuously repeating) the presence + approach of Skorn or trade vessels, depletion of resources or increase in threat level.<br>- Trade ships, enemy patrols and warped Skorn ships quite often incur bugs and freeze in place or fail\/block interaction.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=590312946\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=590312946<\/a><br><br>- Lack of variation in alien encounters, Skorn ship types and enemies. I discovered only one other alien race (Menhit) and had a short exchange of fire. Mercenary ships, pirates, hostile alien species also in seek of refuge or other threats in the Gamma and Delta sectors would add to the variety of threats present.<br>- I enjoyed the overwhelming combat mechanics and 3v1 scenarios, but it becomes a case of constant repetition after the first few playthroughs. Variation in enemy types and Skorn vessels may help spring new combat methods.<br>- Limited trade features. Previous ship modules are lost rather than scavenged or traded for resources. Also needs a galactic trade or space station of some sort (possibly in the Sigma Sector) where trade rates are a little less unfair and one sided. Can also boast a store to purchase (with resources or other means of currency) specific modules or hire crew members. This might even dare players to plunge into the depths of the Sigma Sector other than to reach Titus Nova in the shortest time possible.<br><br><i>I will update this review post update, patch and release<\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20220564', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20220564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20220564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20220564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20220564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20220564', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20220564_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20220564_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17037258\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skullduggery\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"38366564\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/546eacc9a28848b246f5da74db7fa7e4d5ab99c0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/546eacc9a28848b246f5da74db7fa7e4d5ab99c0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/546eacc9a28848b246f5da74db7fa7e4d5ab99c0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skullduggery\/\" data-miniprofile=\"38366564\">HG BeanZ<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skullduggery\/games\/?tab=all\">156 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skullduggery\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/skullduggery\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Into the Stars was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is awesome, and yes while limited - and I'm not usually one to scream &quot;Early Access! It's an understandable setback!&quot; But really, it is. When you buy an Early Access game, you KNOW it isn't finished, you're supposed to be reviewing what has been made thus far. With Into the Stars, the progress made is amazing.<br><br>Pros -<br><br>Graphics are good, but runnable. There is a slight &quot;graininess&quot; to them ingame, but it is easily dismissable by the rest of the space around you.<br><br>Gameplay is fun, and though at times repetitive, it is certainly always different in terms of difficulty. Remember, this game is meant to be similar to FTL's genre of gameplay, and if you didn't like it, you probably won't like this. <br><br>The things you come across in space so far are always interesting, and you almost always have to make that tough decision of sending out one of your trusted shipmates and the possiblity of never seeing them again.<br><br>The difficulty is playable, but you will certainly need a few runs to get used to the learning curve. Like I said before, it's similar to FTL, so you'll need to get used to it.<br><br>The controls themselves are simple and easy to use w\/ a good amount of fluidity to your ship, so even if it does move rather slowly, this makes sense.<br><br>Cons - <br><br>The amount of different events that you'll come across are decent enough but lacking the diversity to really immerse you in the game efficiently.<br><br>The amount of ships in the game is limited and while you certainly feel that the ship is at your command, it doesn't make you feel as though you're actually connected to the ship in any way other than it's now your responsibility.<br><br>The weapons in the game are your classic laser &amp; torpedo duo and the effects are pretty, but after awhile you get used to it and it doesn't surprise you anymore as to the effects. The different &quot;types&quot; of weapons (damage and charge time differences) aren't really enough to fill the gap.<br><br>Glitches come into the game fairly often, but none of them are gamebreaking, more of just small nuisance that is easily fixable by player, but they can certainly be tedious. Though, this is expected, just something to be mindful of running into.<br><br>--------<br><br>If you're looking for a tutorial to play the game, there is a guide in the Guides section of the game's Steam page.<br><br>All in all, I'd definitely recommend the purchase as the game itself is very fun, but as of right now, the replay value isn't of significant importance to really come back more than once or twice. If you want to see this game become more diverse and enjoyable - though it already really is - BUY IT.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17037258', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17037258' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17037258\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17037258' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17037258\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17037258', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17037258_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17037258_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16960702\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"31910237\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/87\/87304fe945550e0fc3177fea2f17a0679cf98284_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"31910237\">CommissarBRO<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/games\/?tab=all\">1,092 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/\">158 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/commissarbro\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Into the Stars was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 9, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBasic Gameplay Overview:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AyvlRp0dPZI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AyvlRp0dPZI<\/a><br>Definitely one of the better Early Access titles I've ever played. Beautiful graphics, gameplay like Bridge Commander and FTL combined and incredibly difficult to boot. This game is an absolute treat. I can't help but feel like an actual Captain aboard a vessel in space... I've had to catch myself from saying, &quot;Warp One, Engage!&quot; while increasing the speed of my ship... if only someone added a Patrick Stewart voice pack then this game would be perfect.<br><br>Seriously though, there is a nice combat system that is based on color coded frequencies utilizing torpedoes, lasers and deflector shields. There are a plethora of alien races both friend and foe alike. A multitude of planets that you can send your away teams to, to find better equipment for your ship or just to salvage resources from on your long journey to a new home. You even get to customize the equipment on your ship and the crew maintaining it before you start your journey. Hilariously enough, you can even name them. There are also a ton of events that occur on the ship to make your life an absolute hell. And really, it's easy to tell that the games man challenge and focus is on resource management. You really have to wonder whether passing by &quot;Pelia&quot; was worth it when you're watching 100 civilians die a day. Protip, take more biomatter and oxygen than the others. Trust me, you'll be thanking me later.<br><br>All in all, this game is absolutely amazing and I readily recommend it to any, and everyone who ever dreamed of piloting their own Star Ship. Now excuse me, I take my leave to don a Fleet Commander outfit and blow up some alien scum.<br>Early Access Video Review:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n24dUXaDpuw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_3\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n24dUXaDpuw<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16960702', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16960702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16960702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16960702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16960702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16960702', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16960702_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16960702_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16972970\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"37803094\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b9082b45f52b95d6035b71d98001ac75d68d3c4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b9082b45f52b95d6035b71d98001ac75d68d3c4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b9082b45f52b95d6035b71d98001ac75d68d3c4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37803094\">Zeno - Gemini Warlord<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/games\/?tab=all\">1,320 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/recommended\/\">43 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zzokalj\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'll keep it simple since this is Early Access build review and will update it as the game progresses.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>+ Responsive and active devs (this is most important thing in Early Access titles and not seen often)<br>+ Constant sense of impending doom (Battlestar Galactica kind of thing)<br>+ Beautiful graphics (guys really nailed it in Unreal engine)<br>+ Bridge view (you feel like a capital ship captain)<br>+ RPG element (Officers level up skills and become better with time)<br>+ Very big map<br>+ Fantastic music!!! (No wonder since it's composed by Jack Wall - Mass Effect series)<br><br><br>Cons: <br>- Ugly UI - I guess guys will work on that, it's fully functional now, I'm just talking about cosmetics. <br>- Fight can be a bit dull sometimes. In bigger fights you need to micromanage weapon and shield frequences faster and that's better.<br><br><br>I won't take game balance as a minus since it's in development, but I should mention it here. Currently, the game is really hard cause it often happens that after a fight you've won, you send your injured officers to repair ship or in sick bay and then get attacked by two or three ships. Of course that leads to death since you don't have avaialable officers to take their positions on the bridge and you are doomed. This will be changed as the game will be tweaked. <br><br>If you love Battlestar Galactica as a story, you will like this. Your homeworld is destroyed and you have a capital ship with 10k civilians and need to run away from Scorn and find a new homeplanet.<br><br>If you love FTL, this is basically FTL in 3D space, more or less. I loved FTL and this was familiar since the moment I started playing.<br><br>If you don't hate Early Access and consider yourself a patient, mature gamer, give Into the Stars a chance.<br><br><table class=\"bb_table\"><tr>\t<td>Graphics: <\/td>\t<td>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td>Sound: <\/td>\t<td>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td>Gameplay: <\/td>\t<td>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td>Potential: (EA)<\/td>\t<td>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span class=\"bb_strike\">          <\/span><\/td><td><span class=\"bb_strike\">          <\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td><b>Overall: <\/b><\/td>\t<td>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16972970', 'summary' );

This is its story...<\/b><br><br>Humanity has been under attack by an alien aggressor known as &quot;The Skorn&quot; for a decade.<br>This is a battle we are losing, drained of resources and manpower defeat is inevitable.<br>The light of humanity is flickering out, but there is a plan, a final hope to avoid extinction.<br>A fleet of massive Ark ships have been built, these huge ships will carry the remnants of humanity away from danger, away from everything we've known, fleeing into the darkness in a last desperate effort to escape the Skorn.<br><br>The ships have all left now, save one, the fatefully named Ark 13.<br>The remnants of humanity, 10,000 souls, are crammed on board the last great Ark ship.<br>As final preparations are underway some important decisions need to be made.<br>Some equipment still needs to be installed, a crew needs to be assigned and resources need to be allocated.<br>These are decisions to be made by the captain of this last best hope, that captain is you.<br><br><br><b>&quot;She'll do the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs&quot;<\/b><br><br>Your first day as captain will see you finalising your requirements for Ark 13.<br>She's your ship now, your responsibility and as soon as you launch into the game you're going to have to start making the tough decisions.<br><br>Ark 13 might be a big ship, but she's going to need a lot of equipment to support the 10,000 evacuees crammed onto her decks.<br>With space at a premium, you're going to have to choose your components wisely.Starting with the ships core systems, you're going to need to choose an engine (to get you moving), a life support system (to keep you breathing) and a protein sequencer (to keep you fed).<br>These core components are vital and you have a selection to choose from, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.<br><br>Choose a big powerful engine and it might give you an impressive top speed (handy for staying one step ahead of the Skorn) but it's going to take up a lot space which will limit your other component choices.<br><br><br><b>&quot;Do not be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed&quot;<\/b><br><br>It's not just a balancing act between space requirements and function either, there's something else you need to consider too.<br>You see, each component you install requires resources to function.<br>Different systems need different resources, and consume them at different rates.<br>There are five resource types in the game, Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Bio-matter, Nitrogen and Magnesium. Your overall reliance on these elements is going to depend on your final component configuration which leads to some agonising decisions.<br><br>For example you might consider an engine which only consumes Hydrogen, but does so at an alarming rate. It might be good to only have to worry about one resource type to keep you moving, but if that's a resource you have trouble finding when your fleeing through the inky blackness of space you could end up drifting unpowered until everyone on board either starves or suffocates (unless the Skorn find you first... at least then your end will come more quickly).<br><br>Maybe an engine that requires two or more resources would be a safer option, it'll probably consume them at a slower rate, but then you need to worry about being able to track down multiple resource types to keep the fires burning.<br>Remember, it's not just the engines that need resources, everything you install on the ship will have its own resource requirements when its active.<br><br><br><b>&quot;She may not be much to look at but she's got it where it counts!&quot;<\/b><br><br>At least with the core systems you'll know that you definitely need one of each type installed, this however isn't necessarily true when it comes to the secondary components.<br>One way or another you're going to need to harvest resources if you're going to survive for any prolonged period of time onboard the Ark.<br>That makes some form of exploration and mining equipment pretty essential too.<br><br>If you want the ability to send away teams down to a planet's surface you'll need a shuttle bay.<br>A mining rig will be needed if you're planning on some heavy duty resource extraction, a mining probe might be handy too, as with the core systems, each secondary component comes in variety of flavours each with their own resource consumption requirements.<br><br>When you've settled on your core systems and resource gathering capabilities there's another set of systems you'll need to think about, shields and weapons.<br>All your efforts will be for naught if the Skorn catch up with you and you can't defend yourself.<br><br><br><b>&quot;I've made a lot of special modifications myself&quot;<\/b><br><br>I hope you've still got some room left after installing all those components because you're going to need to store your resources somewhere too.<br>Whatever space you have left you can fill with cargo bays, the more bays you equip, the more resources you'll be able to carry with you.<br>The more stuff you can carry the further you can go without the need to stop and mine.<br>Pause anywhere for too long and the Skorn are going to find you....<br><br>You'll get to fill your cargo holds up with whatever resources you think you'll need before you launch but this won't last you long, you're survival is going to depend on acquiring new resources to restock your constantly dwindling supplies.<br><br><br><b>&quot;We would be honored if you would join us&quot;<\/b><br><br>One last thing before you begin your perilous journey, you'll need to ...

I was one of the unfortunate ones who were getting stuck behind the Nebraska error. After some attempts I requested a refund. Then an update came out. Loving what I had been seeing, I chanced getting it again. Still prevented by the error :(.<br><br>Some time passed and a work-around came about involving an update to WMSIE. Viola it worked!!<br><br>I was beyond jazzed because everything I read, saw, heard was exactly the game I felt I needed to stave off the fiend until No Mans Sky comes out. time for the nitty gritty.<br><br>The game is as described. A combination of Bridge Commander, FTL, and several other space born titles. At first it can feel over whelming. LOTS of details.<br><br>&quot;Like being on a date with a Librarian, who also is chocolate for the eyes&quot;<br><br>The setup is a big deal as if effects the rest of your ability to survive in the vastness of space. Crew finding is relatively easy, able to sort them by highest rating in their fields and found the crew set up the easiest, although not quite sure of the necessity of a toughness trait, often ignoring it to double up on engineers.<br><br>The hardest (or I should say toughest choice) was the modules. While the urge to get modules that use the same resources, you will discover certain planets can only be mined for specific ones...in  other words, your Ark maybe based around a lot of CO2 usage but find a planet that contains none.<br><br>This is usually the first error I can see made during the first attempt at playing<br><br>The difficulties however are easily tempered through multiple plays....but still can seem overwhelming at first.<br><br>Once past the multiple set up screens you are greeted with a beautiful scenery of planets, asteroids, suns and all sorts of anomalies. The feeling of being able to go anywhere is amazing.  The controls are simple, up down left right roll.<br><br>The game is a graphical beast for sure. The suns have solar flares, the planets have rings of asteroids, there's even half cracked destroyed planets frozen in time.<br><br>Exploring and taking int eh sights is an easy thing to get lost in immediately in this game. The urge to push on is apparent right off the bat, JUST to see more space related eye candy.<br><br>But then comes the first 'break' from this joy. The constant pursuit by the main enemy race in the game. The Skorn. Now I understand the desire to have this element. It gives a constant urgency to keep mushing on. It did however leave me annoyed often when trying to explore a new area, just to find I am getting tracked before even finding anything. BUT its a minor issue and like I said, keeps the constant feeling of 'keep on pushing on', which does force a positive need to progress forward whether u want to or not.<br><br>The space battles are my biggest frown. Often the same battle consisting of 1-3 enemy ships which pretty much may vary in design, but still consist of the same. Now I haven't indulged the game 100% so I am unsure if any other enemy but the Skorn fight you, but have played enough to be able to say I'm pretty sure you don't. This leaves a bitter lack of creativity int he battles. You get into a battle, try to disable a ships weapons, finish them off repeat if more ships. Often battles being purely determined on the ability to be lucky, and your shots come in contact with their targets. However once 'experienced' these battles often become routine, and make little impact other than slowing you down some OR rarely sometimes the rewards from such giving a much needed resource boost. At first, a nice mechanic to the game but ultimately becoming a 'sigh' moment.<br><br>This would be, as the developer, my primary focus when it comes to altering, upgrading, altering the game. More alien vessels to combat, more options in combat, howabout the simple ability to flee would be nice sometimes, even a boarding ability. Often the battles fall on the same 3 basic principles. Phasers, torpedoes, shields. It becomes paper rock scissor type combat. It is attempted to be deeper through a color coordinated battle scheme (red shields absorb red weapons etc) but this falls kinda flat and small enhancement to a drab combat system. It needs to be deeper, enhanced someway, perhaps some form of mini-game to determine effectiveness, accuracy, rate of fire etc. It simply needs to be more in depth especially being 1\/3 of the games entertainment.<br><br>Now aside form combat the games meat and potatoes come from surviving. Managing resources, and finding the methods to go from one end to the other in the galaxy. The sites again, are amazing. The aura, and feel of different parts and lighting effects give a sensed of dream like state, as you approach a sector of random marvel.<br><br>however with the grandness that comes with it, multiple plays lead to a 'almost cramped feeling'&gt; the galaxy is universal, each play has the same layout. While it has TONS of sights, playing many play through's makes even this large galaxy seem small. BUT even so, the sights and number of anomalies leave more to discover even after my 15th play.<br><br>The galaxy is large and the limitations of randomness, are only enhanced by an obvious attention to detail. Random alien vessels litter the galaxy but often only provide a lackluster trading opportunity. This was quite disappointing as I was hoping to combat some of the other vessels and they end up being a minor 'mix' in the formula. Forgettable at worse, minor help at best. It would be nice if the event offered more, like a side mission or something.<br><br>Planetary exploration is descent distraction in the game. Especially when fighting to survive with moments when low on resources, like those that provide food or air, or fuel. Most the time these visits to planets involve drilling for resources which is based around a mini game of guiding a 2d drill into the ground going over the resource squares you need. A simple mechanic but often entertaining as when in a hurry find yourself eager to go fast but with haste often find yourself hitting the 'bad squares' that stop the drilling altogether. This can be frustrating when dealing with an impending patrol and a dire need for fuel\/air\/food necessity. BUT however is tempered with the simple mechanic the more u drill the easier the drilling becomes...with more risk comes greater reward. And after a few ship upgrades the battles become relatively easy so the desire to suck as much resources is an often tease....stockpile and fight, or get a quick fix and flee.....<br><br>Now throughout your travels you will often have ship born emergencies. Stuff from a random viral outbreak, to space raccoon's making a mess. These missions are relatively handled the same way. Assign a crew member to it, depending their level in the particular skill required depends on the rate they finish the objective. A past time event usually only causing issues when finding yourself with many on board ship issues at once and suddenly being attacked as each device needs a crew member to work (phasers, shields, missiles, medical). Not really a major feature but does keep you micro managing things.<br><br>For the price the game is worth it. There's many more features but not enough space to list them. You love space games, you will love this game. With its flaws, still is a gem that needs some more polish!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18486998', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18486998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18486998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18486998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18486998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18486998', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18486998_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18486998_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30898476\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198104351553\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"144085825\">talengray<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGood game, fun to play.

I played an illegal copy that was very glitchy, but I loved the graphics and concept so much that I bought the game hoping that a legit copy would be less glitchy. No not really. <br><br>I still recommend it though. I got it on sale, so it's cheap enough that I'm not bitter about buying it. Maybe other people will have better luck on their systems. <br><br>So far it's fine except for sometimes it will lock up my computer on loading screens. Very annoying, have to restart. <br><br>About the gameplay itself. Well there is a learning curve, but once you get used of managing your resources it becomes fun to explore everything. Battles are entertaining at first, but do become a little tedious as you repeat them over and over. Still it's fun to explore the galaxy and search of random modules for your ship.

There are 5 different resources that you can use or if you feel like it, use one resource for multiple modules which sounds good but drains that resource even faster and you run the risk of finding a planet that doesn't have any of that resource.<br><br>Crew skills can be increased by being successful on away missions or doing training events that pop up, away missions all have chances of faliure which can result in crew dying or being injured. Combat is fairly simple, if the enemy ships shields are red, then you fire with blue or yellow and change colors when they do so your shots don't get absorbed by the shields. You can target the hardpoints of the enemy ships, hull, shields, weapons and sometimes doing this can make fights a lot easier which helps when you have to fight three of them as you only have shields or evade to dodge enemy attacks and each weapon and defence has a recharge time.<br><br>All in all after finally sitting down to play this game properly, I found the first two difficulties were rather easy. On easy I went straight up the middle and got a B rank where's on normal I went to the left and around for a B+ rank having to cut the journey short because I kept running into planets that had no bio on them for my new engines which shared it with the food module.<br><br>I've given pursuit mode a couple of goes but always fall short of making it half way, usually by being destroyed.<br><br>I rather like the game and its a pretty decent time filler and I do recommend it to other people who like the idea of choices you make deciding whether or not you win or lose.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25831182', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25831182' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25831182\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25831182' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25831182\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25831182', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25831182_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25831182_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25717657\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/innercircle\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"17186234\">Soviet<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 hours in.<br><br>It's a gret version of FTL.<br>You take your ship through a map to get to the end.<br>You can design your ships modules.<br>You select your starting crew.<br>THen once you press go it's a race in 3d space.<br>Combat plays out like a rpg battle. you can target their shields weapons or hull.<br>If your weapon settings doesnot match their shields frequency you do damage.<br>You also run onboard repairs and assign your frequency to block their shots.<br><br>Very well done and very engrossing.

Depending on the modules you select for your ship, you will need Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide and other elements to power your shuttles, life support and more.<br><br>Depending on the difficulty you choose, you could face enemy AI in combat anywhere from one or two times to practically constant battles at the higher setting.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">How is it?<\/div>The mechanics are well balanced and fun. The game has an old school PC game feel that is very enjoyable and addicting. The balance involved in managing the civilians on board the Ark, stopping at planets to acquire resources and maintaining vital systems is well done. The combat is similar to an old SNES RPG where everything depends on using the right ability at the right time. Every action has a cooldown timer that changes depending on your crew and equipment.<br><br>I have mentioned old school PC and SNES games when describing this game. The majority of this game involves completely 2D GUI assets. The combat is done in 3D, but in a way that absolutely feels two dimensional. You spend 90% of your time viewing these GUI assets which are reminiscent of a high quality board game. Playing Into the Stars actually felt very much like playing Pandemic the board game for me. Flying the Ark through space is the only truly 3D part of this game and this is done very well with incredible visuals. The mining mechanics, while not unenjoyable are basically a mini game that is very much like a cell phone app. You control a falling drill through what looks like the periodic table of elements and make sure it crashes into the right squares.<br><br>The comic relief in this game is somewhat painful at times. It's not easy to find the right balance of serious gritty gameplay and humor. At times, this game gets it wrong and feels like it's making a joke of the whole idea. Paradoxically, this enhances the old school PC game feeling that I mentioned previously. Which for me is why I am recommending this game. If you like Space Quest, Wing Commander, Pandemic, or just want a game that does something different, unique and fun, this is a great game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">What is wrong with it?<\/div>Into The Stars did crash twice while playing. Both times required me to start a command prompt and kill any unresponsive tasks using taskkill. The task manager could not even be accessed during these crashes. If that is a deal breaker for you, do not get this game. I also experienced a bug at one point that left me stranded in space spinning in circles. I had to kill the task and restart at my latest save. Another problem is that you cannot &quot;save and continue&quot;. You can only &quot;save and quit&quot;. Which means you have to exit to the menu every time you want to save and load the save you just created.<br><br>The game has it's faults visually as well. On the bridge of the ship, there are three animated crew members who are all identical. You will be staring at these three crew members the entire game, knowing that they are cloned meshes that do not represent your actual crew members you have selected. You will notice the one closest to you typing on a keyboard. the animation of the hands is strange and the fingers bend and move awkwardly in unnatural directions. There is also a short clip that plays when you land your mining rig that is not the highest quality and looks like an animation from an old Space Quest game. Markers that track NPC ships will always display in the background, showing through whatever GUI is currently open such as the mining mini game or the mining rig landing sequence.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Summary<\/div>If you've been playing SciFi PC games since the 80s, Add Into the Stars to your wishlist and get it when it goes on sale. Into the Stars brings back something I didn't realize was missing until now and does so with a next gen 3D galaxy in the background. This game is a lot of fun, however, paying $20.00 may leave you dissapointed since the game is prone to crashes and has compatibility issues for some players. This is why I recommend to wait for a sale.

Six officers are chosen once for the whole game, but they gain experience with tasks and battles.<br>The battles are real-time, but are not very high-paced and pretty straight-forward (shoot, evade, set shields). Moreover, you can pause anytime you want.<br>Graphics and sound are really good, the space atmosphere is 100%. Though the distances between space objects are absolutely non-realistic, everything is too close.<br>Downsides: a bit odd controls for the spaceship that cannot be re-assigned, and no &quot;Quit&quot; button, I had to Alt-F4 every time I leave the game.<br>But if you can live with that - everything else makes this game quite good and interesting.<br>Gameplay video review is here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eEkOQeA9hXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eEkOQeA9hXo<\/a><br>[English subs]\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24280410', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24280410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24280410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24280410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24280410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24280410', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24280410_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24280410_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short23273860\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197966586705\/recommended\/360510\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"6320977\">Mythox<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 11.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis game is awesome and it is worth every cent !!
