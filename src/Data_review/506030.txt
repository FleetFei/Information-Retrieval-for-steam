This isn't for everyone. And I don't mean that in the No Man's Sky way where the thing itself is horrible and I'm just trying to justify my money spent - though I won't lie, that's definitely part of it.<br><br>I've seen software similair to this that is cheaper - in some cases even free - and I've seen cases where it's even more expensive. In the end, all these software do the same thing - though one might do a bit more than the other.<br><br>So why do I recommend this?<br><br>Well, I don't. Sort of. I recommend it under certain circumstances and with a discount. Full price ($50) is just insane and not worth it. I got it for $40 and even now I feel kind of robbed.<br><br>I recommend buying this when you can't afford to upgrade your pc. You see, although this software does speed up your gaming somewhat, buying a new processor or graphics card for more money is a way better investment.<br><br>But maybe you're like me. My parents are divorced and somewhere next year I'm planning on leaving for an appartment for myself. I might be able to take one of the two computers with me but I've got two brothers who are also out\/leaving the house and might want to use it sometime. Plus we don't have any spares except some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 laptops that could explode any second.<br><br>With other words, I need my own computer. Which I can't really afford right now, since I have other priorities such as studies and life. And even if I would boost one of the two at my mom's or dad's (that I might not even be able to keep) then at least one of them would still run horribly.<br><br>Anyway, my mom's computer is horrible. It's an old Windows 7 from 2008\/2009-ish. It's got two seperate harddrives, the C drive always being full since it only holds 35GB. For that this program will work excelently as it can free up all the useless space. The games might still run a little bad, but it will be better than how bad it is right now.<br><br>My dad's computer is newer - a Windows 8 from 2012\/2013-ish. Still horrible but with slightly newer cheap junk. Neither of these computers are meant for gaming.<br><br>I've only tried this program on my dad's computer, and it works reasonably well. The interface is horrible and there have been some slight issues with shutting it down. Plus if you update hardware it will want to restart the computer automatically. You can thankfully chose to postpone it but one time when I did want to shut it off it for some reason didn't. Kinda weird, but ah well. I could still do it manually.<br><br>I've noticed a slight increase in FPS. I played AC4 the day before buying this and it had horrible framerate ranging from 20-30 with drops to 10 and 15. Now it runs a steady 30-35, with some slight drops here and there. Not all the settings are at the lowest though, so I might try that next time I play it.<br><br>This is with the &quot;Steam Boost&quot; on, which - supposedly - increases speed by turning off programs. I haven't noticed much of a difference with it on though, but I haven't messed around with it that much either.<br><br>So it's too expensive with a clumsy interface and only a slight increase in FPS. It is however cheaper than buying computer components - though it doesn't give as much of a boost - and can free up useless space easily - something some people (like me) might be happy with.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25397082', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25397082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25397082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25397082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25397082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25397082', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25397082_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25397082_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/506030\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25397082"]}
