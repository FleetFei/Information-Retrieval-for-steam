SETA is very handy if you want to use the stock market as you can sit outside the station and speed up time for some easy early game money. The stockmarkets a bit cheesy as it's too easy to make money, plenty of guides online if that's your bag. <br><br>Reputation:<br>Building up reputation with races unlocks higher teir weapons, ships and equipment for that race; though some missions are easier than others. Patrols are best for rep grinds especially if you can pick up station defence missions in the same sector. Military transport missions are also a good early game source of rep and cash, cargo life support is needed (find at pirate bases) and time limits can be tight, I tend to use manual docking until I get a docking computer.<br>There are missions to avoid such as convoy missions unless you have a decent M6 or better.<br>There's also racial hatred so killing Boron's in Split sectors will get rep for Split but with loss of rep for the Borons, can be useful when rep isn't high enough for missions.<br><br>Boarding:<br>I love boarding, you can wait and get a missile frigate (50mil) using boarding pods and flail barrage missiles but for a challenge try an M3 and TP combination (recommend Geochen), there's plenty of guides on you tube. It's tough but very rewarding and gets you access to some big ships you could'nt otherwise afford in the early game. This type of boarding is called 'spacewalk' as you dump your marines close to the target and hopefully they make it to the hull alive, salvage insurance (quicksave) invaluable.<br>Early game targets should be TM and M6 class ships until your marines have levelled up. An M6 that can mount ION Disrupters will make boarding much easier, you get a Centaur as reward doing the Argon story line, it'll come with some marines. <br>The Hyperion Vanguard, a paranid ship which can't be bought is about the best player ship there is, you'll find it in paranid sectors. If your not ready to board buy an m5 and put it on follow to keep track of it.<br><br>Marines:<br>It's a pain training marines, when buying go for the fighting stat as it can't be trained, they get better at fighting if they survive a boarding mission. Train all in engineering, a couple in mechanical and hacking.   <br><br>Factories and complexes:<br>This is where the real money is, setting up a lucrative Bliss place in Teladi territory will fill your coffers in no time but you can't beat well designed complex either for money making or for kitting out your fleet with missiles. Check google for the complex calculator.<br><br>OOS:<br>Out Of Sector plays a big part in X3, basically every sector your not in is OOS and the rules change. OOS combat for instance relies more on shields than weapons so fighters like the Falcon Hauler with 200mj shield fair very well even though they have very little weapon energy.<br>Docking also becomes instant, telling a freighter to dock and then jumping out the sector and using SETA will speed things up with no risk of your freighter crashing into a station.<br><br>Carriers:<br>Setting up carriers is quite labour intensive, I suggest the Solano M4, good shields and can be bought in bulk (10 at a time) and they can be equiped en mass though Legend Home doesn't provide much in the way of ship equipment.<br>Setting your fighters into wings and asigning their homebase makes life alot easier. <br>One of my favorite early game strategies is to head for Yaki space and grab a Chokaro, it holds 3 fighters and good storage space for jump drive energy and missiles for restocking, there also handy for picking up ships that bail.<br><br>Plugins:<br>Plugins, except for the bonus pack, add 'modified' to the game so no achievments but there are some great mods out there. Grab Cycrow's plugin manager and the no-steam.exe.<br><br>Check these out:<br>XRM<br>Pirate Guild 3<br>Yaki Armada<br>NPC bailing<br>Improved Boarding<br>Marine Repairs<br><br>I can't recommend this game enough, just don't buy X-Rebirth it's a different game altogether ;)<br><br>Best X3 website:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/roguey.co.uk\/x3ap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >https:\/\/roguey.co.uk\/x3ap\/<\/a><br>Complex Calculator:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/grangegame.co.uk\/x3tcocc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/grangegame.co.uk\/x3tcocc.html<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30488396', 'summary' );

Otherwise you best steer clear for fear of tripping and falling down a rabbit hole from whence your real life will never return.  Im only slightly joking.  <br><br>There are two games I have ever played that I truly love on one hand and truly regret on the other.  The first is Dark Souls, which drained away my entire year of 2011. The second, is this game and its predecessor, Terran Conflict.  I have played X3 for probably 1000 hours and it was a major contributing factor to my college GPA dropping seriously about 3 full tenths of a point and leading to a few failed classes that I had to stay an extra semester to retake.  There were other factors too dont get me wrong, but seriously if you don't have a healthy lifestyle to fall back on and you are a sucker for space sim type games this game might hook you and never let go until one day you stumble out of your apartment, blinded by the sun, realizing you havent shaved in 8 months and have lost 30 pounds and arent sure what year it is or what happened to your life or any of the people you used to know.  It is simultaneously the best and most dangerous thing you can buy for twenty dollars.  Whats sadder still is my hard drive failed and so I literally have nothing to show for at least 800 hours of my life.  Holy Sh!t.<br><br>I tell you all this because theres no way to sum up what you can actually do in the game in any reasonable amount of words, but heres a few useful bits I have divided rather arbitrarily into 3 good points and 3 not as good points.<br><br>Good stuff:<br><br>1: Think of EVE Online, except its a single-player sandbox with about 200+ beautiful sectors populated by about 8 races, each with their own ships, technologies, stations, food supply chains, goods, etc. <br><br>2: You also can actually fly your ship (theres hundreds to choose from, some you'll have to capture but seriously you'll find something you love) itself with wasd or a joystick and dogfight unlike in EVE.<br><br>3: You can basically do whatever you want from escorting passengers or assassinating criminals to mining manually or by setting up individual stations, fill holes in the economy to help AI fractions or build self-sustaining war fleets or illegal drug empires and supply chains that exist only in a single sector or stretch across the universe via automated trade fleets operating out of closed-loop complexes.  You can of course be a pirate too, ejecting marines out of you cargo hold and watch them jet-pack onto a ship and cut their way through the hull and kill everything inside while you delicately keep the ships shields down on the outside (otherwise your poor meat-puppets will fry and you'll be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 cause training them is time sucking and expensive).  You can command huge fleets by piloting one ship, waiting till its on its last leg, ejecting into space, and teleporting into the cockpit of another one within 15km of you and keep hopping around as needed, some engagements can go on for a few hours if you want them too.  Heck you can even be a bloody day trader using the stock market.<br><br>The less good parts (and things to take note of to help you).<br><br>4: The interface takes some getting used to as its not all that intuitive but theres so many options and key bindings that I can see why making one would be hard.  You also need to remember that software upgrades and racial notoriety are the keys usually to success in the game.  You also need to pay attention to what areas need what goods and set up satellite networks to watch prices and supplies.<br><br>5:  The vanilla universe can be a bit dry though because the AI factions and even the pirates arent always aggressive enough towards you or each other.  The economy can also kind of sputter out in certain areas if you don't help it out.  That said, I highly recommend you go to the Egosoft forumsd an download either the X-Tended Mod or the XRM mod as that will solve this problem.  You wont be able to get achievements but who cares about that anyway?  It also might disable the plot but the plot missions are soo long and absurd for such little story in return that most players dont bother and just create thier own roleplay story as the play in the sandbox.<br><br>6:  I find managing large fleets to be difficult as there just arent enough options available for commanding large groups of them in meaningful ways.  The combination of SETA and autopilot can make things either crash into staions occasionally or make AI ships circle each other forever without ever being able to accurately hit each other.  Little bugs here and there like jumping through a gate in a large ship and accidentally ramming into a smaller ship on the other side and killing it, so the po-po comes after you.   Large trade fleets are tough to cause you rely so much on remote piloting by software commands and it becomes tough to keep track of them all and rememebring what routes you have going where, what sectors to avoid because of the Xenon and whatnot.  Again scripts and mods can fix a lot of this stuff though and I HIGHLY recommend modding the game as any issue you have with it or any added feature you would want someone has though of on Egosoft forums and has made a script for it.  The community is really helpful and dedicated, though it has shrunk some because of the unforgivable mess known as X;Rebirth  I should also mention theres a few exploits in the game too like nVidium mining and stock market abuse.<br><br>I hope you find this review to be of some use to you.  Be aware of what happened to me and tread carefully.  Its a great game for those with patience, intellect, and no hope of success in the real world.  It is probably a grave risk for anyone else.  If you do take the plunge on an X game though, this is the one to get.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10033905', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10033905' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10033905\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10033905' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10033905\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10033905', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10033905_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10033905_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t101 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/recommended\/201310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12664827\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48409079\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac9f67a5a49568cc1c89c389c96130c6b97d206f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac9f67a5a49568cc1c89c389c96130c6b97d206f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac9f67a5a49568cc1c89c389c96130c6b97d206f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48409079\">CampingKarl<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/games\/?tab=all\">154 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008674807\/recommended\/201310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">419.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 27, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe metacritic review score, in this case, I would personally say is innaccurate. This game is immense, with a small price tag for the hours you can get out of it.<br><br>If I had to describe the game to someone, I would call it a singleplayer EVE online. But not only that, its a game where at the beginning you can scratch out a living as a trader in a universe with a living economy, or you can take part in skirmishes to fight your way to the top. Thing that I love about this game is the fact that say a pilot bails from a target ship, or you purchase a new ship. You can actually issue orders via a command console to any of your ships, including your current ship. Now of course you can fly them all yourself as well and take part in dog fights, launch boarding parties at vessels, or even later in the game take part in capital vs. capital ship battles. You could start a trading empire and purchase software for trade ships under your command where they act autonomously, seeking deals across the galaxy in your name. My point here is, the ability to loadout ships and amass fleets essentially means that if you choose so, you can turn the game into an RTS. The game can be as hands on as you make it, basically.<br><br>Not to mention, you can purchase and construct space stations and factories yourself, impacting the economy. Prices rise and fall across sectors, a stock market exists impacted by station construction or destruction, and various races have different products. You have reputation with these factions as well, and there are randomly generated missions that appear constantly at stations during play. You can pick sides in a large scale conflict between two of the factions, or go after a specific race yourself in a bid to become a pirate lord.<br><br>As I mentioned above, the game has immense potential for fun here. Being a sandbox game however, I will say the storyline missions for this game are poor. Sometimes bugs occur, your auto pilot can run you into things, etc. However, the flaws i've seen are vastly outshined by the positives, IMO. The graphics arent extremely good, as can be expected from a title getting a few years older now. No performance problems to mention except for occasional slow down during large battles, particle effect apocalypses, and certain nebulous sectors. The game IS also running calculations for an immense number of things in the background though!<br><br>One other large thing to mention is there was quite a large modding community for this game. I personally run the X Rebalance Mod, and it has made my game much better, fixing and filling out features. Recommend it as well, though there are plenty of other mods out there worth checking out too. I will say modding here is not quite as easy as say, skyrim, using the workshop to place the new files automatically.<br><br>+ Combat is thoroughly enjoyable, dogfights with fighter class ships a favorite, ducking in and out of capital ship fire<br>+ Diversity in styles and types of ships, i enjoy diversifying my fleet<br>+ Nonviolent methods to amass wealth and power as well, using trade to satisfy requirements for sectors<br>+ Large number of mods out there<br>+ RTS style commands for your ships<br><br>~ Graphics are looking dated<br>~ Sandbox haters, steer cleer!<br><br>- Bugs are occasional, but often when it rains it pours: autopilot &amp; asteroids dont mix!<br>- Collisions: Your ships can seem magnetized. you will become frustrated, trust me. Theres a mod for that though!<br>- Poor plot missions<br>- Randomly generated missions can become repetitive<br>- Difficult learning curve -- There are tutorials and guides!<br><br>Plenty of people steer towards a certain type of 'space sandbox' but I for one have found my favorite game in the genre. No telling how many hours I'll end up with.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: Haven't played X3:Terran Conflict, or any other X3 game, ONLY X3: Albion Prelude! I've heard X Rebirth was shoddy, don't buy that thinking &quot;its the next game, must be better!&quot;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12664827', 'summary' );

After spending 170 hours on this game and just finishing all of the plots it has to offer, I consider it convenient to write an accordingly comprehensive review of this masterpiece.<br><br>I would like start with noting that I've been playing the X series for several years, starting with <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >X2 The Threat<\/a> and spending the most time on <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2820\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >X3 Terran Conflict<\/a>, which makes me consider the 170 hours of story gameplay quite a generous ammount of time a sandbox game has to offer, needless to say that I already knew all the controls from the previous games. But this game is not about to be ended by finishing the story, since it's a sandbox with a vast modding community, allowing to add even more amazing experience to it. Within those 170 hours I've only merely scratched the surface of what it has to offer, and didn't even find enough time for some complex constructing, as I did in TC.<br><br>Albion Prelude is a great improvement over Terran Conflict, most notably the UI and hull overhaul, which means a much better use of wide screens and longer capital ship combat. All the tiny features which were simply missing from TC are now added and some of the flaws fixed (within the engine's capabilities), Xenon Hub no longer takes months to complete, and boarding is slightly less frustrating thanks to the heavier missiles having an actual hull value, so they won't explode after a first hit with practically anything. Some new ship classes were added aswell, including the military freighter, light carrier (drone frigate), and the heavy destroyers. That being said, I see no point in continuing Terran Conflict anymore, as Albion Prelude completely takes over it - just forget about the other X3 games if you only wish to get the most polished-out gameplay, not caring for the lore or story at all!<br>The war which takes place throughout the game seems fun from the start, as the mighty Terran fleet clash with Argons over several sectors, but I don't find it very interesting due to the rapid response fleet and it's random behaviour, with enemy ships spawning out of thin space near your vessels, even in a friendly sector.<br>A slight spoiler regarding the war and how to deal with it once and for all:<br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>it can be ended during the Shady Business plot, after choosing the option to turn against the pirates instead of capping\/destroying the Ozias<\/span><\/span>.<br><br>The game is already content-rich enough that it needs no modding at all - at least not for the story and achievement getting period. Some of the ages-lasting downsides of X also carry over, since it's still the same old engine being desperately improved upon, including the clunky autopilot and not-the-most reliable AI pilots. A simple solution to that is to not use autopilot within Terran sectors (or not use it at all- manual flight with SETA is almost always the fastest option), and to not use AI wingmen way too often. It is usually possible to deal with anyone on your own, without the need for vast fleets.<br><br>As for the modding part, I suggest the <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/forum.egosoft.com\/viewtopic.php?t=262446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >cockpit mod<\/a> as it brings a lot of immersion into the game, and for dealing with the clunky AI constantly crashing into stations, there's the <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/forum.egosoft.com\/viewtopic.php?p=3504935\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Bounce mod<\/a>.

Albion Prelude now offers over <b>200 sectors<\/b> to visit and over <b>350 ships<\/b> to fly with, has a <b>beautiful calming soundtrack<\/b> accompanied by exquisite starry sector backgrounds, is <b>virtually crashless<\/b> (unless you screw up with mods, audio codecs, or some other technical stuff), has a <b>highly responsive UI<\/b>, completely controllable by keyboard which is great for macros (you would be surprised but it's really useful as it can make accessing some deeply burried menus lightning fast), and the game has an enormous replayability potential, both vanilla and modded. I think it's really fine-coded and thus enjoyable, unless you're trying to run it on a calculator.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Things to take in mind before getting into the <b>X Universe<\/b><\/div>The X series have always been quite difficult to grasp for newcomers and it's crucial that you arm yourself with a lot of patience for the first few days. You are going to die many times and probably get overwhelmed by the scale of the world aswell. It lacks a decent in-game tutorial and it won't guide you everywhere, so you do your best by looking up some beginner tutorials online before giving up entirely. For X3AP, the Argon Peacekeeper gamestart has the main plot of the game, but based on my experience I would rather suggest that you pick something a bit more peaceful first, such as the Humble Merchant. Master the controls and understand how trading works before engaging on something more serious, and you will relieve yourself of most of the trouble. <br><br><br>The newest game of the series, <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2870\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >X Rebirth<\/a>, is showing a promising return to the forgotten roots of the old gameplay which took an unrepairable and undesired detour after X2, and the next X game will hopefully deliver us the features and content that most players still staying with X3 have been yearning for. But the original X series will always remain it's honorable place in my space sim heart.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

made!<br><br>The game is a mess, incredibly confusing even after hundreds of hours of gameplay (try to stay 1 month without playing it and I assure you you will forget how to do some stuffs), sometimes boring as hell... and yet, you keep playing it, year after year, expansion after expansion... you keep building your empire somewhere in the galaxy, you keep trading, fighting, exploring... and then you stop playing it, you leave it for months, perhaps a year, and someday you play it again, you try another start, and than you are upset again with all the mess, with the odd menus, with the bizarre steps to do simple things, you try to stop playing... and then... you keep playing it, you keep dreaming about new ships, new factories, new objectives... and when finally you turn it off, you can still listen to the girl's machinal voice when you enter a new sector : &quot;Bala Gi Joy&quot;, &quot;Menelaus Frontier&quot;...<br><br>This is the worst best game of all time ever!

With consequences.<br><br>* Virtual Economy <br>You can affect or be effected by wide and witty created economy system, dont expect a huge touch in this, but know that it will certainly spice up the gameplay<br><br>*Variety in Ships\/Stations<br>The spaceships you can use, destroy, board, capture or disable are plently. Different classes (Scout, Fighter, Heavy Fighter, Destroyer, Carrier, Transport, Cruiser, Capital Ship, Boarding Ship, Missile Boat, Lasertower and many more)<br>Each Race owns different stations with different properties which require different materials, goods and also provide different resources or weaponry parts etc.<br><br>* Quests, Tasks, Missions<br>Besides the main story, there is a VERY large range of things to do in the game.. Buy the asteroid data or sector maps, build stations for others, follow ships to their secret meetings, escort or raid ships etc. You will find many things to keep yourself busy if desired.<br><br>* Immersive Design and Fluentness <br>It may sound weird, but you know there are some games that you want to play awhile but ending up playing hours of it and not even know how the time passed... Yeah, its that because there is always a great transition between the things you did, can do and will do in the game that you wont find a proper time to say : Ok Im done with it for today<br><br>* Harsh environment <br>You can deny if you want but we all know that is always better to succeed a hard task than a simple one... Sometimes, your mistakes or miscalculations in industry will cost you severely. Good thing is, there is always a way to bounce off the bottom rise again, it pushes you to think while playing too.<br><br>* Quality Soundtracks<br>That is actually my opinion, but usually every sector you fly to will put you in the mood of that zone... Except combat, combat music is a bit.. meh... But again, that is just my opinion<br><br>* Mod Support<br>Does this Need explanation? Very large texture or gameplay mods to improve gaming experience... DUH!..<br><br>NEGATIVE<br><br>* Insufficient Tutorial<br>Well the game does have a tutorial system, but just enough to say &quot;yes it does have it&quot; it only teaches you the basics and the most fun parts (advanced systems, complex installations, running economy, ship design and weaponry etc.) are either learned from the internet or experience... It was both in my case. So be patient if you really want to taste the game's true potential and trust me, its not Quantum Physics, you can get the hang of it in no time.<br><br>* Needs more User-Friendly Prompts, Commands and Interface<br>What I mean is, this game is very deep and large in scale and detail that even though game offers very advanced and complex ways to fulfil your tasks or goals you still need various interactive ways to make things more accurate or better. It falls victim to its own depth in gameplay.  (There are plenty of mods to improve this, you can still be satisfied with the current system if you aren't a fan of mods and prefer vanilla experience, so no worries)<br><br>* Minor AI problems<br>As I said, they are minor... Sometimes (Rarely) a huge transport ship you hired from Paranid Empire can not fly to the jump gate because of small asteroids or similiar objects and detours indefinitely. This has very simple solutions with no fix or mod requirement (like flying out of sector and waiting for it to come) and similar little problems like these. In case it is needed, mods to fix these issues can be found throughout the web.<br><br>* Needs More<br>Yes, yes I know I said this game has plenty to offer but you would understand if you played. They make the game so large that you will start asking for more even though it has serious amount of features in it already... Frankly, they released a patch (which is in expansion pack size) with a whole bunch of new things and 2 major storylines and more sectors with races and such... The developers provide, respect.<br><br>OVERALL<br><br>I would give this a clear 8.5 \/ 10 <br>Mainly because it gave such an experience that I bothered to write a review about it!... Oh yeah, its my first review. Hurray.<br>Also, I have played EVE Online for 4 years so if you already know that game, you will be familiar with the concept of this game. I also recommend X3 Terran Conflict &amp; Albion Prelude to those who own the latest X title (X Rebirth) because you will witness completely different experience nevertheless!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8977637', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8977637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8977637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8977637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8977637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8977637', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8977637_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8977637_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12896026\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007470557\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"47204829\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7eb86a98d34da786dc134603a248c7169791a9fa.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7eb86a98d34da786dc134603a248c7169791a9fa.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7eb86a98d34da786dc134603a248c7169791a9fa_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007470557\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47204829\">TriXx<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007470557\/games\/?tab=all\">107 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007470557\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007470557\/recommended\/201310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1,872.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 11, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game has claimed many an hour from me, and rightfully so.

Reunion and Terran conflict surround a core story of the game, with TC (in terms of gameplay) being an improvement on Reunion in virtually every way.   This game (AP) is the most polished installment of X3;  but it has little in the way of plot, vs the other games.   It has little in the way of ttorial and everything else.  Which means, any user is basically going to find themselves completely at a loss for what they should be doing.   I only mention this by way of saying, if you haven't played any of the X games, start with X3: Terran Conflict.   It is much more acessible (though this game's learning curve is almost vertical) than AP.   Once you feel comfortable with the game, and have a sense of the Universe you're in, then you may want to give this a shot.   <br><br>AP improves in several ways on TC, with improved AI, improved long-distance (OOS) combat results, and better balance for ship strengths (hull plating is no longer made of paper mache).  So for veterans of the series, this ogame is top.   It lacks virtually any story, really...but that was never the most interesting part of these games anyway, was it?\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12871419', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12871419' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12871419\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12871419' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12871419\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12871419', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12871419_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12871419_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19796140\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009357911\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"49092183\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009357911\/\" data-miniprofile=\"49092183\">Iosonos<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009357911\/games\/?tab=all\">355 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009357911\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009357911\/recommended\/201310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1,098.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 19, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWell, what's there to say about the game Steam lists as the single largest time-sink in my library?<br><br>It's good.<br><br>With any suspense now ruined, let's continue with the review.  X3AP is a game that has a 12 year legacy behind it, itself nominally the expansion to X3:Reunion released in 2005.  It's &quot;Yet Another Elite Clone&quot; (the 1984 grandaddy that defined the Space Sim we all know and love today), part of a series that had done at the time what no other Space Sim could:  it faithfully expanded upon the core gameplay and scope of space sims.<br><br>Before Elite: Dangerous, the X series was considered the spiritual successor to Elite, and X3AP stands as the final product from years of refinement.  X3AP is far from a perfect game; its quirky with flat race and character design, simple narrative and mission systems, and plays better as a sandbox &quot;universe&quot; than it does as the story-driven experience it toys with.  The UI is functional but clunky and opaque without practice.  Its learning curve is more of a mountain, however the game's designed to be picked up piecemeal without forcing all of the meta and control systems down your throat at start.  It crashes, somewhat often, and many of the useful time-saving features (like in-space save) have to be earned.  Music can be glitchy; I've had it improperly download the music files on clean installs before and have found out recently these files might be the cause of some of my crashes.  Auto-pilot will end up killing you more often than missiles if you use it, and combat's fun but somewhat simplistic.<br><br>Sounds like a solid 6-7 &quot;meh&quot; of a game, right?  Except that it isn't.  At the time X3 came out, it was a visually stunning game that pushed the benchmarks of PCs and user expectations.  Its dynamic world system created actual working trade where destroying a transport could affect the economy of a sector, either raising prices for the needed items or causing its weapons or munitions production to stop.  GoD (The Global Decison Engine... I know, we call it GoD anyways) would remove factories that were no longer in use and add new ones as required creating a unique playthrough every time.  It also creates military patrols for the different races in order to protect areas that come under attack and pirates to disrupt trade.  There's even times when &quot;war&quot; happens, with two race militaries facing off in large skirmishes within sectors (this is different from AP's War Sectors, although it's pretty rare to see).  And the universe is always running, even for the sectors you aren't in, the game calculates the lives of near a hundred sectors filled with ships and factories.  Profit and death continues, regardless of what you do. <br><br>Add to this a vibrant world where there's no &quot;tier&quot; system of ships, and all races offer competitive fleets to choose from that follow unique fleet doctrine (eg, Split field fast and aggressive ships, Teladi defensive and slow) while also giving players a chance to OWN their own fleets and factories and command their own battleships.  It's expansive,  it's literally a game greater than the sum of its parts.  And AP has only honed this by adding new features (namely the war zones, some ship upgrades, and the stock market), some re-balancing and overall improving the experience to make it a solid 2011 game.  It's a game with few peers if any (I haven't played Eve).<br><br>If it sounds too complicated or in depth for you, I don't blame you.  It can take more than 40 hours of playtime to hit &quot;mid-game&quot; of a playthrough.  There's a great modding community which can expand on the game's playability endlessly.  The game's script engine is readily accessible if you want to try adding in new features.<br><br>If you think you're up to the challenge, I highly recommend this game to you, if only until the release of the 2016 &quot;next gen&quot; Space sims.<br><br>If you're reading this and No Man's Sky, Star Citizen, and Limit Theory are already released?  I'd recommend watching their LPs and getting those games first (assuming they're good).  Afterwards, get this.  X3AP is a milestone in the Space Sim genre.

Now, something I want to point out is that while the base game is already loads of fun, the fun is multiplied by 100 when you download mods. Into Star Wars? Check out the Star Wars Reborn mod. Just go on youtube and search &quot;X3AP Star Wars&quot;<br><br>I would like to point out something, which is that if you wait you can get X3AP and X3: Terran Conflict all in one for a couple of dollars on sale.

I played the heck out of this game on the disk version and had to buy it again for steam when I lost my disks and upgraded to my monster computer.  On my new rig it plays better than ever.  Battles with hundreds of ships seemless with now drop if FPS.  Love how complex it is.  Not like the new game they came out with.....( I bought the new computer for the new X game...it sucks.)  Went back to this one to play and I am once again building my army and managing my trading empire!!!  Can't say how much I love this game.  Still looks great for being six years old.
