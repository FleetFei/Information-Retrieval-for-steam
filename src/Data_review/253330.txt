Hopefully people find it helpful. <br><br>This isn't a typical horror game. It's not about startling you with jump scares. It's about creating a tense and oppressive atmosphere that mirrors my experience with mental illness. <br><br>It's not very game-y. Some may describe it as a &quot;walking simulator&quot;. While it is true the main mechanics are walking, this was a deliberate design choice. The game is about disempowerment and vulnerability, which is important to creating a horror experience. To further the vulnerability, the main character has asthma. That means he can't run very far without stopping to get his breath, and we use the stamina to create tense situations.<br><br>We wanted to create a focus on immersion. That's why there is no UI, hud, or traditional game mechanics. We want you to forget you are playing a game and get lost in our nightmare-scapes. <br><br>It's not very long. A playthrough to one ending is between 1.5 and 2 hours. However, we have 3 different endings with unique content leading up to them, so I would recommend playing all nightmares. That will add another hour or two to your playtime.<br><br>Will you like this game? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a unique take a horror with thick atmosphere, then I think you'll love what we are offering. If you are turned off by short games or ones without a lot of challenge, then this may not be the game for you. It's tough to make a game that appeals to everyone, but I think we've created a special game that a lot of people will really love.<br><br>Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the game! :)<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12330417', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12330417' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12330417\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12330417' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12330417\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12330417', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12330417_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12330417_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t397 of 472 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12247517\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"74196682\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74196682\">Spirit<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/games\/?tab=all\">865 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/\">61 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 26, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer\/publisher!<br><br>\u201cNeverending Nightmares\u201d is one of the more aptly named titles for a game on Steam (y'know, besides &quot;Shannon Tweeds Attack of the Groupies&quot;), because that is exactly what will plague you upon playing it: never-ending nightmares. This is bleak, brutal, and brief \u2013 like every good horror should be.<br><br>As Thomas you wake up from a nightmare... only to realize that you're still asleep, still dreaming. And like a Freudian Dante you'll make your descent down the increasingly bizarre and menacing circles of your inner Hell searching for your Beatrice... of sorts. The world is sketched starkly and wildly in black and white (like a schizophrenic's scribblings) with the occasional accent of blood red and sickly yellow to mark manipulable objects and pretty much every childhood fear, irrational or otherwise, you still foster in your beating heart: darkness, gore, claustrophobia, self-harm, asylums, creepy porcelain-skinned, raven-haired girls, dolls... it touches on them all. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing dolls. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing dolls and raven-haired girls, man. Some people are afraid of heights. Some people are afraid of clowns. I'm afraid of dolls and women with black hair and fair complexions. And if you aren't, you will be.<br><br>The atmosphere is thick in this one. As you progress slowly from room to room and area to area, the game will do its damnedest to put you on edge. China will crash to the floor with no prompting, birds slam into windows with suicidal intent, and shadowy figures dissipate as you draw close. Then the tension will ease off, and your guard will be lowered. That's when the game will hit you. And it will hit you relentlessly. As I've said, this will touch on all your creeping nightmares... and perhaps some new ones will blossom. How great for you! \u201cNeverending Nightmares\u201d utilizes its jumpscares effectively. While they are numerous, they're only as scary as the atmosphere allows and let me tell you, it abides.<br><br>According to the \u201cAbout This Game\u201d section, \u201cNeverending Nightmares\u201d is in part inspired by a developer's own struggle with mental illness. And that absolutely comes across in the game. The jarring, not-initially-clear story, the imagined monsters... and the real ones; the soft, distorted, plinky music and \u201cmental ward sketching\u201d look of the art... it feels very personal. And the game benefits from it. This is a man's soul laid bare, complete with an intimate, artistic peephole into his troubled mind. It gives the game character. More importantly, it makes it that much more terrifying and tangible.<br><br>\u201cNeverending Nightmares\u201d doesn't overstay its welcome, keeping it fresh and frightening. And with the divergent endings you'll likely get some replayability, but don't expect to revisit this one over and over as it's fairly linear. It isn't all that challenging either, though that isn't why I play horrors. I play them to have a story told to me... a story told to me by an unspeakable horror that has me bound to a chair in basement with a lone, swinging light bulb above my head. And it's on the fritz. <br><br>\u201cNeverending Nightmares\u201d is one of the better ways to ring in a new spooktastic October.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12247517', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12247517' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12247517\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12247517' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12247517\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12247517', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12247517_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12247517_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t151 of 163 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13031353\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Asgorath\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51025812\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f3602d2ad2c4338f13c5fdced6c743b778692de9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f3602d2ad2c4338f13c5fdced6c743b778692de9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f3602d2ad2c4338f13c5fdced6c743b778692de9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Asgorath\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51025812\">Asgorath<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Asgorath\/games\/?tab=all\">193 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Asgorath\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Asgorath\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 21, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile I really enjoyed this game I do think it's good to know what you are getting into as this game is not for everybody. I've seen some reviews and comments where people complain this game is both short and has very little real game-elements. Both of which are true. So if you are looking for an action packed lengthy horror-game, this might not be the best choice for you. If you however enjoy atmosphere and an 'experiance' this is really worth picking up.<br><br>Neverending Nightmares is more like games such as Dear Esther, Gone Home or even Journey. It's not really the gameplay or the length. It's all about being sucked into an experiance and the atmosphere being presented to you. It's still very different from those games however. For one this is a really disturbing exeriance, it's a horror game after all. It does have some mild puzzle solving (how to avoid some enemies). The main thing is the visual style. The art, both graphically and sound make this game and this experiance.<br><br>Knowing that you are going through things in the game based on the real nightmares the developer experianced being clincally depressed also helps to better understand the game. You aren't playing it for the sake of playing it as a video-game. This is experiancing the night-terrors of another real humanbeing.<br><br>Minor downpoints is that you sometimes do have to walk a lot before something new happens. I understand it's building tension, but sometimes a few less rooms would have helped. Ironically, the game might have been better if it has been slightly shorter in that sense.<br><br>Your sense of 'dread' also depends on the imagery, sound effects and jump scares. You quickly learn that death doesn't really impact. Which I do find a good desission. It's not about avoiding death, it's about the atmosphere. By the end however I could predict there an enemy encounter would probably happen as a bedroom was also nearby (if you 'die'  you awake in the closest bedroom). <br><br>All in all I highly recommend this game and hold it in high regard. But know it's not a game for everybody.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13031353', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13031353' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13031353\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13031353' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13031353\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13031353', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13031353_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13031353_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t182 of 211 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">20 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14799922\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75389846\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75389846\">Stefneh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/games\/?tab=all\">959 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/\">124 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 8, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWas very keen to try this one... (Watch out people, another long one. This one\u2019s slightly personal).<br><br>\u2026for a few key reasons!<br>In its description it reads \u201cNeverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's actual battle with mental illness.\u201d, \u201cNightmare worlds inspired by real life struggles with OCD and depression\u201d. Which are all points of interest for me. I really enjoy psychology and I have had more than my fair share of mental illness myself in much of the same respects. Being someone who has also had experiences with depression and night terrors, it was almost personal to me. I had to try this game. <br><br>I\u2019ve read very mixed reviews on this. <br>Some love it, others think that it\u2019s not a horror, not scary or compelling enough to play because of its \u201cWalking Simulator\u201d qualities. Which I\u2019d have to say is true to certain extents, there is quite a bit of walking, but the nature of this game is not the norm. This isn\u2019t a typical horror game. I\u2019d say this is more of an experience then a horror game. At least that is the way that it comes across to me.<br><br>I was very interested to see what kind of stuff would come up in this from what it\u2019s based on. The difficult thing with dreams and nightmares is you can show and tell someone what happened, but you can\u2019t always bring across the emotions, how you felt and the general tone and atmosphere of the dream for that very reason. An example being that I have a phobia (or Phonophobia to be more precise), an irrational fear, which I could try to explain to someone, but ultimately they\u2019ll never understand the real feeling of having this overwhelming fear for something even you know is absolutely ridiculous.<br><br>(This is where it gets personal, skip this section if you frankly couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.)<br>The one thing this game brought back from the back junk filed caverns of my brain was an experience I had. I would wake up (still dreaming) in my room, and the tiniest little detail would be out of place. Whatever was out of place would \u201cclue\u201d as to what phobia I had developed in that particular dream. If I didn\u2019t figure it out in time, I\u2019d be killed. By something relating to the phobia I had just developed. For example, an out of place poster on my wall that advertised Claustrophobia. I didn\u2019t recognise it in time, a TV turned on in my room and it showed rows upon rows of beds, pairs of which that were opposite each other would slowly move toward another, then slam together face to face. Crushing the people inside. Starting from the furthest away and working its way to me I had to force myself to \u201cwake up\u201d. Only to wake up in my room again, a new slightly different oddity in my room, a new clue and a new phobia. <br>This happened what felt like hundreds of times. Safe to say when I finally woke up for real I was sat on my bed examining my room for something out of place like a true maniac. That experience being what this game reminded me of. It\u2019s not the exact same, but it definitely rang a few bells.<br><br>I am beyond a pansy when it comes to scary games and I was able to play this without stopping, hiding behind something and absolutely dreading moving forward like I have with traditional horror games. It\u2019s gory, but it\u2019s not particularly scary. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this game builds tension and suspense and really had me and my heart rate going at times, but I don\u2019t play many horrors games because of how big of a baby I am. If it couldn\u2019t get my of all people\u2019s jimmies truly rustling, I doubt it will for you.<br><br>Gameplay wise, you walk, you avoid and you run. There isn\u2019t much to it, but where it lacks in gameplay it makes up in other aspects. The art style and use of colour is wonderful. Things that are coloured can be interacted with. A lot of things you can interest I was honestly curious as to what the significance of. Maybe they are just there for curiosities sake? Some are items you can use but most are just little things in the scene to get a closer look. <br><br>The settings are interesting and at times almost labyrinth like. I was torn between feeling like it was linear and I was on the right path and feeling like I was going in circles and was completely lost. It definitely added to the game. Wasn\u2019t at all frustrating for me. <br><br>Finally, story. I\u2019m not sure I would go as far as saying there is a story given the nature of nightmares. But you can tell there is definitely a recurring theme. Which is interesting! Made me wonder. This is definitely one of those games I would actually be interested in hearing the developer talk about. <br><br>All in all (thank god it\u2019s over, right?) this is a great little indie game. I enjoyed it!<br>It\u2019s an interesting experience and it\u2019s a pretty easy 100% which is always a nice bonus!<br><br><br>TL;DR : (Don\u2019t blame you) You walk a lot and gameplay wise you don\u2019t do much. But it makes up with that with a wonderful art style and an interesting theme\/story. It\u2019s an easy 100% and I think it\u2019s definitely worth a try. Especially if you like this psychology hoop-la, like I do!<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14799922', 'summary' );

This mysterious story of a troubled young protagonist shows a deep connection between him and his sister, and yet he seems to be so alone, so isolated in this nightmare realm. <br><br>The effects of prolonged solitude and isolation from the rest of the world can bring about these strange and hard to manage feelings of anxiety or OCD, and it creates a feeling of fear and distrust towards the few humans that are close to the inflicted. We see this fear in the protagonist and his close relationship with his sister as his visions slowly distort the image of this caring force in his life into someone who doesn't even recognize who he is.<br><br>The title screen alone gives a foreboding and chilling effect as the eerie sounding notes of a piano descend peculiarly in the same way the player will descend into progressively bizarre and terrifying realms of what seems to be the characters own mind. Deeper into the hauntings of your nightmares you will journey, waking up over and over again only to find yourself in an even more terrifying nightmare than the last like some kind of harrowing metaphor for the day-to-day dealings of those who suffer from mental health issues.<br><br>With each passing of these horrible nights that seem to be a dream or vision our protagonist awakens back in his bed suddenly, gasping for air and trying to put together the pieces of what he saw. Each time you awaken startled out from your slumber your environments change and the place you once called home slowly evolves into something hellish and terrifying. More and more with each damning vision your surroundings become enshrouded with antique oddities and bizzare, grotesque imagery.<br><br>I'm not the biggest fan of horror, not because I get scared easily but because blood and gore never really do it for me. I was kinda exposed to a lot of violent entertainment as a kid unfortunately and saw a lot of thriller and slasher flicks and such at probably too early an age.  I became totally desensitized to shock values in horror. <br><br>This game, though.. This effects me in ways I can't really explain, and wouldn't feel comfortable explaining because it really hits home with issues I've had dealing with insomnia and anxiety at a younger age although clearly not as extreme as what the developer, who states that his own real life experiences were a huge influence on the game, has been through. The point, either way, seems to be that mental health, no matter how small or severe, is a real issue that needs to be looked at more seriously especially in the gaming world.<br><br>Despite the very sparse dialogue the characters are given incredible authentic personality through the emotions they portray throughout the game. The sound design is the best I've heard in a horror game and recommends you use headphones, I can see exactly why and would absolutely recommend it now as well. The effects all come at you from every direction and make you feel like footsteps accompanied by the rattling of chains are closing in behind and faint whispering can be heard as you step deeper into dark basements, the atmosphere is so thick and heavy that I find myself stopping to catch my breath and gather my thoughts.<br><br>Still, after a couple playthroughs and seeing half of the endings I am left with so many question on what exactly our main character is going through. What causes him to see some of these visions, particularly of the cruel happenings between him and his sister?

Along the headphone, using a controller will help expand the experience with the rumble motors. Using headphones and a controller i had a amazing experience with this unique horror game. Throughout playing this game, I was unnerved by the creepy atmosphere the visuals and sound give help off. Although this game has such an amazing atmosphere throughout it , i did find myself getting bored with the game. It could use more puzzles or some kind of different game elements. Along with being a bit slow the puzzles are not very hard. Even though there is same pacing issue, I had zero issues when it came to any bugs. The atmosphere the game creates can hard to explain, but it is one of the stand out features for this game. <br>   <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros              <\/div>   <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   \n    <li>Amazing Atmosphere <br>    <\/li><li>Intriguing Story <br>    <\/li><li>Neat art style <br>    <\/li><li>Unique experience <br>    <\/li><li>It really gives you that creepy feeling  <\/li><\/ul>   <br>   <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Cons             <\/div>   <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   \n    <li>Can get repetitive <br>    <\/li><li>Could use more content <br>    <\/li><li>The few puzzles are not hard <br>   <\/li><\/ul>   <br>   <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">  Conclusion                <\/div>  <br>  <br>                Neverending Nightmare is an artistic look at the horror genre.

I wouldn't say go buy this game right now, but to wait for it to go on sale. <br>   <br>-HiPFiRED <br><br><br><i> If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i><br><br><i>Check out the Original Network Groups.

I have been exposed to the game much longer than most people probably will. <br><br>So obviously, you know that it\u2019s a horror game, but not in the same way Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast, Slender, or SCP Containment Breach are. Those use a first person perspective to create more personal jump scares and to create a more realistic atmosphere; Neverending Nightmares doesn\u2019t have nearly as many jump scares as those do and focuses on enhancing a very foreboding atmosphere and telling a story. Neverending Nightmares has a lot more in common with Gone Home then the other titles mentioned.<br><br>The story in NN can easily get confusing and requires some analysis to fully understand. Depending on which ending you get, you may be greatly disappointed in the game. I feel like only one of the endings actually has closure while the other two are much better if experienced after the first ending. The game tries to push the player to the first ending, but there is one branch that I feel could have been done much better in pushing the player in the right direction (SPOILER: it\u2019s at the end of the asylum level. I feel like most people will probably jump off the edge just to see what happens, even if there\u2019s a teetering animation. This is problematic because the way to the first ending is by going back into the asylum).<br><br>The horror in NN mostly comes from the atmosphere and imagery; not too much from the feeling of being chased or stalked like in SCP or, Slender. If you want something like those games then you\u2019ll probably be somewhat disappointed with NN. Not to say that NN doesn\u2019t have jump scares but they\u2019re placed throughout the game very sparingly like in Amnesia, or Silent Hill. Silent Hill is somewhat similar to NN, but Silent Hill had more of a puzzle focus than NN does. The puzzles in NN are pretty easy and even become easier if you can\u2019t seem to figure it out (note, that these \u201chints\u201d are designed not to break your immersion, so there will be no word box that appears; rather, something in the environment will change to lead you in the right direction). If you expect the cryptic puzzles found in Silent Hill, then you\u2019ll probably be disappointed.<br><br>From my interactions with Matt Gilgenbach, the creative director, and my many playthroughs of the game, I figured that immersion is probably the biggest priority in this game. Many things that are just looked over in other games have a reason for it to happen; for example, every time the player dies, he wakes up in a bed as if that death was just a nightmare. Other games would probably just throw a \u201cgame over\u201d screen and have you try again\u2014and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but NN creates a narrative reason to player deaths, which boosts immersion. Immersion also works well with the way the game tells its story since attention to the game environments is expected to fully understand many of the details in the story. I feel like the game\u2019s short length also encourages replays since it\u2019s a lot easier to study the environments of a two-hour game than a twenty-hour one. <br><br>So in conclusion, for what it is, NN is a great experience that I would recommend it to anyone who likes disturbing horror with a thought-out story, and a very distinctive art style. The game isn't really going to make you scream like other horror games, the game will give you more of an uncomfortable feeling while playing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to people who generally don\u2019t like\/are getting sick of games that don\u2019t have too many gameplay features, ie games that tend to be \u201cartsy\u201d like Gone Home, and Journey.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12247531', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12247531' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12247531\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12247531' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12247531\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12247531', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12247531_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12247531_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t65 of 86 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11875523\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yukimurapanda\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"148684073\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/66\/660fb58e05fdf0a99d80f00fc100ba210a306f3c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/66\/660fb58e05fdf0a99d80f00fc100ba210a306f3c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/66\/660fb58e05fdf0a99d80f00fc100ba210a306f3c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yukimurapanda\/\" data-miniprofile=\"148684073\">yukimurapanda<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yukimurapanda\/games\/?tab=all\">20 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yukimurapanda\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yukimurapanda\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Neverending Nightmares on August 26, 2014, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 26, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've played both the demo and the first chunk of the beta release, and I am SO excited for the official release! Completely original in both concept and graphic design, and not only are the controls smooth but every aspect about the gameplay itself is extremely intriguing. Neverending Nightmares is very successful in delivering psychological unease visually and through atmospheric ambience, just like pixel horror games such as &quot;Mad Father&quot; and &quot;Witch's House&quot; were able to do. Would definitely recommend this game who likes more psychological horror and an interesting yet somewhat cryptic plotline over blatant jumpscares and chases in the more &quot;traditional&quot; horror games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11875523', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11875523' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11875523\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11875523' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11875523\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11875523', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11875523_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11875523_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11939932\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JPrice321\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"75545585\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/59\/5947595b18f36f08b3a45a3626ccc1d66abad8de.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/59\/5947595b18f36f08b3a45a3626ccc1d66abad8de.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/59\/5947595b18f36f08b3a45a3626ccc1d66abad8de_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JPrice321\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75545585\">JPrice<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JPrice321\/games\/?tab=all\">347 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JPrice321\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JPrice321\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Neverending Nightmares on September 20, 2014, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 31, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: I took part in the Kickstarter campaign in order to get this game funded. As a result I\u2019ve been playing the game for a good number of months in its Alpha\/Beta stages, giving feedback and talking with the developers about the game.<br><br>-TL;DR version-<br>The game is a wonderfully crafted psychological horror game that builds its horror around crafting a dark and foreboding atmosphere. It also does a great job at emphasising a slower, more disturbing tone than a traditional startling tone. The game being inspired by the visions and thoughts of someone with mental illness give a very genuine and unnerving feel to everything, which as a result makes for one of the best horror games that I\u2019ve played in recent times. Definitely worth your time if you\u2019re a horror fan and want something that\u2019ll truly get under your skin.<br><br>-Long version-<br>Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game based upon the intrusive thoughts that have plagued developer Matt Gilgenbach over the years as a result of his mental illness. You play as Thomas, a man who initially when the game begins wakes up from a nightmare. From then on the game is shaped around Thomas\u2019 descent into his mind as he keeps waking up into new nightmares. One major factor is consistent throughout almost all of Thomas\u2019 nightmares, the presence of a girl named Gabby. How she and Thomas are connected remains unclear until one of the games multiple endings. As a result the player is given multiple possible theories to play around and work with; is she your sister? Is she your wife? Is she just a friend? Is she an enemy? The narrative gives the player enough to work with so that they are constantly guessing up until the very end of the game. This constant questioning plays into the world of Neverending Nightmares as you are never certain of what is reality or what is simply a figment of the nightmare you are currently in. As explained earlier the game features multiple branching pathways that lead to multiple endings (3 in total). These branches change the story of the game in various unique ways making the entire motivation behind the nightmares different in each ending, as a result it is encouraged that you playthrough multiple times to acquire all the endings and experience new nightmares that can only be found on that pathway. This added replayability should give you around an hour or two extra playtime once your first playthrough is completed.<br> <br>The gameplay of Neverending Nightmares follows a 2D adventure format. You walk around various environments, interact with objects and explore your current nightmare in order to progress forward. If there\u2019s one shortcoming that can be levelled against the game it\u2019s that the gameplay itself, on an objective level, is rather basic. The formula doesn\u2019t change too drastically from nightmare to nightmare, with only some minor puzzle solving elements being introduced when dealing with enemies. However there\u2019s enough story and horror to help strengthen the gameplay, making you intrigued to progress further. In terms of actual control Neverending Nightmares adopts a very simple control style, with the only major functions being move, interact and sprint. This simplicity however doesn\u2019t detract from the overall product in a major way.  The controls themselves are spot on, with the player being able to move Thomas in any which way they please, as well as being fully re-bindable. The controls also play into the horror as Thomas suffers from asthma, so he can only sprint for a short distance which requires effective management so the player isn\u2019t left in a compromising situation. There are also other sections that play with the controls in interesting ways, however you shall have to find those out for yourself.<br><br>But what\u2019s a horror game without the horror right? Well you\u2019ll find your needs met with Neverending Nightmares. As this is a semi-autobiographical product a lot of the horror has been drawn from real experiences and visions, which really adds to the game's atmosphere. Some of the visions and imagery you experience in Neverending Nightmares is truly disturbing, especially with the added context of it being taken from a very real place. From body mutilation to overwhelming darkness, there are multiple instances where you will be truly afraid or horrified of what may or may not be around the next turn. Often times you\u2019ll find yourself simply walking down a hallway, however the game slowly begins to twist and bend the environment to play with you. Distant whispers, growls within the darkness, words written in blood are simply some of the tactics that start to put you on edge. From there everything only builds and continues to build, making the player wonder \u201cWhen is something going to attack me?\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the next safe spot?\u201d \u201cWhat will happen if I go down these stairs?\u201d. Often times you will have never even seen an enemy that could potentially kill you and you\u2019re still on edge, just waiting\u2026Waiting for the inevitable. All of this contributes into creating a horror game that understands that the best way to create fear is to let the player scare themselves. However for those who like and appreciate the more startling aspects to horror, there are still elements of that in here with some well crafted jumpscares that are never too abundant to become tiresome.<br><br>One aspect of the game that can be critiqued is the brevity and challenge of the game. Neverending Nightmares isn\u2019t the most challenging of horror games. Often times you are able to bypass enemies with relative ease once you determine their behaviour and the game is decidely linear which leads little room to get lost. As a result the game in one playthrough can be finished in around 2-3 hours, however with the added branches there is an extra hour or two of gameplay added on top. With that said, the game is much more focused on the experience than challenge. By focusing more on the experience, the team at Infinitap Games are able to create a very lean game that packs all of horror into one sleek package. As a result the horror itself is a lot more impactful rather than being bogged down by repetition or filler. How you feel on the matter however is something that should be left up to you, just be aware that the game isn\u2019t particularly lengthy or challenging before going in. <br><br>Finally the visual\/audio design is superb throughout. The Edward Gorey inspired art design stands out as being something unique within the genre, it also creates a storybook-esque style that meshes well with the horrific atmosphere. The audio design is top notch with subtle flourishes of music and ambient noises that play on your mind all throughout the game. Voice acting, whilst being slightly underplayed in the story as a whole, conveys the suitable amount of emotion required to make you empathise with Thomas\u2019 struggle and dubious of Gabby\u2019s true intentions.<br><br>All in all I can say that the money I spent on Kickstarting this game was not made in vain. Neverending Nightmares succeeds at crafting a satisfying horror experience that toys with the player in a wonderfully fresh way. The semi-autobiographical angle gives the whole game a very grounded and real atmosphere, making you see some of the worst that mental illness does to people.<br><br>In my opinion, it\u2019s one of my favourite horror games in recent memory and definitely worth a purchase for any horror fan.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11939932', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11939932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11939932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11939932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11939932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11939932', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11939932_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11939932_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15760245\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/aurumlamina\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48828234\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32a284a125d8a340b60d983902f2eec6ed550aaa.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32a284a125d8a340b60d983902f2eec6ed550aaa.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32a284a125d8a340b60d983902f2eec6ed550aaa_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/aurumlamina\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48828234\">Aurumlamina<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/aurumlamina\/games\/?tab=all\">1,255 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/aurumlamina\/recommended\/\">104 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/aurumlamina\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 9, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you're looking for a short, atmospheric, and creepy horror game, Neverending Nightmares will scratch that itch for you.  Each nightmare that you experience leads into the next, slowly revealing the reason that you're there in the first place.  To get the full effect of the game, it's recommended that you play with a headset and a controller as the ambient sound and rumble features are implemented.<br><br>The game is short, I completed it in about an hour and a half.  There are three separate endings that you can unlock based on a few of the choices in the second half of the game.  I was unaware that I was even making choices on my playthrough as they are not obvious until they are revealed at the end.<br><br>All in all, this is a good game and a fun experience.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys atmospheric horror with an unfolding mystery added in that explains why it's all happening.  I must say that I personally would recommend only picking it up on a sale, though, as the current $15 price tag is a bit steep for what is offered.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15760245', 'summary' );

I have always thought the 2D hand-drawn style that this game adds such a spooky element. <br>Unique and nostalgic. It reminded me of the scary children's books that I used to read as a kid.<br>The game doesn't rely too much on cheap jump scares, but rather sets up an errie atmosphere through the music and setting. Although it can be repetitive at some times, the overall creepiness of the game keeps your heart pounding.<br><br>Cons: It should cost $4.99, $9.99 MAX. $15 is pretty steep. <br>The player moves very slow while moving up and down the stairs, which tested my patience. There are some rooms that are pointless to enter and only waste time.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend this game. Play it with a friend, It gives a good scare.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30596326', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30596326' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30596326\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30596326' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30596326\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30596326', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30596326_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30596326_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29786949\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198076639264\/recommended\/253330\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"116373536\">[GMS] VanDam<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1.
