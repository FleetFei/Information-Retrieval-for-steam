It looks similar to gravity puzzler The Bridge at first glance. But with the instant gravity flips of And Yet It Moves, several unique game mechanics and a mature and tightly interwoven story, the game is a fresh experience that is well worth playing.<br><br>The protagonist of the game is a young man whose life is suddenly shattered when he is diagnosed with lung cancer. We follow him as he learns to accept his fate, in a game where story is told in smooth transitions between playable cutscenes and puzzle chapters. The five main chapters of the game are inspired by the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.<br><br>Each chapter introduces a new game element, themed after the stage it represents. The symbolism isn't necessarily clear-cut, like in the denial chapter, where darkness chases you from one or two sides of the screen, and can only be held off by facing it. This obstacle makes sense though, and is explained in the story segment leading up to it. Anger is more easily grasped, since it's represented by red pulsating, and sometimes moving, orbs that kill on touch. Bargaining has levels where you simultaneously control a mirrored shadow protagonist, and in depression you have to move through scarce sources of light to avoid the deadly darkness. The final chapter is more of a narrative device, and is one I choose not to describe to avoid spoiling the experience.<br><br>In addition to the five main chapters, there's also a tutorial, which is designed to make you comfortable with the gravity flip mechanics. Like the first four of the five main chapters, the tutorial contains 12 levels, of which nine are required to unlock the next chapter. The first nine levels in each chapter are for the most part easy enough to figure out for someone with a bit of experience with the genre, but getting the timing right can be tricky in some of the levels. None of the levels have checkpoints, so if you mess up and die, you will have to start over from the beginning of the level.<br><br>Getting through the game took me just over three hours, but solving the additional 15 harder levels doubled that, so the game should offer about six hours worth of gameplay in total. If you go after the hidden glimmers of hope or a no-death run, you can probably add several more hours on top of that. The game never gets as punishing as The Bridge or Closure, but if you've made it through Braid and LIMBO, you should be able to solve most of the levels of In Between without too much trouble.<br><br>This is a game well worth playing for the story alone. The subjects of grief and regret are topics I haven't seen explored in games often enough, and seldom as intimately as in this game. We get to witness the protagonist's struggles with accepting his imminent death, memories of his childhood and his troublesome relationship to his father, and having to leave a young daughter behind. Most of the story is told through playable cutscenes and in spoken thought leading in to levels, but some levels also have memory shards hidden as cracks in the wall that trigger when you walk past them.<br><br>The game is fully playable with my wired Xbox 360 controller, though I prefer to play it using the keyboard. It's controlled using both sticks on a gamepad or WASD and arrow keys with keyboard controls. There are no options for rebinding keys, but I found these defaults intuitive and easy to play with. I haven't experienced any technical issues with the Linux version, but the demo on Steam is available for Linux, so you can try it to see if it works well on your system.<br><br><b>NOTE:<\/b> This review was originally posted on <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.gamingonlinux.com\/articles\/puzzle-platformer-in-between-released-on-steam-for-linux-has-a-demo.5870\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >GamingOnLinux<\/a>.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17749909', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17749909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17749909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17749909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17749909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17749909', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17749909_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17749909_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18423378\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LATEXXJUGGERNUT\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"87350247\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1c\/1c755152b62a28a55f3ae7ecfbb09d27eff4b63f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1c\/1c755152b62a28a55f3ae7ecfbb09d27eff4b63f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1c\/1c755152b62a28a55f3ae7ecfbb09d27eff4b63f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LATEXXJUGGERNUT\/\" data-miniprofile=\"87350247\">LATEXXJUGGERNUT<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LATEXXJUGGERNUT\/games\/?tab=all\">50 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LATEXXJUGGERNUT\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/LATEXXJUGGERNUT\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSaw this game being examined by Extra Credits, and had to experience it for myself.  Much detail was put into this game, but there were a few design choices that seemed lacking.<br><br>When I look at a level menu I expect 3 things usually associated with icons and\/or a text blurb:<br>1) The Name of the Level.<br>2) Has the player reached the endpoint?<br>3) Has the player found the all the secrets?<br><br>However what I got was:<br>1) A layout of the map to memorize<br>2) A filled inner circle once the player reached level endpoint<br>3) A half circle to indicate if a memory was present in the level<br><br>While it was does contain the basic information, it is impossible to tell someone about a level by describing a map.  The levels aren't numbered, just nodes of circles along the bottom of each section to choose from.  The issue is I can't describe the unique map within a reasonable time frame, and describing a node means nothing to another player since they all look the same.<br><br>The next issue is lack of objective information.  If I had never looked at the achievements, I never would've known about the &quot;Hidden Glimmers of Hope&quot; with one hidden inside a level within each section.  Also there's no indication of which level contains a glimmer nor the specified rules you must abide by in order to obtain it.  If it's hidden, leave hints.<br><br>Lastly, if you are making an achievement for doing all the levels &quot;perfectly&quot;, you need to display to the player which levels are done &quot;perfectly&quot;.  Re-doing levels because the player isn't shown they obtained something does not result in replayability (fun) as much as frustration.  The feeling of progress is done if everything appears done.<br><br>With that out of the way, I only have two suggestions for the developers.<br><br>1.  QuickSave - not checkpoints, just being able to save at any certain safe point allows faster iterations which means less frustration.  Not every game can benefit from saving whenever, but this certainly would've.<br><br>2.  Difficulty Tweaking - You know what I'm talking about, those extra spikes, the movement speed of darkness and orbs, orb speed scaling bigger\/smaller, certain placement\/existance of spike balls.  Making a game easier doesn't make the story less appealing.  It is true players have different meanings of &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;satisfaction&quot;, but if they aren't being satisfied on lower difficulties, they'll raise the difficulty, you could even have an achievement as an incentive for them to challenge themselves.  As for the obvious &quot;It's too hard&quot; players, you could have a secret death counter, and if they die over and over again in quick succession, prompt them about lowering the difficulty.  Rayman Legends used this similar system, but the impact it had was minor due to the levels still remaining the same instead of making the level with less deathtraps.....<br><br>In fact, let the end users set when they want to be notified if it's too hard.  They choose how much death should lead to their acceptance of lowering the difficulty.<br><br>Overall, it is a well made game and other developers could learn a thing or two from it, both in regards of what to do and possibly what not to do (though I found what this team did, did it right.).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18423378', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18423378' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18423378\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18423378' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18423378\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18423378', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18423378_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18423378_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17653014\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">foofaraw<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/games\/?tab=all\">1,134 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/\">102 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 21, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThough &quot;In Between&quot; has been on my Wish List for some time, I chose to play the demo before committing. But I only played it for about three minutes. The quality of art, the story and the game play are so readily apparent that the choice was simple. Admittedly, I've played less than an hour, so this review will likey not be my final version.<br><br>A contemporary, urban male is facing a rapidly approaching death, and must prepare emotionally and mentally. This is done through a series of puzzles involving (superficially) gravity. (I say superficially, because even at early levels &quot;In Between&quot; offers much more, as well as great potential.) A friend looking at the Store Page was immediately repulsed by characteristics seemingly shared by platformers. I have to disagree. It doesn't call itself a platformer, and had it been a platformer I would have quite possibly expressed the same distain. No, &quot;In Between&quot; is a story driven puzzle game. A good one. And the puzzles can be quite difficult (in a good way.)<br><br>There is a world of gravity-based games available. &quot;In Between&quot; shares characteristics with &quot;The Bridge&quot;, but has far more story. Actually, the gravity puzzle aspect is quite similar to &quot;Gravity Error&quot;, so liking either is a strong indication of a players feeling about the other. But the gravity aspect is just a stepping stone to qualities that the excellent learning curve has just begun to reveal to this player, so I have nothing more to say at this time.<br><br>Except - PLAY the demo!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17653014', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17653014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17653014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17653014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17653014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17653014', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17653014_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17653014_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26397798\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">UN0W3N<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/games\/?tab=all\">2,692 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/\">229 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received In Between for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>In Between is developed by Gentlymad and published by Headup Games. It was quite the train trip, metaphorically speaking. Took me a while to review it since \u201chappiness\u201d isn\u2019t on this game\u2019s shortlist of emotions it expresses.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>It is not a story without hope. I played games that were truly nihilistic, but In Between walks a thin line from which it never derails. I\u2019m not going to talk of the plotline a lot but to give you an impression, once our protagonist discovers that he is terminally ill, life itself and his thoughts take on a new meaning. What really drew me to this title, is the rarity it exhibits. A story driven puzzle-platformer that can bring a tear to most players is not common at all. From a gameplay perspective, we have 60 levels structured into several chapters, each of them an allegory to the K\u00fcbler-Ross model. Known colloquially as the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance). Not an easy theme to digest which is exactly why I believe this game is not for everyone. And this is not an elitist interpretation, merely an observation. A large percentage of gamers desire direct means of entertainment. An even more in-depth explanation would be that comedies will always be more popular than tragedies. It is ultimately up to you to decide. <br><br>While certain levels do require some trial &amp; error, the graphical and sound assets provide a smooth experience. Voice acting, a feature that is absent from a vast majority of platform games I played lately, is making a triumphant return and adds another fine layer over the storyline. The 2D sprites, especially those within the dream sequences, are very detailed and offer substantial insight upon the protagonist\u2019s happier moments in life. A game with very few flaws and no technical issues.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Emotional story<br>+ Mix of puzzle and platforming sections<br>+ Steam Achievements &amp; Trading Cards<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- Unbalanced difficulty<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Result \/ Final thoughts<\/div>After playing for the last few months quite a few 2D platformers, I thought I\u2019d seen everything this genre has to offer on Steam. In Between proved me wrong and even though I had a certain degree of anxiety while playing it, I don\u2019t regret giving it a chance to unravel its tragic tale. It is a break from conformity and I appreciate it for that reason alone.<br><br><b>Rating 8\/10<\/b><br> <br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/elitegives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Elite Giveaways<\/a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.<\/blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26397798', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26397798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26397798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26397798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26397798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26397798', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26397798_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26397798_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17982237\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994086084\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"33820356\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1a\/1a0405b06035256723217ce3ddf73156b69f9f03.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1a\/1a0405b06035256723217ce3ddf73156b69f9f03.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1a\/1a0405b06035256723217ce3ddf73156b69f9f03_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994086084\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33820356\">Goukiband<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994086084\/games\/?tab=all\">483 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994086084\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197994086084\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn Between is not always a fun game. It's an interesting game, really interesting, full of moments that get your mind working, pulling themes in to the gameplay. It's an aspect of the game that brings to mind Braid, too few games find or even try to find a way to let their narrative affect their gameplay. <br><br>It\u2019s maybe underselling things a little bit, but In Between is a puzzle platformer, you have to get from the start point to the level's exit. To do that you have to flip gravity, walking on the ceiling, flinging yourself from one wall to another. The difficulty comes in what's put in your way, be that spikes, blocks, or environmental effects, which is where the narrative comes in. <br><br>In Between deals with terminal cancer, or at least deals with dealing with terminal cancer. You're essentially playing through someone coming to terms with their fate, their mortality. Each set of levels is themed around one of the 5 stages of grief. Without wanting to spoil too much, 'denial' sees you avoiding a closing darkness, kind of like a Mario level that's constantly pushing you forward. The developers have found reasons for introducing mechanics to the levels, you're soon encouraged to face down the darkness, push it back, and depending on your perspective, either face or push back the truth. <br><br>Which brings me to 'anger'. In anger you have to make your way across the winding levels, altering gravity, while avoiding giant red balls of anger. It's at this point I noticed the game starting to become a bit more ruthless with its difficulty. You'd solve the puzzle of the level, work out how to traverse its obstacles, only to die on a spike placed a pixel away from your safe landing zone. It's not that the other levels aren't difficult, but 'anger' feels needless, almost cruel. I've started to wonder if it's deliberate, if it's recreating the feelings you would experience when going through that stage, why's it happening to you, it's unfair, it's cruel. <br><br>Or I'm over thinking things. <br><br>Either way it's a dangerous game for In Between to play. There's a lot of points where In Between just isn't that fun, where the more frustrating parts of the game drag it down. You don't always get enough time to properly see the task in front of you, meaning it takes repeated attempts to even start to figure out what's being asked of you, often having to redo difficult sections just to get the opportunity. It's why falling to a simple spike is such a killer, and why, despite knowing what the game would lose I did start to pine for a checkpoint or two. <br><br>There's nice touches, or 'nice' touches, where when you die the background of the level cracks, showing what's behind, as though it's you scarring, your defences cracking, or the truth breaking through. The story can be very affecting, small instances, ideas it brings forward, not just a man facing death. It can also be a little maudlin, and the script heavy handed. While the narration performance isn't bad by any means, the choice of making it gravely does make it sound a little teenage comic book at points. <br><br>What In Between deserves credit for is the wealth of ideas it brings to the table. No two levels are the same, mechanics are tossed away before they're overused, and the 5 concepts evolve over their levels. It's got striking looks, a good soundtrack, and well handled cut scenes. And if you do get too stuck, it gives you enough leeway to skip a few levels and still make progress <br><br>Ultimately, despite some misgivings I'd still recommend In Between. It's certainly got enough challenge for puzzle fans, but at the same time its themes and how it ties them to its gameplay makes it incredibly interesting for those looking for something different. It's a rare thing.

Neither am I a fan of puzzle games. This game though. <i>In Between<\/i> somehow managed to catch my attention and even slip into my wishlist. Glad that I gave this game a chance, I was definitely missing out on some interesting experience. Keep it mind that I'm nowhere near the end of this game but here are my thoughts about it so far.<br><br><b><div class=\"bb_h1\">======OVERVIEW======<\/div><\/b><br><br>First thing that actually made me notice this game is the beautiful art-style. The fact that it's hand painted is impressive as well, not gonna lie. It's been some time I've been this mind-blown by visual side of a game. It works perfectly with the whole theme and atmosphere. Accompanied by awesome soundtrack, it's a pleasure to play this game. A very interesting experience. <br>Even though this game can be boring every now and then when you're stuck at some puzzle, it's definitely worth to keep playing. If you feel burnt out, just give it some time to think about the puzzles and then come back to it. About the story, I must say that I love those &quot;mind images&quot; popping in levels. Other than that only segments between &quot;chapters&quot; and voice-overs during level can bring you some insights into story. Nevertheless, I'm not really far enough to say anything about the story but so far, I love the progress it makes. Plus those all are good features that can slow down &quot;the burn out&quot; process. Other than that, I don't really have that much to say about the game. Try the demo if you're not really convinced to buy this game and see for yourself. <br><br><b><div class=\"bb_h1\">PROS<\/div>- BEAUTIFUL hand made art-style<br>- controls\/gameplay<br>- trading cards + achievements<br>- soundtrack<br>- variety of challenging obstacles\/levels<br>- atmosphere<br>- free demo for you to try<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">CONS<\/div>- &quot;the burn out&quot; level is high <i>(I guess that's the thing about almost every platformer though)<\/i><br>- price tag<\/b><br><br><b><div class=\"bb_h1\">======RATING======<\/div><\/b><br>Even if you're not really into puzzles and platformers, this game can bring you some interesting experience. If you love platformers though and you don't own this game yet, I wonder why since I think this game is one of the best indie platformers made. It seems to be a long game as well, so that might be another reason for you to buy it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_code\">For recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/LotsOGiveaways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Lot's O Giveaway's<\/a> group curations <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/LotsOGiveaways#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a>!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21337852', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21337852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21337852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21337852' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21337852\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21337852', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21337852_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21337852_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17693387\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/theoldnotsowiseguy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"1312015\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b908f0be16c88d865388038ef17e753f1f06dd87.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b908f0be16c88d865388038ef17e753f1f06dd87.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b908f0be16c88d865388038ef17e753f1f06dd87_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/theoldnotsowiseguy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"1312015\">Scytharia.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/theoldnotsowiseguy\/games\/?tab=all\">1,328 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/theoldnotsowiseguy\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/theoldnotsowiseguy\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSorry for my bad english, german review may to follow<br><br>tl;dr: Check the pros &amp; cons below and don't forget to try the demo \\o\/<br><br><br>Okay, after &quot;wasting&quot; 7 hours ingame already (well, I am a slow player+REALLY bad at puzzle games), I think I can come to a semi-conclusion already, even tho I am only half way through the game. Yes I am really bad at puzzlegames.<br><br>So, what is &quot;In Between&quot;? Another &quot;usual&quot; indie puzzle platformer? No, I wouldn't agree there. It sure is some sort of a puzzle game and tho you have to be precise often, I wouldn't call it a platformer per se. So what is it then? Difficult to say really. I guess, I would call it a mix of &quot;And yet it moves&quot;, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, a liiiiiiiiittle tad &quot;Braid&quot; and &quot;A walk in the dark&quot; (at least the levels you play with the girl). That said, In Between sure is no cheap copy of those mentioned games. In fact I think it's an utterly beautiful game so far. Literally it is. I really dig the artstyle. Much love to details, very charming - kind of interactive - cutscenes &amp; beautiful backgrounds. Tho the levels so far look pretty much the same on the first look, you'll notice, that there are lots of details. (e.g. the background shatters a little around the area you failed at. Pretty neat little detail.). To keep a long story short: The game looks very charming &amp; beautiful.<br><br>But as we know, a good looker often fails to deliver gameplay\/story. In Between does not fail there. Pretty much the opposite is the case. (To be honest I didn't really expect a story at all). The gameplay so far is very solid, fun and later ingame also pretty challenging. Also it doesn't get boring as the game seems to introduce a new gameplay mechanic with every new chapter (at least so far!). And even tho I failed a lot already, it never got frustrating. With every single fail I did learn something new. And to be fair, it always was my fault. The game never came up with any unfair bs so far. Yes, sometimes I raged a bit, especially when I - once again - failed just an inch before the level exit. But I never had an alt+f4 moment yet. Still I would have appreciated an optional cp system in the game even tho you CAN actually skip the last 2-3 levels of a set if you get stuck. So no one really should have to struggle to experience the quite nice story.<br><br>I really don't want to spoil the story here but so far I am actually surprised how well it was put into the game (excellent for an indie game imo). It's nothing new tbh but it's well put together. You will get piece by piece throughout the playthrough. Sometimes in beautifully drawn cutscenes, sometimes in the levels via e.g. memories you can reveal.<br><br>The narrators (both english &amp; german) sound really good &amp; you always hope for more to come. It really keeps you going for the story, not only the gameplay. I was pretty much stunned at first because I sure didn't expect there to be a narrator at all. Also the background music &amp; sound effects is\/are pretty good. Mostly soothing &amp; calming, never pushing or annoying.<br><br>Last but not least, I think &quot;In Between&quot; is a really beautiful piece of art, without forgetting to deliver fun, varying, challenging gameplay and a well put together story throughout about 60?! levels. Game runs smooth and as it is for me, I didn't encounter any bugs so far. If you're on the edge, feel free to try the demo and see if the game is for you. o\/<br><br><br><br>Phew, okay, that sure was a wall of text so I guess, I'll just add the usual pro\/cons now:<br><br><br>+ beautiful artstyle\/gfx and lots of love for details.<br><br>+ interesting, fun &amp; later on challenging gameplay<br><br>+ well thought out level design<br><br>+ really good sounding narrator(s)<br><br>+ nice background music &amp; overall good sound design<br><br>+ a nice told story which fits in very well &amp; keeps you going<br><br>+ smooth controls (XBox 360 controller at least) <br><br>+ about 60 levels (can't say anything about hidden game modes or whatever)<br> <br>+ pretty much bug free (tho the devs stated, they found a few little ones)<br><br>+ smooth performance at any point<br><br><br>Couldn't find any negative things so far. As I mentioned above, maybe an optional cp system would have been nice at least for the later appearing challenging &amp; lengthy levels, but sure isn't necessary to go on with the game\/story. Most likely to edit the review, once I've finished the game. o\/\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17693387', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17693387' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17693387\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17693387' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17693387\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17693387', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17693387_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17693387_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25877341\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">26.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTerminal lung cancer isn\u2019t a theme that one would typically associate with a video game. Actually, it\u2019s a rather odd choice as it is not a topic that wouldn\u2019t be considered fun by any means. German indie developer Gently Mad has crafted a rather unique 2D story driven puzzle game about this difficult subject as they bring us their recently released game In Between, an emotional, stylish platformer about a cancer patient at the end of his journey.<br><br>In Between revolves around a young man coming to terms with his impending death. We first meet him in an interactive cutscene where he is very weak in a wheelchair and in palliative care. Playing through 60 platforming levels, you traverse through the man\u2019s alternate reality, as he reflects on his life remembering important moments from his past, and copes with the five stages of grief. These stages of grief add a unique touch to In Between, and it stands out from the typical platformer, adding a new game mechanic with each chapter. For example, the stages that represent denial adds an encroaching darkness that threatens to swallow the man alive, but recedes when he turns to face it. Anger on the other hand is represented as threatening, pulsating red orbs that are scattered throughout a level. <br><br>The game is a very emotional tale indeed. The plot unfolds by solving puzzles as you traverse through extremely challenging platforming levels using gravity defying movements. Using the right stick on the controller, you can move your character in four different directions, allowing him to walk on walls and the ceiling if need be, to avoid a variety of static and dynamic obstacles, such as rows of deadly spikes, and you can access moving blocks and switches as well.<br><br>Unfortunately, I felt the controls were not as responsive as they should have been at times, which led to some very frustrating moments. While I will note that the level design is very clever, the difficulty level of the platforming segments, and the precision needed to complete each level, really took away from some of my enjoyment of the game at times. There were times that I died repeatedly and other times where I almost finished a level after solving a puzzle and I would often meet an untimely death because of mistimed jump as a result of the control. <br><br>I found In Between a bit difficult and that I did not want to continue playing with issues like this, which is a shame because it\u2019s such a story driven game. To have it interrupted by constantly dying in these manners is a bit disappointing. And without a leaderboard, timed runs, unlocks or collectibles, there is very little replay value to be had. The levels, once played, are available in the menu to play through again, but to be perfectly honest, I had absolutely no desire to as there isn\u2019t any incentive. It\u2019s a tough game to play through, as not only does the gameplay leave you feeling extremely frustrated at times, but the theme itself, a young man dying of lung cancer, can be a bit challenging to deal with.<br><br>While characters and the interactive cutscenes are colourful and beautifully hand painted, the backgrounds seemed to be extremely dull, with drab hues of beige and brown. Perhaps this is due to the theme of death and the stages of grief, but the uninteresting backgrounds further added to my frustration with the game. The music was well suited for the experience, and the voice acting is quite exceptional with the dying man\u2019s narration adding to the heartbreak and the emotion of the story. <br><br>In Between offers a unique twist on the puzzle platforming genre, but the precision needed to complete each level, and the extreme difficulty, takes away from the enjoyment. It\u2019s an emotional story that deserves to be told and experienced by gamers, but perhaps not through the frustrating and challenging platforming levels that partially result from the control issues. Fans of extreme puzzle platformers may feel right at home, but others not as skilled in the genre may be left frustrated. At the end of the day Gently Mad should be commended for crafting a beautiful and emotional story, but given some of the weak points of the game it\u2019s hard to recommend it to everyone out there.

On one hand, we have puzzles with gravity control, changing gameplay within special levels, avoiding obstacles, planning your way strategically before running towards the end and many more (I don\u2019t want to spoil you too much :D). On the other hand, we have the story of the main character, struggling with his own thoughts on his way to the end of his life. (The narrator does, in my opinion, an amazing job, extra credit for him please! :)  ) Both of those aspects combined are what makes In Between a one of a kind game, or even an art project on it\u2019s own. That explains the awards that the guys from gentlymad won before the release of In Between, f.ex. the German Video Game Award for Best Concept 2015! <br><br>I highly recommend this game, for the amazing gameplay and the challenging puzzles, if you\u2019re a platformer fan, but even more for the plain experience of the story of In Between.

It's not so much that I don't like them, but developers that work in the genre these days ramp the difficulty levels up particularly early in the game. It's still very well designed (think a little bit of Braid and a lot of And Yet It Moves or The Bridge) and of course, the heartbreaker story. Worth your time if you're a serious business puzzle platformer fan.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30614283', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30614283' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30614283\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30614283' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30614283\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30614283', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30614283_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30614283_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30258187\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198201692917\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"241427189\">Atlas<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 12.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">In the end, I hope the good outweighs the bad.<\/div><br>Fair warning for spoilers and general bizarreness on my part.<br><br>&quot;I\u2019ll need a bit of time before I could write anything about it&quot; was my first thought when I saw the credits roll. I didn\u2019t know what to say, there were too many things I wanted to type out but too few I could actually tell in a succinct and organised manner.<br><br>Now it\u2019s been long enough, and for once I\u2019m at peace with the fact that I don\u2019t feel like a game review should to be succinct and organised because it wouldn\u2019t make sense for this game.<br><br>Difficult gameplay, usual platformer, brilliant art style, you get all that from screenshots. But that\u2019s not it, the game itself doesn\u2019t work when it\u2019s dissected and laid out on the table like that, because that way you feel like you know what you\u2019re getting. And in this case you don\u2019t. <br><br>Personally, I\u2019m never fond of platformers of any kind and often don\u2019t have the patience for muscle memory keyboarding gameplay. Like a lot of games, this game has both. Unlike a lot of games, the levels and mechanics made sense and most importantly they were able to support the already strong narratives and the story itself. Even the level of difficulty for each chapter made sense. Even the placement of every spike and shadow and burning anger made sense. It was the integrity of all of the in-game elements and how well they\u2019re executed made this game and its story more powerful than what most.<br><br>As for the narratives, I didn\u2019t feel like I was in the protagonist\u2019s shoes when I played as him. While I found myself resonating with the narratives, I\u2019ve never had terminal illness, never been a father, never been a copywriter and never been married, so that makes sense, I thought. But somehow I felt the weird sense of kinship when I participated in and guided him (or that he guided me) through his life while he calmly told the story of a man who had died of cancer, who once had everything and then nothing and how he came to accept it all and eventually let go.<br><br>It\u2019s cancer, and it breaks people, both physically and mentally. The game doesn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re going through the same kind of torment or make it outright awkward hanging all the sentimentality on the nose but it does give you a glimpse of something of the situation. It has the kind of solemnness and reverence in itself that made the emotions expressed even more honest and real and at the same time reserved than the gameplay itself- Some are kept raw, and some are more or less carefully generalised so that parts of the story became every journey whose goal is to reach the sort of final acceptance after all the confusion denial depression and anger you scrape up at the rock bottom.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30258187', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30258187' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30258187\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30258187' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30258187\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30258187', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30258187_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30258187_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30077859\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gecimen\/recommended\/388420\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"35196242\">gecimen<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 3.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn between is a puzzle platformer, driven by a sad story much like The Bridge or Braid.

I'll start with a quick summary of the game, what I thought about the general pros\/cons, and then end with the reason I decided to write this (which might contain spoilers).<br><br>In Between is a puzzle-platformer about a man who is dying of lung cancer. The game progresses him through the five stages of grief, each with a different puzzle element. There are memory fragments you can discover as you make your way through each stage to give you a clearer picture of who he is (his motivations, family life, background, etc). It all adds together to create a beautiful narrative, and the difference of the puzzles through the stages does a wonderful point of thoughtfully backing it up.<br><br>Pros:<br>+Soundtrack is simple, repetitive but not pleasant, does a good job of evoking the right emotion for the setting<br>+Story is good, and gameplay backs it up<br>+Main character\/family people of color, always a plus to support representation, especially in the indie scene<br>+Difficulty is set just right for most puzzles (I had to come back a few days later for some, but then &quot;got&quot; it pretty quickly)<br>+The hardest levels of each stage are optional<br>+Achievements (other than YODO) feel actually achievable and worth it<br>+High replayability<br>+Felt like it was play tested thoroughly<br><br><br>Cons:<br>-Controls take some work getting used to, and might benefit from &quot;tighter&quot; movement\/slightly smaller hitboxes<br>-There are times when you know exactly HOW to solve a puzzle, but have trouble actually DOING it due to a few extra obstacles (mainly spikes) some levels might not entirely need<br><br>Now, why I personally decided to write this review (spoilers possible):<br><br>In Depression, you must stay in the light; in other words, you can't give in to the darkness.<br><br>The last stage in Depression is incredibly frustrating. I think I tried it at least (probably more) than a hundred times. I had beaten every other level in the game, and was determined to continue with that trend. I was starting to get so frustrated it almost made the beauty of the rest of the game start to fade. I blamed the game design, the controls, the lack of checkpoint where it seemed obvious to put one... I was just astounded by why this was happening.<br><br>Eventually (probably after a culminated 2 hours of trying to get through the level), I finally just decided to skip it. I don't think I've ever felt so mad at a game before, if I'm being honest. It felt totally unfair, unnecessarily punishing... I started to wonder &quot;what did I do to deserve this?&quot;, and decided I could come back to it later.<br><br>Then, I played through Acceptance. To keep this as spoiler-free as possible, Acceptance is comparatively much easier than Depression, and took much less time to get through. And as I reached the end of the game, I was emotionally compromised. <br><br>So, I decided to play the last level of Depression again. At the beginning (that I didn't hear since I had originally started the level), the main character says &quot;In the end, it's a question of dignity. How long do you continue grasping for the last straw? How desperate are you for another way out?&quot; and I suddenly understood the point of that level, and the point of the last stage.
