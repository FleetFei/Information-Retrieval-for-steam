Maybe it wasn't really my sort of film.<br>Nonetheless, it was ok to watch.<br><br>The two end scenes were decent ones, so that was a plus in its favour. There's nothing worse than watching a show which turns out to have a rubbish ending, but that wasn't the situation with this movie - so the writers did well on that score.<br><br>I should note three negatives aspects of the production:<br>1) I found it a bit slow to start with - although that may have been necessary, just to lay out the background for the story.<br>2) The scenes regarding the daytime television awards were a bit stupid, and quite a stark contrast to the nature of the rest of the movie (the kitchen fight scene was a bit that way as well) - it was almost as if a different writer had come up with those parts. The scenes for the daytime television awards were a very poor attempt at humour, which followed a style which has been used in various low-grade productions, and they just made the show look a bit stupid. Thankfully those scenes didn't go on for too long.<br>3) There seemed to be some discordant background noise in a couple of places (e.g. at 17.42 min.) - I don't know if that was just with my download (although I did double-check that spot in the film) or if it was meant to be some sort of ambient noise.<br><br>Not the best movie I've ever seen, but certainly not the worst, more of a middling affair.<br>The acting, filming, music, and production were all very good.<br><br>5.5\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29558058', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29558058' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29558058\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29558058' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29558058\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29558058', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29558058_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29558058_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/488250\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29558058"]}
