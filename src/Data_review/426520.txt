In fact they're pretty bad, but I try my best**<br>**It's 2AM and I'm really sorry if my review, if you can call it that, makes no sense**<br><br>Yo, this movie is straight up bonkers!<br><br>I've never read the book\/series and the movies are my first actual exposure to this.<br>And I'm really enjoying it.<br>Dank memes aside, these movies are pretty cool.<br>I mean it's still a love story, but good Lord.<br><br>I'm not sure what could be considered a spoiler, but<br>Spoilers<br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>So yeah it's pretty much official. Edward and Bella get married.<br>But before that.<br>Victoria's &quot;One True Mate&quot; was killed, torn apart, and body parts burned by the Cullen family when Bella was attacked by her &quot;Husband&quot;. Victoria has been on some kind of warpath after her husbands death by the Cullen's.<br>Then it gets crazy.<br>The Volturi, an ancient Coven of Vampires meets Bella after Jacob tries to imply to Edward that she died.<br>Edward heads to Italy to basically commit suicide, because he thinks that the love of his life has died, by exposing himself to humans. The Volturi would have found out that Edward broke a rule and he'd be sentenced to death by decapitation, limbs being ripped off and sent to be burned. At least from what I believe.<br>But Bella comes in just in time to save Edward.<br>Bella has a run in with the Volturi and is basically given a second chance at life on the condition that she become a Vampire. And those dudes are serious. There's even a vampire that can look at you and basically leave you inoperable but in massive pain. It's bananas.<br>Edward is telling her not to become one. It's not the life he wants for her, but Bella wants to become one to be with Edward forever. Most of the Cullen family agree that she turn, but one other in the family that opposes the transformation and tells her why.<br><br>Jacob is part of a tribe of &quot;Spirit Warriors&quot;. Basically they turn into big wolves and wreck house. Not everyone in the tribe is one, but few are.<br>He's telling Bella to not become a Vampire telling her that it would be the same if she was dead. Implying they already are. Walking husks that can think and talk.<br>So he's trying his hardest to change her mind. He announces his love for her and Bella enters some kind of love triangle. And Edward knows this and is willing to let her go if she chooses to leave.<br>She also punched Jacob in the face, but broke her wrist. And Edward is absolutely livid thinking that Jacob hurt her.<br><br>Then more crazy stuff goes down.<br>Bella basically unites the Wolves and Cullen Family to fight this horde of new born Vampires bred by Victoria. Victoria doesn't expect this and is shocked when she see's what is happening. They fight and Edward kills Victoria by ripping her head off of her body. But Jacob is severely injured. His ENTIRE right side of his body is just broken bones. Jacobs regenerative ablities kick in, but it'll basically kill him. The doctor, who happens to be the Alpha in the Cullen clan helps Jacob by rebreaking his bones to let them heal properly.<br><br>The Volturi have some kind of hand in this and probably used Victoria to breed an army of vampires. Or maybe there's innerworkings happening in the Coven itself. <\/span><\/span><br><br>Can't wait to watch the next one.<br><br>TL;DR<br>Vampires and Wolves duke it out.<br>Some kind of conspiracy is going on within a group.<br>Love triangle with Bella, Edward and Jacob.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23132245', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23132245' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23132245\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23132245' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23132245\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23132245', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23132245_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23132245_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/426520\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["23132245"]}
