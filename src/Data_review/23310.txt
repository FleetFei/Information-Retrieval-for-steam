But I really love this game for this.<br><br>After over 100 hours and maybe 3-4 times restart halfway through the game (because I can't defeat one of the side mission boss, its almost impossible to beat unless you know the trick), now I can finally beat him for good. Its so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing hard for godsake, I don't even remember how many times I decided to stop playing 'cause I'm not even sure if the bosses are beatable, but I just keep coming back to it. I never finish this game before, not even once. As for now, I got maybe 60% or so of the story, I guess. But, yeah, 3 times of 60%. And its been 7 years since the first time I played it LOL.<br><br>If you are a casual gamer and you don't wanna waste your precious time over this ridiculously hard game and just wanna sit back and chill while playing your JRPGs, don't buy this game. But if you are a hardcore gamer who want a new JRPGs experience, you love challenge and you do want to challenge yourself, stop reading, do yourself a favor and get this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30521442', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30521442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30521442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30521442' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30521442\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30521442', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30521442_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30521442_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30477998\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296523060\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"336257332\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296523060\/\" data-miniprofile=\"336257332\">worship.me90<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296523060\/games\/?tab=all\">17 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296523060\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296523060\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">22.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'd recommend this game for the battle system, which I found really interesting.<br><br>(Really, really long blocks of text ahead. Sorry. TLDR at the end.)<br><br>The story was meh, I felt it was a little confusing at times, and not particularly gripping. However, I'm really not one to follow the plot carefully in RPGs (what am I doing playing RPGs then? haha, you have a point...), so I've probably missed some parts that would've prevented the confusion and maybe even foreshadowed the ending. Still, not a tale that grabbed my attention.<br><br>The battle mechanics were what really drew me in. It's brilliant! I've put in way more hours than the recorded 15. Once you run through the game fully, you get to start a new game in hard mode which is a whole other challenge (worth the torture, in my opinion).<br><br>As plenty of people below have pointed out, combat is turn-based and rather than controlling single characters, you can fight with 'unions' of characters. At each turn, you give general commands to each of the unions, and the AI picks the different attacks\/spells for each of the union members (you can see what gets picked, but you can't change this specifically during battle). And that's one fun part of the battle system- it might seem like all their actions are out of your control, but careful union setup with suitably trained characters makes a HUGE difference in the sets of commands you get. You even get to fine tune the kinds of attack\/spells each union member can execute by blocking some of their learned skills. This helps increase the chances of the AI picking up the attacks you want, since you've removed the ones you didn't need, even if it's just for a particular battle.<br><br>You're free to set up your unions as you wish- have separate unions for offense\/tanking\/healing\/debuffing (like most sane people), just have an army of attackers slashing through monsters (this may actually end badly...), maybe, like I usually prefer, have self-contained unions capable of looking after themselves in battle so that you can forgo a healing union altogether, or all of these at different points in the game. You'll need a bit of care with how the unions are set up and how members are trained, otherwise the commands generated during battle can be really useless and frustrating. There's a lot of flexibility to this system, which becomes clearer as you progress further into the game and begin handling more unions; if you've trained your characters decently enough in their roles(warrior\/thaumaturge\/mage\/warrior-mage\/whatnot), you can swap them around a lot and calibrate their skills to try different kinds of union set-ups, and this allows you to try out any number of strategies for tough battles. That said, there will always be few hiccups out of your hand. Veeery few, if the unions are decent. <br><br>The other fun part about the battle system is that once you've worked out a few stable union combinations, just hit the spacebar and the AI does all the gritty work really well, and you can focus on your overall battle strategy\/approach instead.<br><br>Stat increases are not random, their general direction of growth will depend on how you use the characters. Spam spells all the time and you'll see your characters' INT levelling far quicker that STR, and finally ending at a much higher number. But this is as far as our immediate control over stats gets, as far as I'm aware.<br><br>There is a 'morale bar' on every battle screen, and the gauge changes depending on how the battle's going. Maintining a decent morale in your favour can have a big impact in boss fights especially.<br><br>The game does have a strange levelling system, where grinding is not always rewarded (there are a couple of tricks to super-powering your characters early on at specific spots in the game via grinding, but that just really sucks the fun out of the whole experience). This, I feel, is a good thing; gives you more time to just explore the world, kill all the monsters, loot all the dungeons. Contrary to what's mentioned often, you don't have to skip -all- battles at first or be excessively wary about over-levelling. I have a habit of clearing out every new map, which is just what I did for my first playthrough, and ended the game at a Battle Rank of 144. Some of the boss battles were hard, but not too hard (except the Lost Remnant, maybe), and certainly not unbeatable. The hardest point in the main storyline in that playthrough was the part called 'The Nest of Eagles'- took 4 tries to finish it at ~BR 60 (considered a fairly high BR by most for this part of the game), but the fight needed a whole lot of re-organising on my part, and this made the win even more satisfying. Basically, the higher your Battle Rank, the more challenging the fights can get, but they rarely become insurmountable. I personally love the lack of intense grinding here, it just let me play the game to the end casually the first time around.<br><br>There are several classes you can train each of your characters to get into, depending on what skill sets they can acquire, and which ones you focus on. The Wiki is a great place for all the information you need on classes (and everything else). There are lots of weapons to choose from (a plus for me), each with different upgrade paths. Lots of scope for crafting. Nice loot from the bosses.  With the game config files as is, however, you can only change your main character's equipment. The others have set weapon paths, and you can only choose their upgrade focus (combat\/mystic\/balance).<br><br>There are lots of sidequests to complete; the bulk of your time will probably be spent on these. So if you become friends with the battle system, this can only be a good thing. <br><br>The DLC battles are great, in my view. My favourite part of the playthrough.<br><br>Graphics are cool, but this point is probably very subjective. <br><br>I've had no issues running this game, performance-wise (on a system with recommended specs), and have been able to run this on a system with specs slightly lower than the minimum suggested (significant lag, but that's where I finished my first 3-odd playthroughs, and I loved the gameplay enough for this to not trouble me!)<br><br>If there's one major complaint I have, it's that far too many playable characters come too late into the game, and are much weaker than your current set of characters. If you don't watch the BR, this difference becomes even more stark. <br>Or sometimes they're really cool, but you're almost at the end of the game so what's the point in hiring them.<br><br>TLDR; the battle system is very intriguing, give it a shot! Especially if you like battles. The game seems to be perpetually discounted on here anyway.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30477998', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30477998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30477998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30477998' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30477998\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30477998', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30477998_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30477998_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t616 of 658 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary8564784\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"99685872\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/90\/901620ccb023037208d0d128707060a2aade5687.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/90\/901620ccb023037208d0d128707060a2aade5687.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/90\/901620ccb023037208d0d128707060a2aade5687_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/\" data-miniprofile=\"99685872\">[TNC]Locker#1<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/games\/?tab=all\">36 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/warutaru\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">349.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's begin with a simple tip to make life easier for keyboard players:<br>Main Screen &gt; Settings &gt; Gamepad (4th Icon) &gt; Key Signal Display &gt; Keyboard.<br><br>Secondly, bookmark this page:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/lastremnant.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/lastremnant.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_Guide<\/a><br><br>You're welcome.<br><br>---<br><br>I got into this game via a demo. The demo left me wanting more, and Steam had it on sale, so off I went to get it.<br><br>I'm on my second play through. The first play through was messed up beyond believe. I didn't know what was what and got stuck in a boss battle that I could not win. That bit frustrated me to no end and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 me off greatly. I went off in search for a guide to overcome the boss battle. To my dismay, none of the guide helps as I've done something I should not have done: killing everything in sight and trying to spread the EXP love with all my party members. The end result was a severly gimped party lacking in both stats and skills.<br><br>I stopped playing for a couple of days and dived deep into the wiki. I learn the proper way to play the game, picked up a majority of the content that I just zipped past without realizing it, and focused on growing my party members the proper way. Second time around, the game was infinitely less infuriating and way more fun. The boss that I was stuck at in my first play through became a breeze, though the game did something rather nasty after that particular fight. Thank god I was somewhat prepared for it, equipped with both knowledge and power to overcome that nasty bit. The resulting satisfaction was very, very high. <br><br>From then on, the game became something I want to explore in depth. I trawled through the wiki and its discussion pages to learn more about the mechanics of the game. Although I've been vigilant in keeping track of the missable content, there are still a number of things that I inadvertently got locked out of without realizing it. I am currently one boss fight away from the end of the game and already I am laying down the foundation for my new game plus. <br><br>Despite the amazing depth of the game, or rather, due to it, the game will eat you alive if you don't know what you\u2019re doing. The game does not make obvious certain crucial information from the get go. Playing the game with a lack of information can lead to a really bad experience, especially if you play this game the way you would a normal RPG.<br><br>With that said, the game is excellent for those wanting a good challenge. There is a vast amount of content within the game, and it should keep someone busy for the next 100-200 hours.<br><br>Update (22 Feb 2014): I've just finished my third playthrough and I'm taking a break to plan for my fourth playthrough. It seems that once you've finished the game once, you just keep going back for more. This game is one of my best investments in Steam.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8564784', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8564784' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8564784\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8564784' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8564784\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8564784', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8564784_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8564784_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t384 of 403 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">28 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>9 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12495547\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"164009718\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c320d417556d0d94550c9eefda0bff2a617765ba.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c320d417556d0d94550c9eefda0bff2a617765ba.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c320d417556d0d94550c9eefda0bff2a617765ba_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/\" data-miniprofile=\"164009718\">lovinglife139<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/games\/?tab=all\">1,219 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/recommended\/\">37 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/lovinglife139\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">105.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 14, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Last Remnant is my favorite JRPG of all time, and definitely holds a place of my top 10 games of all time. Here's why.<br><br>This game is wholly unique. Usually, when one says &quot;JRPG&quot;, you have a good sense of what you're getting into. Cliched characters (whether you like those cliches or not), quirky personalities, a turn-based battle system, a long convoluted story with plenty of twists, and be prepared to roll your eyes or shake your fist at the screen for some character antics or story twists you saw coming from early on. In The Last Remnant, little of this is true. The story is unique, the art style and characters are unique, some of the twists and story archs are surprising, and the battle system is so unlike anything else you've ever played, somewhere between a JRPG and a large scale strategy game with army simulation elements.<br><br>This game is known to be quite challenging. I bought the Xbox 360 version on the game's release date, and have beat the game a few times and put a couple hundred hours into it. After completing my first PC playthrough tonight after about 90 hours, I can say for certain the PC version is about 3000% easier. An update was made to the game that made a few changes that made the PC version exponentially easier, though it is still more challenging than the average RPG. So if you happened to try the 360 version and were turned off by its difficulty, I urge you to try the PC version.<br><br>The Last Remnant needs to be commended for its ability to have realistic and relatable characters, and multiple characters you care about and will remember forever. In this game, you are able to literally build up a small army to take into battles with you, where enemies and your people are separated into &quot;unions&quot; rather than each person being separate from one another. It is here where the game brings in large-scale strategy type battles, allowing the unions to act as one unit. Strategy fans will delight in the ability to hire soldiers and characters for their army, picking and choosing people based on their unique skill sets and abilities. You are able to hire people you've perhaps done quests with, or people you've never met that happen to have a skill you've never heard of, just because you want to see it in action. You then pick and choose which people to put with whom, how to set up your unions, etc., giving limitless possibilities for your army. Also, your followers will often ask for certain items, ingredients, etc. throughout the game, which they'll use to upgrade their equipment and become even more badass. (And trust me, this game is full of badass characters.) You can also dictate how your soldiers level up, as they ask you from time to time if you want them to delve into a different skill set or art style.<br><br>Even if the game had a terrible story and cliched characters, the battle system would keep me crawling back. Battles are by far the best part of this game. While some will say that some boss battles can be &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;unfair,&quot; I'd argue that your characters also unlock plenty of abilities and special moves that are just as if not more cheap or unfair to the enemy (Blackout is ridiculously powerful, for example, and that's a move my unions ended up using frequently). In summary, fights can be nail-biting, because you are constantly reminded that you are fighting enemies that are just as skilled and able as you. Will you still scream at the game in frustration? Sometimes, yes. But I've personally also nearly broken things with excitement when a single decision or a stroke of luck turned the tide of battle. Also, I'll let it be known that I find games that are hard just to BE hard quite annoying and to be little to no fun. This is not a game that is consistently cheap or unfair. It can be extremely challenging, and you'll call BS on a fight from time to time, but with strategy, that same fight on your next try could be immensely rewarding and much simpler.<br><br>The Last Remnant is a refreshing game in a genre that is usually predictable. It has a gritty realism that is usually reserved for western RPGs. It also respects its characters. You'll find no little girls with parasols fighting in battle, nor will you have a guy insist on being shirtless while on the battlefield (seriously...whenever I see that, I think about how easy it'd be to take them out). The characters--while they can be quirky and humorous at times--are never walking cliches. Each woman or man has her or his own personality, back story, goals and motivations--and YOU get to decide whether or not to add them to your army and help them grow over time.<br><br>This game is a true gem. It is nothing less than a crime that a game of such originality is not mentioned in conversations of JRPGs more often. This is the JRPG that I hold every other JRPG up to--and until we get another game in this universe, I see no other game coming close. I cannot recommend this game enough.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12495547', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12495547' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12495547\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12495547' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12495547\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12495547', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12495547_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12495547_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t114 of 123 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17863873\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/doomsdayforte\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46380386\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7d\/7dff6a48e796a08d94e711183ed4f3418944f845.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7d\/7dff6a48e796a08d94e711183ed4f3418944f845.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7d\/7dff6a48e796a08d94e711183ed4f3418944f845_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/doomsdayforte\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46380386\">DF<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/doomsdayforte\/games\/?tab=all\">980 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/doomsdayforte\/recommended\/\">38 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/doomsdayforte\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">99.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 3, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI bought The Last Remnant for $3.74 in 2011, and it took me four years to finally get around to playing it.  It took me 99 hours to get to the end because I went out of my way to do all of the important sidequests, so if you're not interested there, you can be done much faster.  There's also a demo if you want to try a bit of the game out for yourself.  I played the game entirely with the Xbox360 controller and did not try keyboard and mouse.  <br><br>The Last Remnant is a type of strategic RPG that masquerades as a standard JRPG.  There's a lot that it does differently than compared to a JRPG, but then it's also pretty different from your standard SRPG too.  Or tactical.  Whatever.  I've seen it compared to Ogre Battle and I've heard that TLR was originally a SaGa game, but I haven't played anything in either series so this game stands as quite unique for me.  The story is kinda all right, I liked being able to go back to the city sector screen from anywhere in town, and there are a few catchy battle themes.  <br><br>Combat is a fairly different affair compared to the typical &quot;everyone stands in a line and makes hitting motions at the enemy&quot; kinda game.  Instead of having between three and five people out at once to save the world, you field a max of 18 in the second half of the game, though it's not entirely as though everyone's running around doing their own thing.  You put your characters into small parties of up to five members each, or unions, where everyone pools HP and AP for special moves--but the enemy does it too.  This is a game where positioning and attacking the enemy's side is important, but unlike grid-based strategy RPGs, you can't directly order your your unions into a position to trap enemies.  <br><br>The game works on a Deadlock mechanic.  Basically, two opposing unions meet on the battlefield and fight it out until one of them is dead.  At least you can break Deadlock to attack another group or heal, and the enemy can't.  But the idea is that both groups are focused on only the other, so you can have another group attack that preoccupied enemy group to flank them, and continue to gang up on them to get further damage and morale bonuses.  Of course you're vulnerable to being flanked, so it's generally a good idea to assign everyone their own target, and to target the flunkies in boss battles first since everyone focusing on the boss first leaves everyone's back open.  <br><br>There's also the morale feature to keep in mind.  Unions have their own Limit Break-styled morale meter, but there's one at the top of the screen that affects both sides of the battlefield.  Most battles start with it in the middle where neither side benefits, but one side getting an advantage will result in better combat performance.  Enemies appear in the field and you're given an opportunity to initiate combat (on top of trying to draw as many into one fight for a higher challenge and more rewards), but if they catch you, they'll start with a free turn and the bar in their favor.  A stat buff for the majority and a stat debuff for the minority sounds insignificant, but it's very noticeable in practice.  Some tougher enemies will use devastating attacks when they control the morale bar, so shutting them down is a top priority.  <br><br>There are QTEs during battles.  I know some of you are rolling your eyes already, but I like to think of it closer to a timed-hits mechanic versus &quot;press this button to not die&quot; like in some games, since the prompt comes up during the same part of the animation.  The chance for the prompt is tied to the battlefield morale, and during an attack, you're given one of five buttons (default A, B, X, Y, and right trigger for X360 controls).  Successfully press the right button in time and the next person on your side in that Deadlock will leapfrog to the top of the action queue and do their move, getting another prompt.  Hit all of the prompts to finish the combo and the last person on your team will attack with a guaranteed critical hit.  There's a prompt when being attacked too--parrying results in a stun, blocking with a shield results in a damaging shield bash, and evading results in a heavily-damaging counter attack.  Given battles are largely an affair of picking orders and then watching everything play out, this does keep things kinda engaging, though you can also set the game to handle the prompts for you at a lower success rate.  <br><br>When it comes to control, there's not a lot that's in your hands.  You're given a choice of up to five orders per union, ranging from &quot;attack with your weapon!&quot; to &quot;use Combat Arts!&quot;, but you may not get the prompt to heal or revive somebody when you really need it.  And even if you do pick &quot;use Combat Arts!&quot;, that doesn't mean everyone in the union actually will, even if they have enough AP.  Some of it is down to union composition, though there's also union morale to consider.  You can at least turn off individual arts if you don't want people using them.  You can't directly give any equipment to anybody except the protagonist, Rush.  There's an .ini edit to circumvent this, though that has its own hangups.  There's a pretty robust item creation\/upgrade system, but your characters can only request things you have in your inventory already and they may not ask for or even use things that logic states they should.  You can assign unions their own formations, but you can't exactly move people away to avoid the big boss' area-of-effect attack, so you have to hope that everyone is standing in the right place to not get torn apart.  <br><br>The only real problems I had with the game were texture pop-in and laggy gameplay, even on a solid-state drive.  Cutscenes weren't immune to this either, but at least you could pause to let everything load, or pause and then skip them if you wanted.  The game was also more difficult than I'd consider other JRPGs or the like, though I wouldn't put it up there with the hardest games in the genre.  A lot of it can be avoided by setting your teams up well, though there's still a luck element involved.  This is also one of the few games I've played where trying to do all of the major sidequests makes the final boss significantly harder.  Given you have to beat a very difficult boss for that 100% completion before a certain part of the story, it's not really suggested to attempt this on your first time through--there's a New Game Plus feature so try it on your second loop.  I kinda hurt my enjoyment of the game by having to grind out because of my unknowing mistake.  <br><br>But despite all that, I really did enjoy my time with The Last Remnant.  I've never quite played anything like it, and while there isn't as big a drought for JRPGs on PC now as there was in 2011, this game is certainly unique enough to be a keeper in my book.  If you have any interest in the game at all, you really should try the demo out.  It manages to be a fun experience without falling back on established Final Fantasy references or the like.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17863873', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17863873' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17863873\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17863873' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17863873\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17863873', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17863873_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17863873_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t120 of 132 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18421409\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"40542397\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac7f19bccb3afcfe475f7c690041b4154a0b7c74.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac7f19bccb3afcfe475f7c690041b4154a0b7c74.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ac\/ac7f19bccb3afcfe475f7c690041b4154a0b7c74_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40542397\">Nabutso<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/games\/?tab=all\">96 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nabutso\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">94.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI got into this because I heard of a $100 prize being offered to anyone who streams and beats this on vidyashorts. This challnge had been going on for years, with the prize getting higher and higher. You'd think if someone is paying for you to play a game it must be either \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, or they're just a rabid fan of it.<br><br>A few hours in, I understood entirely why someone was willing to pay to have someone play through it. This was an incredible game that gave me the same vibes that Dark Souls did when I first played it. It had challenge to it, but at the same time I had never heard of it. Watching someone go through the hard times just like when you did on your own play through, watching someone play TLR must be incredible.<br><br>Going into The Last Remnant without the wiki open makes it hard, but rewarding. Every challenge you overcame felt more rewarding than the last. Not just because you're clearing things, but because the game always rewards you in some ultimately useful way; not how you'd expect from a &quot;typical&quot; JRPG. You do the side quests, you end up with good party members, access to newer areas (or expanding upon ones you have unlocked already), and even the ability to use more skills for Rush, the main character. While going off and doing your side adventures, you're running into harder and harder challenges - rare monsters are (fairly) abundant, and you get the urge every time you see a green name to fight it. Who cares if you lose? You can save anywhere.<br><br>It got easier towards the end because I had take a tip that fighting more monsters at once meant you got more rewards than fighting smaller groups, even if the total monsters defeated during a trip into an area was the same. I skipped a lot of fighting, instead juking around monsters. There are no random encounters, so your progression as far as &quot;levels&quot; (Battle Rank) is entirely up to you. This game has level scaling; if you level up too much, the fights get harder. This isn't a problem if you aren't purposefully grinding or you're good at dealing with groups of monsters, to help increase your gains.<br><br>The story feels like it has odd pacing because of the way that side quests open up during it. Keep in mind if you're stuck and don't know what to do, talk to the guys behind the counter in any pub. They'll tell you about side quests, and typically you'll find the next story trigger in there, if you're lost on where that could be. <br><br>I didn't fight the superbosses, but they exist. After beating the game, there is a NG+ which allows you to enable hard mode. Normal fights can last a long time, too. I fought rare monsters which required 30 min just for one attempt at it. When I got the hang of things and became stronger relative to what the game expected, the fights got easier and shorter. Never faceroll, though, except for a few isolated cases.<br><br>This game, while it is a JRPG, doesn't contain the expected JRPG elements you're used to. This is good both for longtime fans of JRPGs who can still play it and enjoy the elemtns which it keeps, as well as for people who aren't really into JRPGs. Nothing silly like buying a new weapon you saved all your gold for just to find it in a chest in the next 'dungeon'. You don't wear armor, just a weapon, shield optional, and 2 accessories.<br><br>This is one of those games where you really like the characters because they are actually useful. Random quest at the start of the game gives you access to a bad-\u2665\u2665\u2665 who you wish you could take out for drinks irl because of how much he helped you early on. Guy from another quest who &quot;isn't much of a fighter&quot;? You get him too, and hes some ultra badass as well. Cute girls with big swords, old men who will die for you, giant silent warriors, a previous villian and his &quot;dog&quot;. These are just a few of them. They help you get through the game in more ways than one. Almost every character has their own storyline of some sort, and you wish you could keep them all!<br><br>Took me 70 hours, completing the story + tons of side quests (no superbosses, skipped some near the end because I was enjoying the story); but only about 70% of the game's total content.<br><br>Plays best on mouse and keyboard. Oh, and turn auto camera follow off, so you can look around easier at the great landscapes while you're exploring them.<br><br><br>Story: 7\/10 ~ The pacing, since side quests are so fun, ends up being odd. However, the story itself is good when you're actually doing it.<br><br>Graphics: 8\/10 ~ For a 360 game, it looks good. The battle effects arent bad, in fact, they're really satisfying. Magic isn't as fun as melee combat though. No native anti aliasing.<br><br>Fun - 9\/10 ~ I went into it expecting some marginally entertaining dynasty warriors-meets-FF thing. I got something much better than that. With genuinely satisfying gameplay, I never turned turbo mode on. I left critical triggers to auto and still enjoyed 90% success; I got to sit back and relax as I watched my units do the commands I gave, coming up with my strategy for the next turn. Having your units make a big play to win a very difficult fight is amazing.<br><br>$ value - 9\/10 ~ You'll be playing this a long time if you want to explore it all. I typically played in sessions of 3-8 hours, of which, only 1\/3rd was story related. Rarely can you spend $10 and get a 50+ hour game nowadays. Estimate over 100 hours+ if you do not 'cheat' (read wiki, guides).

Despite my inability to get past a boss fight around 80 percent of the way through the game, I really enjoyed it, so I was glad to see this game on Steam. <br><br>I was even more glad when I started to play TLR again and realized a couple of things: it's a lot easier if you understand the skewed leveling system (and I'll get to that in a second) and the PC version has made a lot of interesting quality of life improvements to the game. Really, it feels like the only thing missing from the PC version is... achievements. (Okay, actually, my other complaint would be that whomever did the cutscene animation has apparently never watched a living person walk before because the modeling is terrible but -- that's minor.)<br><br>So back to the leveling system. TLR is really interesting in that it removes all control from the player in terms of leveling characters and, to a certain extent, control over a character's actions in battle. So while the lack of control will take some getting used to I actually think the battle system is really fun, if unique. The leveling system, however, causes problems. Essentially TLR has two leveling stats: individual units\/character stats (which the game auto-levels\/assigns for you) and battle rank, which levels your entire party\/army. What I didn't realize the first time I tried the game on the 360 was that having a high battle rank is... actually really bad. The higher the battle rank, the longer it takes for stat increases and the harder the enemies are to beat (to the point where if you have too high a rank, like I did, a boss battle literally becomes a one-shot and completely impossible encounter). So, I'm definitely having a much better play-through on the PC because (a) the PC version seems to have reduced some of the connection between battle rank and difficulty and (b) despite how counter-intuitive it is to NOT level in a RPG, I've managed to keep my battle rank pretty low. <br><br>That said, the game has an interesting storyline (that I'm eager to finally finish) and is definitely a completionist's nightmare. The main questline is actually fairly short but there's a MILLION sidequests and a couple hundred challenge quests (e.g., kill a specific monter, find a particular item, gain a specific level, etc.) so there's a ton of stuff to do. <br><br>If you have a good 40-50 hours to kill, you like the idea of transhumanism, and you like SquareEnix, or just JRPGs, I definitely recommend this one.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12735299', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12735299' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12735299\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12735299' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12735299\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12735299', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12735299_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12735299_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">11 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29515327\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46349565\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13a232036ba53f0303fe4fd9c23d1b72f2feace0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13a232036ba53f0303fe4fd9c23d1b72f2feace0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13a232036ba53f0303fe4fd9c23d1b72f2feace0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46349565\">Ashe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/games\/?tab=all\">97 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006615293\/recommended\/23310\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">773.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOkay so as someone who I just checked has over 500 hours in this game...  I think that qualifies me to write a review on it.  <br><br>With that many hours I like the game.  I will break it down into the pros and cons for new players deciding.<br><br>Pros<br>Hands down my favorite large scale battle system.  It balances controling multiple squads facing off against armies without being to micromanaging and yet with still a bit of flexibilty.  Their are some frustrations and a steep learning curve to it though.  You rely upon the computer to bring up your selections and there is a lot of mechanics that go into it from your class, to your formation to your party leader.  Outside of combat selections and even your party build up can dramatically effect your combat.  But when you do finally get the hang of all that you can lead your forces into some truly epic looking and feeling battles.<br><br>Scenery is lovely in the game and has held up well.  Some areas get repetitive when you are still hunting for rare monsters but usually the areas themselves look pretty.<br><br>The leveling system i enjoy but it might not be for everyone.  Basically when you begin the game you get to decide how to equip your main character.  The rest of your party you can only choose one of three focuses so they are less customizable. But overall I like the fact that one game I can make him an assassin leading an army, the next a ninja and a combat hog, and a third game an epic healer magic user, and if you have enough patience you can master them all.<br><br>Negatives<br>The main character truly has an annoying voice and personality.  How can i play a game so much that I hate the main character?  Well because I truly love the epic battle system it is relaxing and a lot of fun and it gets better and more epic as you go through the game.  And the first time you pull of a synergy or you start busting out the remnants it truly does have an epic feel to it unlike many other games. So just suffer through the main character and enjoy the fights.<br><br>The storyline.. This game was built to have sequels.  It does not to the best of my knowledge have any in the works yet.  Would love to explore more of the world.  This one has a lot of potential.<br><br>The learning curve...  You will hate or love the game for the first few hours.  At about hour twenty your going to find someone trick in battle that you didnt realize you could do and things will be easier.  And then youll starting finding combos you can use for end game.  Or formations and specializations.  So the learning curve on this game sucks.  At a hundred hours your still going to learn new tricks and techniques to make the battles more interesting or fun.  Yet while it sucks to take forever to learn it means that there will always be a new little trick you can pick up that will help you later.  Or someone to add to your party in a combo you didnt think of.<br><br>So the grind is what will get most people though.  Doing all the side quests takes time.  And the first time you have to run across the great sand sea you will appreciate ground transportation that other games have.  This one you have your feet.  No way around it sorry.<br><br>Overall seems like there is a fair bit of negatives with the postives.  So why do I recommend it so highly?  Because like legend of dragoon the combat is interactive.  The effects in it have stood up the test of time and truly capture the chaos and epic feel of army combat.  Some games will capture that but this lets you control your army in a more fluid manner.  I wish other games had a similar UI. Basically even after 8 years since its release...  The game is still unique in its play and fun to engage in.  Hope some others will give it a try.  That they will be able to suffer through the learning curve and the challenges and find some enjoyment  in it.  And if enough like it hopefully they will make a sequel one day.<br><br>Thanks for your time and the short novel read.  Have fun my friends and best of luck to you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29515327', 'summary' );

It's a great game from the makers of Final Fantasy, yes that's right they make RPGs Other than FF. The interesting thing in this is two fold, first it's on the Unreal Engine, not a in house engine. Second it's M rated for blood. Now the blood is pretty old school, especially by todays standards. We aren't talking dismemberment gore here, just people get hit and blood splashes out of a non-existant wound. The graphics aren't horrible, they were good when it was new. The interesting mechanic here is the combat, it's turn based but more strategic than just waiting for your turn. The gameplay is actually quite a lot of fun, and in typically JRPG fashion the story is convoluted and extremely long, with lots of little hidden things to find around towns, cities and caves. Overall, if you're a JRPG fan, I recommend giving this a shot if it's at a price you like. HOWEVER, there is one IMPORTANT catch, this game uses one of those awful 'keep up' leveling systems from what I've been told, the higher you level up your characters the stronger the game becomes, your true 'power' comes from the skills you obtain and they can be obtained in many cases at any time. Like most games as complex as this one, you're better offer doing a lot of research before you even start to know exactly what you should do and how to go about it, NOT pursuing certain things right away and trying to power level your character ever will really really hurt you. The old enjoyable act of running around leveling to gain an edge is ruined with this design. Now if you don't enjoy old school RPGs and like a game that keeps pace with your level, this should be your thing. If you like old school RPGs though where you level up and eventually feel like a super Hero, this might be a struggle. You NEED to follow a guide that explains everything, because becoming powerful is about keeping your level low while doing everything to enhance your skills.

This game is seriously flawed. The only reason that I'm recommending it is because it's fairly cheap and does have its upsides, but I'd still wait until it's on sale. <br>Pros:<br>-Interesting and numerous sidequests.<br>-Interesting concept<br>-Great battle music<br>-Lots of arts<br>-Some cool animation<br><br>Cons:<br>-Battle system is extremely random, if you play the same fight twice you can get absolutely destroyed the first time and completely slaugher them the second time doing pretty much the same thing.<br>- Punishes you for leveling up (strangley enough the surest way to beat this game is to avoid fighting as much as possible)<br>-Punishes you for trying several weapons (you will wind up downgrading your nimble\/mighty arts unless you stick with those types of weapons.)<br>- Characters and story are pretty generic and boring.<br>- 99% of important stats and exp happen off screen.<br>- The game does not teach you how the battle system works, you need to look it up and study it.<br>- Morale system doesn't work well, if your winning by a landslide this just makes it easier, if your getting beaten down this just makes it worse, and some enemies will constanly lower morale gauge regardless of how you are doing.<br>- Area attacks and some status ailments are horribly broken. Area attacks basically do normal damage times however many units you have in a union and may even hit other unions. This will often oneshot you and they use them VERY often. Some status ailments in this game are easy to deal with (silence, burn) while others are pretty much a death sentence (poison, curse).<br><br>All in all this game isn't amazing and somtimes it feels like the bad outweighs the good but you might like it so it may be worth dropping a few bucks on. Still wait for a sale though.

It's not perfect, by any means but it's very fun to be able to recruit a mercenary army and go to town on an entire squad of enemies while still having a turn based style system.<br><br>I'm not really a fan of the Battle Rank system which doesn't make much sense. Basically, the enemies in the game scale based on how many strong monsters you kill, so grinding actually hurts you. So does... killing pretty much any mobs apparently, unless they are incredibly weak. That said, it's interesting to have an RPG that -encourages- speedrunning instead of requiring you to grind a lot!<br><br>It also has one of my favorite JRPG soundtracks with some incredible battle and area music. The game would be a lot more boring without its stellar soundtrack adding some personality to the areas.<br><br>These days the graphics look a little dated. The art design is somewhat generic, with many of the enemies having a stereotypical look to them, though I do like how many different sentient species there are in the game's world. The character design is hit or miss, though some of the characters do look pretty badass. Hint: It's probably not Lord Davide.<br><br>The storyline is just enough to make the game interesting, but isn't amazing. The main character, Rush, behaves really weirdly like he has the personality and impulse control of a 10 year old, which can break suspension of disbelief. There are more interesting and cooler characters in the game though, like Davide's generals and Emma Honeywell. The overall story about the Remnants isn't explained too well, and the Remnants end up feeling like big Macguffins with no rhyme or reason to their existence.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30304986', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30304986' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30304986\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30304986' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30304986\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30304986', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30304986_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30304986_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/23310\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 2,746 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30521442","30477998","8564784","12495547","17863873","18421409","9790680","10550902","12735299","29515327"]}
