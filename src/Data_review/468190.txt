Gust was founded in Japan in 1993 and rose to fame in Asia in 1997 when they first released <i>Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg<\/i>. While the developer started becoming more renowned worldwide in the early 21st century, the <i>Atelier<\/i> series evolved into their flagship franchise. Then in late 2011, publisher Tecmo Koei purchased the studio but continues to release new video games.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838384009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838384009<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">About the Pack<\/div><br>The DLC glosses over around 18 years of Gust history, but focuses mostly on the <i>Atelier<\/i> franchise; leading with Helena\u2019s <b>Marie<\/b> outfit (a throwback to <i>Atelier Marie<\/i>, 1997) down to Ayane\u2019s <b>Plachta<\/b> getup from <i>Atelier Sophie<\/i> (2015). Overall, nine games of the series are represented in this set along with two other IPs featured through Kasumi\u2019s <b>Ion<\/b> and Lisa\u2019s <b>Nelico<\/b> costumes (both from <i>Surge Concerto: Ciel Nosurge<\/i>, 2012) as well as Tina\u2019s <b>Lilysee<\/b> and Phase-4 <b>Arnice<\/b> wardrobes from <i>Nights of Azure<\/i> (2015).<br><br>Even though all the costumes are well designed, one can\u2019t help but notice a strong change in character design choices between the late 20th and early 21st century. For example, Mila\u2019s <b>Elie<\/b> outfit from <i>Atelier Elie<\/i> (1998) \u2013 moderately plain, monochrome, and conservative \u2013 pales in comparison to Marie Rose\u2019s <b>Totori<\/b> dress from <i>Atelier Totori<\/i> (2010). Her costume comes in like a wrecking ball with a pleated, seethrough miniskirt, pastel color gradients, and lots of tiny details.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838344901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838344901<\/a><br><br>With that said, two of the most appealing outfits in this set are that of Honoka and Leifang. The former dresses up as <b>Rorona<\/b> from <i>Atelier Rorona<\/i> (2009), the latter as <b>Meruru<\/b> from <i>Atelier Meruru<\/i> (2011). Leifang\u2019s costume seems like a fantasy version of a hussar uniform, with a pastel top, golden bootlets, a rainbow mantle over her right shoulder, and a staff on her back. Honoka\u2019s outfit, however, trumps with a very fashionable alchemist getup, complete with a pink beret, a cape, as well as a short, brown leather skirt with matching magic bottles attached to her belt.<br><br>The only vaguely difficult ensemble in this set is that of Hitomi, based on <b>Sophie<\/b>\u2019s look from <i>Atelier Sophie<\/i> (2015); the combination of a red, pleated frock underneath a teal overcoat with wide cuffs causes a lot of clipping, which, to be fair, isn\u2019t really noticeable during matches. In fact, the designers paid a lot of attention to detail so that Hitomi\u2019s wardrobe matches that of the original, even down to the awesome boot design or the jam-packed rucksack. And she is not alone with that.<br><br>All of the costumes stick true to their source material. Kokoro\u2019s attire really appears like what <b>Shallie<\/b> wears in <i>Atelier Shallie<\/i> (2014), Rachel \u2018s <b>Jurie<\/b> outfit from the same game is on point too, and even without the parrot, Nyotengu looks the part of <b>Judie<\/b> from <i>Atelier Judie<\/i> (2002). It is further appreciated that the apparel worn by Christie is that of <i>Atelier Meruru<\/i>\u2019s (2011) <b>Esty<\/b>, who is as serious a character as her.<br><br>Still, in spite of the attention to detail given to this pack, hardcore fans might be slightly disappointed that the YouTube trailer from 24th of March 2016 for this DLC set (<a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gbB7I_htJmE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >DoA5LR \u2013 Gust Mashup Costume Trailer<\/a>) indicates between 0:48-0:49 that Momiji wears the outfit of <b>Iris Blanchimont<\/b> from <i>Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana<\/i> (2004), while her in-game outfit is more akin to the more revealing garments worn by <b>Iris Fortner<\/b> in <i>Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm<\/i> (2006). Despite that, all costume were designed with utter thoroughness that makes it easy to recognize their source material.<br><br>The definitive showstopper here is that of Phase-4, who comes with two outfits based on <b>Arnice<\/b> from <i>Nights of Azure<\/i> (2015). In the console ports, Phase-4 shapeshifts into the heroine\u2019s blaze demon form by taunting the opponent, but in the Steam version, both appearances take up a different slot in the character select outfit menu. This is a great way for player to get the complete set on home computers.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838383805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=838383805<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div><br>The thoroughness and attention to detail with which these costumes were created is visible everywhere in this set, the high heels worn by Tina alone are proof of that. Another welcome element is that both forms of Phase-4's costume were included, which leads me to believe that hardcore fans of the Gust JRPGs and the <i>Atelier<\/i> series will like this set and enjoy using it during their gameplay.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Characters Included<\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Ayane as Plachta from <i>Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book<\/i> (2015)<br><\/li><li> Christie as Esty Dee from <i>Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland<\/i> (2011)<br><\/li><li> Helena as Marlone \u201cMarie\u201d from <i>Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg<\/i> (1997)<br><\/li><li> Hitomi as Sophie Neuenm\u00fcller from <i>Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book<\/i> (2015)<br><\/li><li> Honoka as Rorolina &quot;Rorona&quot; Frixell from <i>Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland<\/i> (2009)<br><\/li><li> Kasumi as Ionasal \u201cIon\u201d from <i>Surge Concerto: Ciel Nosurge<\/i> (2012)<br><\/li><li> Kokoro as Shallistera \u201cShallie\u201d Argo from <i>Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea<\/i> (2014)<br><\/li><li> Leifang as Merurulince \u201cMeruru\u201d Rede Arls from <i>Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland<\/i> (2011)<br><\/li><li> Lisa as Nelico from <i>Surge Concerto: Ciel Nosurge<\/i> (2012)<br><\/li><li> Marie Rose as Totooria &quot;Totori&quot; Helmold from <i>Atelier Totori: Adventurer of Arland<\/i> (2010)<br><\/li><li> Mila as Elfir \u201cElie\u201d Traum from <i>Atelier Elie: The Alchemist of Salburg<\/i> (1998)<br><\/li><li> Momiji as Iris Blanchimont from <i>Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana<\/i> (2004) or Iris Fortner from <i>Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm<\/i> (2006)<br><\/li><li> Nyotengu as Judith \u201cJudie\u201d Volltone from <i>Atelier Judie: The Alchemist of Gramnad (\u2013 Imprisoned Guardian)<\/i> (2002 \/ 2010)<br><\/li><li> Phase-4 as Arnice from <i>Nights of Azure<\/i> (2015)<br><\/li><li> Rachel as Jurie Crotze from <i>Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea<\/i> (2014)<br><\/li><li> Tina as Lilysee \u201cLily\u201d from <i>Nights of Azure<\/i> (2015)<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29151987', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29151987' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29151987\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29151987' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29151987\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29151987', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29151987_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29151987_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29151987"]}
