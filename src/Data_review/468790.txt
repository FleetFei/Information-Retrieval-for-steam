And let\u2019s face it, there aren\u2019t a lot of options if you\u2019re into floating eyes.<br><br>Cellpop Goes Out at Night is a sequel to The Real Texas, but is quite different in terms of mood and gameplay. Unlike The Real Texas, there\u2019s no combat and it\u2019s much more bitesize, taking around 3 to 4 hours to complete. Without wanting to give too much away, despite the jolly mood, one of the key themes is \u2018frowned upon substances\u2019 \u2013 or in this world, iris blotting.<br><br>Once again, the writing is good, if somewhat twee in places. You can change your \u2018eye clothing\u2019 and even wear a fancy pin to compliment your \u2018outfit\u2019. Even better though is the music, which is overtly jolly most of the time and foreboding when it needs to be. If you were the jigging type, you\u2019d do a little jig to this.<br><br>It\u2019s often the little things that sell a game, and that\u2019s absolutely true in this case. Chairs are called \u2018resty\u2019 and if you decide to sit, you \u2018descend onto the resty\u2019. Adorable. The art style is much the same as The Real Texas \u2013 simple, but quite endearing.<br><br>So that\u2019s the good. The not so good? Well, it helps to have a map. Also, if all of your characters are floating eyes, it really helps to be able to tell them apart. OK, they had different patterns, but with the number of eyes buzzing about, it felt somewhat arduous trying to find the one you wanted. I hope that doesn\u2019t make me an eye racist. But I did spend nearly an hour looking for \u2018Rusty\u2019, who managed to elude me at nearly every turn.<br><br>The food system was also a little annoying, given that I accidentally fell into a sugar coma a couple of times, ran out of salad, and then ran out of money to buy any more food. Still, you can search through cupboards and closets and find money on the floor, and I got the hang of it eventually.<br><br>All in all, despite it being rather confusing from time to time, it was an enjoyable trip (pun intended) and an all round adorable game.<br><br>PS: Never iris blot, kids.<br><br>This game was reviewed using a review code on behalf of TeamTomReviews.
