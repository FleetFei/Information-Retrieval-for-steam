It reminded me of Goetia, which I liked a lot. The game is not too hard, I only got stuck a couple of times, and the monsters aren't too difficult, although one part was getting a bit frustrating, because I got totally lost and it took a long time to find the way out while dodging the monsters. The story is interesting, although it gets more depressing as it progresses. The ending binds the entire story together, but the final scenes were really too easy, considering how much trouble it took getting there. It's a short game as it took me under 4 hours to play it through and I took my time with it, trying to find all the notes to get the entire story. However, I only paid \u20ac1.49 for it, so it was definitely worth that.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30745558', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30745558' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30745558\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30745558' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30745558\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30745558', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30745558_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30745558_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30607117\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MatchaGreenTea\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"163045585\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/7131d87e9c80e3421abcd4326f1272b4a24c4960.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/7131d87e9c80e3421abcd4326f1272b4a24c4960.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/7131d87e9c80e3421abcd4326f1272b4a24c4960_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MatchaGreenTea\/\" data-miniprofile=\"163045585\">MatchaGreenTea<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MatchaGreenTea\/games\/?tab=all\">279 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MatchaGreenTea\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MatchaGreenTea\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFriendly Ghosts, Bloodstained Stuff, Invisible Spiders, and the Dude that Got Away With Murder (PG-13)<br><br>To be honest, I got this game because, from watching the previews, I really wanted to try out the whole astral projection or &quot;going ghost&quot; feature. It did not disappoint! That was, by far, my favorite part aside from hunting achievements, which was one of the reasons I held on for long. Although some are missable, most of them you don't have to work too hard for as they pop up while you're doing quests. <br><br>The heroine is a headstrong and spunky character - not very difficult to root for. I like it that when the atmosphere becomes more hostile in an eerie way, she gets scared too and shows it, pressuring you to figure things out fast so you can get out of wherever you are ASAP. <br><br>The storyline's okay. Although the main focus was on saving the heroine's father, the bigger picture began to unravel itself along the way. I'm glad they chose 2D graphics for this as some scenes are pretty macabre. I'm still wondering what happened to the other ghosts, though. Some were able to cross over after being helped through quests, but what of the others? Did they all cross over when the main hurdle was passed? <br><br>If you're expecting a horror game, this is not it. If you like mystery and puzzle solving games, though, you may just enjoy this. I suggest getting this game when it's on sale as it's pretty short.

When you take more common, action oriented titles, it can be easier to tell from just a minute or two of uninterrupted gameplay footage if a game is going to be worth your time or not. But slower paced, narrative focused titles, like Whispering Willows, are considerably harder to figure out from just viewing a short trailer. Games like this are driven by their quality of narrative and puzzle design. Does the crisp and whimsical imagery evident in WW\u2019s screenshots affirm a similarly elegant literary and brain teasing experience? Unfortunately, no, not even close. But Whispering Willows is still an endearing first effort by fledgling studio Night Light Interactive, even with the game\u2019s numerous flaws. In fact, it\u2019s more what the game <i>doesn\u2019t<\/i> try to do that is most disheartening.<br><br>I\u2019ll begin with the most egregious error this game makes: the quality of narrative. The story is thus: young Elena\u2019s father has gone missing, and has been for some time. After waking from a particularly vivid nightmare of her father being held captive by <i>something<\/i>, she races to an old, decrepit mansion, of which her father is the groundskeeper. She soon meets the ghost of her ancestor, who teaches her of her heritage, and of her innate ability to leave her body and walk the earth as a spirit, allowing her to commune with the ghosts of those who have yet to pass. What follows is a supernatural tale of loss, deceit and the darkness that festers within. <br><br>In truth, the narrative plays out like cross between a darker Goosebumps tale with bits of Clive Barker\u2019s grotesque imagery. This is partly due to the art style; it just doesn\u2019t convey feelings of foreboding and fearfulness that I believe the narrative wants to. Worse, the story takes virtually no risks. But what really hurts the experience is the quality of the dialogue. Throughout the adventure, you will speak with the deceased, and often be asked to find items of importance to them to progress through the story. The dialogue that occurs here is just, well\u2026 the best thing I can call it would be, \u201cserviceable\u201d. The dialogue is so often uninspired and plain that it would keep me from really caring for any of the characters\u2019 plights.<br> <br>I feel I\u2019ve spoken enough on the negatives of the narrative, so let\u2019s move on to the disappointment of the game\u2019s main mechanic, your spirit form, and the weak puzzle design dependent on it. The lack of pluralization is not a mistake, Whispering Willows\u2019 mechanic of Elena\u2019s spirit form most often offers only a single type of puzzle throughout the game. You will come across locked doors, and you will either need to pick up a poorly hidden key or flip a switch. Usually, this means that there is a finely carved, perfectly square hole in the wall or ceiling near to you for your spirit form to slink through. Do so, and there will be a bright blue glowing <i>thing<\/i> for you to interact with. This interaction opens the door. This is how nearly every \u201cpuzzle\u201d in WW plays out. I can only think of a handful of individual puzzles that do not play out in the same way, though they themselves were no more complex than filling a hole or playing Simon Says with a moveable object. The simple puzzle design falls in line with the game\u2019s progression; it\u2019s largely linear, with nary a handful of instances where you will have to seek out an item outside of the area you\u2019re already in. Even then, though, the item\u2019s location is always spelled out for you, so this is really no more than a mode of adding longevity to this short adventure. And it <i>is<\/i> short. In total, I completed the game in under three hours.<br><br>Whew, that was a lot of negativity. How about we move on to the more positive aspects of Willows? Speaking purely of the in-game graphics and art style, my opinion is decidedly varied. On one hand, the environments that you explore never amount to anything special, and much like the dialogue, they are content with remaining largely serviceable. The same can be said for the few human characters in-game, who, along with some stilted animations, look oddly plain. This is in stark contrast to my favorite portion of the game, the ghost designs. Their visages reflect how they died, and their appearances range from the grotesque to cringe inducing. Their designs are absolutely phenomenal, and it\u2019s evident where the best of the artistic talent went in the creation of this game. The same can be said for Elena\u2019s own spirit form, whose flowing hair and glowing visage look fantastic, especially in the light of the full moon in outdoor areas. <br><br>While the dialogue between yourself and haunting spirits itself does the overall narrative little favor, your interactions with the ghosts of the mansion\u2019s grounds are enriched by the previously mentioned collectible notes scattered along your path throughout the game. Each is one of several diary entries left by the formerly living, and each tells a tale of their final days. While few of them are terribly unique in their subject matter, finding that final piece of each story provided me a greater driving force for playing than the main narrative itself. <br><br>As negative as this review has been, the greatest fault I can levy against this game is not what it does poorly, but rather in what it does not even attempt to do. Given all that has already been done with a similar ability in other games, why is Elena\u2019s spirit walking ability as limited as it is? The game is content with delivering only the most lackluster and plain variation possible. And the dialogue... in an adventure title such as this, gameplay often takes a backseat to the narrative. Only, in this case, both aspects are severely limited in their designs. If the sole gameplay mechanic is to be as limited as it is, why was the dialogue not given greater love, to compensate? The game is so filled with potential, and occasionally, this potential appears as though it\u2019s so near to bubbling to the surface, only to be pushed back down below by weak interactions and the umpteenth recycled door \u201cpuzzle\u201d.<br><br>I did not hate my time with Whispering Willows. Though admittedly, my want to love it so completely has perhaps made me more critical of its faults. I\u2019ll leave it at this: Whispering Willows, for all of its promise, is content with providing only an unenthusiastic effort on its part. For every glimmer of something fresh and unique, of which there are a few, Willows buries it under less-than-uninspired dialogue and consistently recycled puzzle design. I beat the game, with all of my fumbling, in under three hours.

It's a salient question in this post-Greenlight age, with many games offering impressive gimmicks and visuals propped up by only an hour or two of gameplay. Whispering Willows is just such a game, a no-frills adventure game with some charming graphics and a neat mechanic that's over before you know it.<br><br>You play Elena, the Native American daughter of a groundskeeper at a super spooky mansion. He disappears, you gear up to find him, and the next thing you know you're in the \u2665\u2665\u2665-end of some pretty dire catacombs. Like I said, it's an extremely straight-forward side-scrolling adventure game with notes to find, keys to collect, and notes to read. The one gimmick is astral projection, which releases your fabulously-coiffed soul to roam, slipping through tiny cracks, moving mundane objects, and talking to dead people. This mechanic develops one or two additional uses over the course of the game, and is pretty fun to dink around with, since there are no living NPCs.<br><br>Game flow is clear and steady, for the most part. There's no map but the mansion and its environs are usually simple enough to follow to your next objective. The hand-drawn graphics are delightful and well-animated, though I must admit the horrific condition of the spirits you encounter clashes a bit with the lighter, kids anime art style. The story rides a fine line between dark and silly and I was engaged the whole time, it's just that the whole time was about 90 minutes. It's a short, short game and if you like the simple gameplay, you'll surely be left wanting more. I'm glad I didn't Kickstart it, but if you pick it up on sale it's a charming little adventure and I can't knock it for anything but its length.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18376818', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18376818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18376818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18376818' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18376818\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18376818', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18376818_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18376818_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22792144\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SousaP\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"178517423\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/af417530c63dcad4efb0d0a4fd46690314340215.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/af417530c63dcad4efb0d0a4fd46690314340215.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/af417530c63dcad4efb0d0a4fd46690314340215_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SousaP\/\" data-miniprofile=\"178517423\">psousa<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SousaP\/games\/?tab=all\">2,973 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SousaP\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/SousaP\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn &quot;Whispering Willows&quot; you play as Elena, a young girl looking for her missing father. All we know is that he disappeared while working at the Willows Mansion. Along the way, you discover that you are capable of leaving your earthly body, through your amulet, to another realm, where you can communicate with spirits and possess objects. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The <b>gameplay<\/b> knows how to take advantage of it: to progress you have to change between &quot;realms&quot;, talk to all kind of ghosts and interact with objects.  However, there are not many puzzles to solve and they all are quite easy (there's an image with the solution always nearby).<br><br><\/li><li> All the characters (ghosts included) are beautifully drawn. The <b>artwork<\/b> is really amazing, but is in the characters where it shines the most.<br><br><\/li><li> The <b>soundtrack<\/b> is very fitting for this game's atmosphere.<br><br><\/li><li> Although, almost every aspect of this game is great, it's the <b>story<\/b> that comes on top. Sure, the atmosphere is eerie but you can only fully experience it if you talk with every character and, most important of all, if you read all the notes you find throughout the game. They help provide a more immersive experience. So, if you play the game, take time to read all the notes, they'll help you understand not only what happened but what is happening too.<\/li><\/ul><br>The game also has its faults:<br>- loading\/saving screen takes more time than it should;<br>- the pose Elena takes after leaving her body does not make sense (she should fall on the floor). Although, having to get up every time you came back to the corporeal body, would take more time and would be more annoying too.<br><br>The game isn't very long. You can complete it in few hours even if you read all the notes.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22792144', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22792144' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22792144\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22792144' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22792144\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22792144', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22792144_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22792144_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11226562\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">AestheticGamer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/games\/?tab=all\">5,088 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/\">72 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 13, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhispering Willows is a side-scrolling adventure game where you play a girl named Elena who's gone to an old abandoned mansion to find her missing dad. She quickly discovers this place has a thin veil between our world and the spirit world, and with a special necklace, can part her soul from her body and rejoin them again. With her newfound supernatural powers, she goes to find her dad and learn the history of the estate.<br><br>Gameplay is pretty simple, you walk around, observe and occasionally interact with objects, find items, and open doors. Your amulet begins to glow when near spiritual energy, in which case you press a button and you let your soul be free. Your soul can't interact with most real world objects, but can see ghost and talk with them, and turn into a tiny flame to fit into cracks. You can also possess blue glowing objects to interact with them. There's a few puzzles, and occasionally some threat appears, in which case all you can do is avoid them and run.<br><br>It's got some interesting concepts, but honestly I felt a lot of its ideas were severely underplayed. Your ghost powers are cool, but they feel really underutilized and lack any real form of challenge, except in like one occasion. There's enemies, but they're so few and far between, and most of them are easily avoided and are hardly threatening, except on a single occasion. And the game does this with almost all of its elements. It has like one moment that's kind of unique and interesting and somewhat challenging, but then that's it, it doesn't continue to build on its interesting concepts, it sort of sits on what it's comfortable with. It really left me with a feeling that I wished the game would of been more daring.<br><br>There's very few puzzles, and the only sort of challenging ones are at the very end. There's horror 'moments', but there's only really one scene that's even kind of creepy. I don't know, maybe I'm being too hard on it, but I was left with wanting the game to be more than it was at the end.<br><br>What the game is as opposed to what I want it to be is a very pretty fetch-quest game where you go back and forth between locations collecting items.<br><br>And it does look very pretty. Some nice lighting effects, matched with textured objects, unique rooms, interesting sights... It's really a visual treat. The style the game has is definitely its best element, and the number of varied locations were nice to look at.<br><br>The sound is good too. Music is appropriate with a few very pretty tracks, the game is not fully voiced but the character groans and sounds worked well with the game, and they had some good ambient sounds in the environment.<br><br>The game also did an interesting job at delving into Native American folklore, which was interesting to see unfold through the course of the game.<br><br>But honestly, outside of this, I don't have much to say on the game. It was not really remarkable to me, there were periods I felt the game was just a bit dull. The threats are hardly threatening, made even less threatening on the off-chance you die that you'll start-up almost immediately where you were as this game throws checkpoints up the wazoo. The puzzles were always the kind where the solution was right next to where the puzzle actually was, the ghost are nothing more but flavor text NPC's. And the story just felt very tried and not at all remarkable, with obvious developments and an almost cheesy climax and resolution. I mean it's not inherently a bad thing and there's nothing wrong with the game, but it just is way too safe. Outside of its very interesting aesthetic look and pretty decent sound design, there's nothing remarkable about the game, it really feels like a good engine and concept wasted on a rather cookie-cutter game.<br><br>I'm disappointed with it, but it's not a bad game. It has some interesting ideas, and has a good feel to it as you go through worn-down environments, and I'd say worth a play if you really like its style and don't mind a rather routine and simplified adventure game around its style. But that's what it is at the end of the day, and it's a game I don't think I want to go back too, or will remember a month from now.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11226562', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11226562' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11226562\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11226562' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11226562\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11226562', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11226562_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11226562_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11868630\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"73928010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0538e5c94350363ebdf3cd0e573e4d2f7d88202.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0538e5c94350363ebdf3cd0e573e4d2f7d88202.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c0\/c0538e5c94350363ebdf3cd0e573e4d2f7d88202_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73928010\">genkicoll<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/games\/?tab=all\">1,390 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/recommended\/\">42 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkicoll\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 25, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhispering Willows is a side-scrolling adventure.  It does have its horror elements (and a few &quot;EEK!&quot; moments) but overall this is a game of exploration and story-discovery. <br><br>Options include choice of Controls (I used the default), separate sliders for Sound Effects and Music, a slider for brightness (so  we can choose how environmentally dark we want it!), Language, Fullscreen\/Windowed, Screen Resolution, and Graphics Quality.<br><br>All of the controls are given to you as you play but I'll list them here for you, anyway. ;)  The default controls are as follows:  Arrow keys or W-A-S-D for movement, E for Inventory, Q to switch to your astral form, Esc. for Menu or Cancel, and Space or Enter to interact with things.<br><br>Since the gameplay is exploration-based, the devs chose not to add a running ability... but they changed their minds after getting feedback from the fans.  You can run when you are OUTSIDE ONLY by holding down the Shift key.<br><br>You CAN miss things if you don't take the time to explore everywhere -- don't make assumptions that what looks like a dead-end is *actually* a dead-end!  For the most part, you won't be able to miss things, however.  Any time your character touches something important, you'll get a pop-up at the top of the screen telling you to hit the Space key to pick it up, possess it, move it, or whatever interaction is necessary at the time.  You can look at your inventory at any time, but you don't actually need to -- all inventory items are automatically used when you need them. <br><br>The story is told via notes and letters that you find as you explore.  I recommend reading them immediately, and you can do so by hitting the Esc key when you find them (the game will tell you that every time you find one of them :p )  If you're not sure which character wrote the letter, just hit the Esc key -- you'll see the newest note's name highlighted.  ie. William Wortham 3\/15.<br><br>As you explore you will discover and -- in your spectral form -- be able to talk to the many ghosts that populate the grounds, as well as &quot;possess&quot; items for a short time and squeeze through small openings.  Although these openings have little sparkles around them, I *still* managed to miss a couple.  Another way to notice those small areas is to switch to your spirit form.  When you get near one, you'll switch from your full-form to a little bluish flame.<br><br>So how do you know when to switch forms?  You are wearing an amulet, and when it starts to glow, you know that you are getting near a ghost.  Otherwise, you just need to keep an eye out for small spaces, and things that don't quite look right.<br><br>You might think that being a side-scroller, there would not be much depth to your environment, and you'd be wrong. ;)  There are multiple layers to every area you visit, not just &quot;front&quot; and &quot;behind&quot;.  My preferred method of play is to fully explore an area before going through any doors or going up\/down stairs, but that's not necessarily what works best in this case.  'Nuff said. <br><br>You CAN die in a few spots, but luckily you won't have to re-do much, as the automatic saves are well-spaced.  Survival is not dependent on reflexes, it's all about patience and\/or moving your character to the right place.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the game, and think it was definitely worth playing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11868630', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11868630' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11868630\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11868630' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11868630\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11868630', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11868630_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11868630_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12136094\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"23481495\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/\" data-miniprofile=\"23481495\">TITOMOSQUITO187<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/games\/?tab=all\">1,101 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/\">50 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 17, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was a surprisingly fun and polished adventure game. I wasn't expecting a lot from it when I picked it up in a recent bundle, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through. It has a very polished feel to it with a lot of good going for it from its art style, musical score, sound effects, game mechanics, and even has quite a bit of humor. <br><br>It is tagged as a \u201chorror\u201d game, but really it falls more into the supernatural experience than true horror storytelling. While there are elements of creepiness and some scares, it is more of an uneasy feeling of dealing with ghosts and spirits than monsters. There are a couple of instances where you will be shocked, or surprised by events that creep up on you forcing you to run away from danger, but overall the atmosphere is more of a haunted house feel. The music is atmospheric to a spooky story, and fits well with old mansions and graveyards. The music is quite good overall, and mixed with some eerie sound effects you will feel some uneasiness while wandering around the game.  <br><br>The game is focused on telling a story of a young girl who cannot find her father. She goes looking for him and ends up at an old mansion where it seems an old rich guy who was a mayor and founder of his town used to live and get up to some nefarious practices. Things look abandoned and filled with secrets as all the people that once resided here are long gone. You are introduced to an array of characters through notes you pick up, as well as a neat mechanic that you get almost immediately. You gain an amulet that allows you to switch to your spirit form and this form is the only way you can solve certain puzzles, or interact with other spirits you will come into contact with. You won't likely miss these as the amulet will glow and make a sound when you are near an instance that requires the swap. This is explained in a way that you are part of an Indian ancestry and that you are in a place where spirituality and otherworldly events seem to be more common. I found the story and presentation well done for the majority of the game. While there was almost no voice acting in the game you got a lot of lore for the people in it through messages you find in notes and diary entries, as well as conversations with spirits that appear as a bubble above their heads. These are all short conversations so not having a voice actor for this is no big deal. I didn't find the lack of voice acting to be a negative at all for the presentation. The girl you control does make some noises and sounds when she looks at certain things, or does certain actions at times. Even laughing at weird scenes and the like so there is some of that. The game isn't fully voiced so you will have to read a little bit at times, but never an excessive amount of more than a couple paragraphs at once in a diary entry. The ending may have been a little weak, but the journey to get there was fun and enjoyable so I still was pleased with the story overall. <br><br>The art style is well done. It reminds me of the comic book style you see in a game like Mark of the Ninja, except this is darker and more geared towards those old 1800s mansions with the background settings. The gameplay is certainly nothing like Mark of the Ninja, but the graphical style absolutely is similar. It is a 2D side scroller that will have you walking outdoors, or inside mansions and other old time grounds of a mansion like the gardens, catacombs, and guest homes. While indoors you can see a couple of floors at a time, but your room is highlighted and lit up while the other rooms are either completely dark, or just dark enough to where you can see their outlines. This too is very much like how the settings in Mark of the Ninja looked. <br><br>As mentioned earlier in the story section, you get the mechanic of turning into a spirit, which is necessary to solve certain puzzles. The way this is used makes the game pretty fun to solve these puzzles even though the puzzles themselves are very easy. You will have to use the spirit to go through walls and small cracks that you couldn\u2019t get through yourself to pull a lever, you may have to use the spirit to possess an object so that you can move it and open a new path for you to continue, you may need it to deal with finding areas you can't find by reading hidden messages with the spirit form. While the puzzles in general were very easy throughout the game, I found the mechanics of getting around and the cleverness of using these mechanics fun. I enjoyed seeing how they would be used and it lead me to strange ways to enter and gain access to ares that seemed to be blocked before. <br><br>Although this is considered a horror\/supernatural tale, there is good amount of humor in the game. Some is clever, some very corny, and a fair bit of puns are used. The humor was fun and gave me a few chuckles as I played with there begin many instances of a dark humor to lighten the mood at times. Toss in a lttle bit of &quot;cuteness&quot; too and you have a little bit more appeal to the ladies probably than guys besides just the main character being a female. <br><br>I would recommend this game to most adventure fans that are interested in a casual and fun experience. Normally I would want a game that is deeper meaning and serious, but I just found this game to be fun to play, cute, and well made. Lovely art style, great music and sound effects, quite a few laughs, fun mechanics in dealing with puzzles, and just a generally polished experience. <br><br>The negatives, and things I would like to see in future games from this developer would be more in depth and difficult puzzles and the possible addition of voice-acting. Another negative and something to be aware of is that during cut scenes, the game will SKIP them if you press ANY key on your keyboard. So taking a screenshot with F12 will skip the cut scene and you most likely will not be able to go back to a save before this as this has auto-saves. Also, the automatic save system with no ability to go back, like I mentioned with skipping a cut scene by pressing F12 is a must to change for future releases. Otherwise I was very satisfied with the game, and recommend it.<br><br>8\/10<br><br>The game works perfectly fine with the Xbox 360 Gamepad I used, including on menus (which is what FULL controller support means), so this is definitely a Big Picture game you can use from the couch. <br><br>Game has Trading Cards and Achievements.

There are only a few minor negatives to it:<br>1.  You can only run outside the buildings.  Elena moves at a decent pace, but there some areas indoors where you need to back-track where it slows down the game.<br>2.  No minimap.  The areas are not too large, but it can be a bit confusing to remember where the different areas are,<br>3.  Two puzzles near the end are a bit tricky due to poor controls:<br>3a. One is located right next to the clue for it (which is fine in my book), but the puzzle is not marked well and looks just like another section of background art.  Normally the game has pop-up text to alert you to this, but the puzzle is near other backgrould objects that just has Elena comment on her family, so the puzzle are is hard to notice.<br>3b. The second puzzle is very touchy with what it will accept as the right answer.  You are given a fairly obvious hint about what to do, but even when you know what to do, it can still take a number of tries before the game accepts your input as being correct.<br><br>Other than those minor issues, this game was a fun couple of hours.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30156412', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30156412' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30156412\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30156412' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30156412\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30156412', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30156412_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30156412_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29726971\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198170429059\/recommended\/288060\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"210163331\">Alucard257<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was a interesting game very enjoyable to play.

It does have a slightly dark and creepy atmosphere, but I wouldn't call it scary at any point. I'd more place its horror level somewhere between Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and Coraline. So not for people that are into horror, more those that find darkness and ghost to be neat. Maybe those that just want a setting to be a tiny bit goth or emo.<br>The story is easy to follow, and you are able to get further backstory into several of the ghosts and their emotions when they were alive through notes that you find all over the mansion. <br><br>The puzzles were all very straight forward, and a lot of the npc in the world gives you hints on how to proceed. Which does make the game a bit easier, but also a bit more fun than the many adventure games that has absolutely silly solutions. The game also saves every time you pass into a new area, so you barely lose any progress if you get killed by <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>an evil crawling thingy or a bush monster.<\/span><\/span><br><br>As for the main character herself... I didn't really feel like she was so important, and the focus felt much more on the ghosts and her father she is trying to save. After the game the only things I really can remember about her is <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>she is a descendant of a native american shaman, she loves her dad a lot, and she thinks girls caring deeply about love letters is silly.<\/span><\/span> She seems to be the kind of protagonist that is supposed to be a mostly empty shell so the player can imagine themselves as her.<br><br>I felt the game was worth my time. It had a nice non-scary-ghostly atmosphere, a relaxing pace, and I only had to look up guides for some of the achievements, because the puzzles were all logical. I could see myself going back to replay it in a few months, if I just want to play an adventure game for a few hours one evening.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29605393', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29605393' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29605393\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29605393' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29605393\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29605393', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29605393_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29605393_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/288060\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 490 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30398357","30745558","30607117","30457917","11152737","18376818","22792144","11226562","11868630","12136094"]}
