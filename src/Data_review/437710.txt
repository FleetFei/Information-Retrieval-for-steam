The story is based on the opera of the same name by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The visuals are inspired by director Amon Miyamoto\u2019s production of the opera which was in turn inspired by video games, using multimedia projections to bring the story to life. All this being said, you do not have to be a fan of opera, Mozart or even know anything about the story itself to enjoy this game. It\u2019s a good stand alone interpretation of the original piece.<br><br>A young prince named Tamino finds himself lost in an unknown land being chased by a giant snake. He is rescued by three witches then meets Papageno, a bird catcher. After this brief introduction, the story gets underway.  The pair meet the Queen of Night, who gives Tamino a magical flute and sends the prince and the bird catcher on a journey to rescue her daughter, Pamina. The game follows the story of the opera, it is filled with adventure, plot twists as well as romance. The story is skillfully told through narration and cut scenes as you play each level of the puzzle game.<br><br>The game has thirty two stages of puzzle fun to explore and three characters you can play as; Tamino, Papageno and Pamina. The basic game mechanic is moving blocks to help a character reach the exit in a level. The levels are 3D so sometimes it takes looking at the problem at different angles to figure out to succeed. As to be expected, the game becomes more challenging the higher the level, introducing different aspects like crumbling platforms, ladders and new enemies. The game can be a bit hard at times but not in a frustrating way.<br><br>You\u2019re treated to splendid music as you play the game, as to be expected of a title based on an opera. If you enjoy classical music then you will find it easy to immerse yourself in this experience. There is nothing bad I can say about the audio in this game, it\u2019s top notch. As mentioned before, the visual are based on Amon Miyamoto\u2019s production of the opera, everything is larger than life while also being simplistic with clean lines. It gives the game a very modern aesthetic which works well for a video game.<br><br>This may not be a game for everyone, <i>Magic Flute<\/i> is a unique puzzle game telling a classic story. It\u2019s calming and good to play when you need a break between other games. I highly enjoyed the experience, especially the music and how nice it made me feel. Even at full price it is affordable and it also has Steam achievements.  I recommend picking up this title if you wish to try something different. <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Usagi\u2019s Rating<\/div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Must buy.<br><\/li><li><b>A good game to buy.<\/b><br><\/li><li>Only buy if on sale.<br><\/li><li>Mediocre.<br><\/li><li>Avoid at all costs.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_code\">For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/LotsOGiveaways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Lot's O Giveaway's<\/a> group curations <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/LotsOGiveaways#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a>!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24149448', 'summary' );

Around halfway through a large dance began (what the actual scene was I couldn\u2019t say), during which roughly a dozen women stripped off their jackets as they performed a line-dance in only sports bras. My mother was appalled, but being myself a sheltered, hormonally overrun preteen, I began to pay significantly more attention to a play I had been nearly sleeping through moments before.<br><br>It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the most scandalous encounter I\u2019d have with my burgeoning feelings of sexual attraction, though it seems oddly fitting that one of my earliest experiences would involve The Magic Flute, a play which, in many ways, is itself about sex. Mozart may have wrapped that fact within a family-friendly fairytale coating, but ultimately nearly every key plot point can be linked to sex and attraction, and the implications Mozart chose to make about them therein.<br><br>Tamino\u2019s love for Pamina is almost entirely based on physical attraction, and he himself is saved from the serpent of the first act on account of his good looks. Monostatos\u2019 character is effectively a shell of unrestrained sexual urges, and his downfall is in some ways a bigger condemnation of premarital relations than his near assault of Pamina (The Magic Flute is nothing if not a sexist product of its time). Act 2 even features a scene in which Tamino and Papageno are sworn to silence, lest they be led astray by the women seeking to mislead them. It\u2019s all a bit of a mess when viewed through modern eyes, but that has done little to curb The Magic Flute\u2019s popularity.<br><br>How exactly does this wrap around to Magic Flute the game? Well, in most ways it doesn\u2019t. Though it shares its name, characters, and music, LabLike\u2019s block sliding puzzler shares little thematic ground with Mozart\u2019s opera. Magic Flute is far less interested in exploring the romantic elements of its source material than it is in adapting its scenes (\u201cadaption\u201d being a very generous designation) into tile-based logic puzzles.<br><br>I hesitate to say that Magic Flute actually shares the same plot as its progenitor, as its narrative is so thinly told that even being familiar with The Magic Flute I struggled to follow it. Some of Magic Flute\u2019s incoherent storytelling may stem from it being in large part an adaptation of an adaptation, influenced as much by Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute as Amon Miyamoto\u2019s video game inspired retelling of it, from which Magic Flute takes its low-poly art design and Neo-Toyko setting. Magic Flute is easily among the most creative revisions of the play that I have witnessed to date, but it strays so far from the original that at some point it is hard to say if the elements it does borrow from The Magic Flute are warranted or justified.<br><br>Much of these concerns fall away while solving Magic Flute\u2019s puzzles, being themselves so abstract as to create a suitable distance between their designs and the bizarre echo of a past work that exists in the game\u2019s cutscenes and narration. LabLike hasn\u2019t reinvented the sliding puzzle, but their reworking of it is suitably engaging, if clumsily implemented. Magic Flute\u2019s style allows its puzzles to succeed without an abundance of complexity or variance. They leave little impression, but the act of successfully navigating through the mazes you construct by shifting various types of blocks around is entertaining in itself.<br><br>The fun is lessened when Magic Flute asks you to navigate multiple characters through a single level, though, as the single input interface allows for an astounding amount of error, as the same button used to move is also used to change characters depending on where you click. It isn\u2019t a game-breaking issue, but it caused me to fumble around and flub solutions often enough that I began to truly detest the game\u2019s minimal control scheme.<br><br>Accounting for only the first act of The Magic Flute, it seems safe to say that LabLike has more planned for their tiny offspring of a renowned work. And I\u2019ll be happy to see it, even if what is currently here is more intriguing oddity than anything I would call a suitable first exposure to The Magic Flute proper. Magic Flute almost certainly will not stick with me the same way my experience watching the play did, but I enjoyed it enough to hope it stays in my memory well enough that I\u2019ll remember to return when its second act arrives (which at this point is not seeming incredibly likely, but I am keeping my fingers crossed).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">You can find more of my writing on <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/kritiqal.com\/2016\/08\/29\/magic-flute-takes-mozart-to-neo-tokyo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Kritiqal<\/a>.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25235383', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25235383' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25235383\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25235383' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25235383\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25235383', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25235383_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25235383_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/recommended\/437710\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24621828\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"34685705\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50ea47e091a46efce05f199093e69d94f770a485.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50ea47e091a46efce05f199093e69d94f770a485.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50ea47e091a46efce05f199093e69d94f770a485_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/\" data-miniprofile=\"34685705\">DC PAK<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/games\/?tab=all\">2,298 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/recommended\/\">47 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dcpak\/recommended\/437710\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNice, even thought quite short, logic game.<br>Story is based on Mozart's opera &quot;Magic flute&quot;.
