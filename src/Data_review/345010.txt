I registered in the beginning of 2014, and my adventure started from there.  This game has been unique to me in so many aspects, I really don't have the room in a review to talk about them all.  The sandbox aspects, the fact it's an indie game by basically a one-man-team, or the fact it's the most expansive space-sim I've played to date, bringing back nostalgia of Freelancer.<br><br>One thing that has kept me going is the continuous rise of the community.  Slowly, we had less than five active players for weeks on end.  Then a few dozen in the next months.  Eventually, the game expanded and more players joined, and I really felt the small part of the mysterious galaxy we were all in come alive.  Industry was a boon, mining operations became a thing, and eventually the galactic market was properly being utilized which was surprising to many of us so early on.<br><br>I eventually had to take a break to focus on real life, but this game was always great about treating you right.  I could play for 15 minutes or 12 hours a day, didn't matter - I progressed.  I could skip weeks or months at a time, didn't matter, I could start off right where I left off.  It's always been a pleasure seeing the game constantly updated on a daily basis.  It's been even more of a pleasure having a dev who will directly communicate and give his time of day to the players.<br><br>I was a skeptic at first, but soon came to truly believe in there being billions of solar systems to explore, everything procedurally generating to be a unique experience every time.  Eventually, players started exploring and graphing charts of planets and moons to settle on.  Then players started constructing gates, expanding the inner systems, and really bringing the heart of the game to life - the reconstruction of the empire of humanity.<br><br>It's been over a year now, and myself and other older vets have watched this game bloom like a beautiful flower, and I'm proud to write such a positive review for it.  I could sit and try to come up with excuses all day long, but I honestly can't, this game has been going in the right direction nonstop, and has never ran out of *ahem* Steam.<br><br>If you want to see what the game looked like a year ago - and my basic introduction to it, check out my youtube channel:  <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/sinstrite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/sinstrite<\/a>  There are also new videos being uploaded right now, based on my attempt at a Let's Play of the game.  I don't think a Let's Play has been attempted with a game quite like this, so I find it interesting myself how tough it is to actually product the content.<br><br>Here are some helpful links!<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.thespacegame.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.thespacegame.com<\/a> - play in the web browser for free<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/forum.thespacegame.com\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/forum.thespacegame.com\/index.php<\/a> - the official forums<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/wiki.thespacegame.com\/mediawiki\/index.php\/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/wiki.thespacegame.com\/mediawiki\/index.php\/Main_Page<\/a> - the official wiki<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheSpaceGame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheSpaceGame<\/a> - the official facebook page<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/thespacegame.uservoice.com\/forums\/194252-general\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/thespacegame.uservoice.com\/forums\/194252-general<\/a> - vote for player ideas<br><br>I really do advise the new player to visit the wiki.  Many veterans have put in a lot of work to build it from the ground up, and even as one of the oldest players I still find myself using it constantly.  Let it be your space-bible.<br><br>Keep in mind that you purchased the game for $10.00 and paid another $10.00 for the three months of premium bundled with the purchase.  When you first start, do not use your premium right away, save it for when you will most be able to use it.<br><br>Planetary Premium - $0.99 monthly - You get access to the six other planets to build settlements on.  As a free player you can only access Ceres for grain and Vulcan for Iron.  You will also be able to produce: titanium, carbon, aluminium, meat, fruit, vegetables.  This is very good for expanding your starbase later on which brings us to...<br><br>Industry Premium - $0.99 monthly - Use this to expand your Apollo starbase to 100 rings (600 modules) and really pump out some products with your factories.  You can make a lot of progression this way as a new player, and I highly advise you to get all 100 rings going if you plan on building a colony later on.  This also allows you to use modules above class 5 such as the mining beam, ram scoop, salvage beam, etc.  This really is the best premium to purchase in my opinion.<br><br>Combat Premium - $0.99 monthly - If you want to make some credits fighting in Janus A, you want to throw some huge guns on your ship.  With this premium, you can access all weaponry over class 5 which allows you to move to the highest rank, making around 60,000,000 each mission ;)<br><br>For you want-to-be colony builders...  You need Stellar Credits.  Each premium gives you 100 stellar credits a month, so if you have all three premiums going, you get 300 SC a month.  A colony costs 80 a month to upkeep, so you can have three colonies just for having the three premiums.<br><br>OSB - Starbases that can be attached to your colony in high orbit.  They costs SC if they are not attached, but are free if they are.<br><br>Other acronyms:<br><br>MB \/ ML - Mining Beam, Mining Level<br>RS - Ram Scoop<br>TS - Trading Skill<br>SB - Starbase<br>HD - Hyperdrive<br>CL - Class<br>MD - Module<br>SY - Shipyard<br>GH - Gas harvesting<br>Hydro - Hydrogen (used to power ships when hyperjumping)<br>MP - Mechanical Parts<br>EL - Electronics<br>GR \/ Graph - Graphene (made from carbon)<br>SC, SCC, SCoil - Superconducting Coils<br>Nio - Niobium (mined from Columbite)<br>Aut - Autunite (gives uranium for contracts)<br>SS - Space Station<br>KS - Kickstarter<br>Steamie - What the players who came in through the Steam purchases are called<br>Elders - Players that have been around for a year or longer<br>Vets - Players that have played months before the Steam release<br><br>If I think of more I will add them, and one more thing...<br><br>\/ignore PLAYERNAME is your best friend.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14678012', 'summary' );

This game is amazing on so many levels. It's well worth the $20. <br><br>There are some caveats however that are worth noting to those thinking about purchasing.<br>The game purchase will get you most of the features in the game except for full colonies. To have full colonies you will need to have a premium account. For all three premium features it costs $3 a month. The point to the premium is to help support the cost of running the servers. Without premium you'll also only have access to one space station ring, with premium you get up to 100. When you purchase the game you will get a 3 month trial of the premium service so you can try out colony building if you so desire.<br><br>Even with the above caveat this is still not a pay to win game. You don't need to have premium to have a full immersive experience of the game. Here's a list of the pro's\/cons of the game:<br><br>Overall rating 9\/10<br><br>+Huge universe with 270 billion star systems with only a handful having been discovered so far.<br>+A very friendly and helpful community<br>+Fast space travel (seriously fast autopiloting system &amp; warp gates)<br>+Resource harvesting including asteroid mining, gas harvesting by skimming gas giants, colonies that mine resources<br>+Smooth stable game play client &amp; server (In over 40hrs of playing I have had the client crash once and almost no lag or latency issues)<br>+Developer that logs into the server and gets input from his players!<br>+Good tutorial that isn't overbearing (think breadcrumbs)<br>+Good selection of ships that aren't too difficult or time consuming to get.<br><br>-Registration is a tad confusing for new players and is on the list to be reworked\/fixed<br>-Graphics are not the best compared to other games out there however with graphics at max it still looks amazing<br>-Need premium to access colonies (as noted above)<br><br>Some special notes:<br>Mining: Mining is not the boring thing I've experienced in most space games where you just find the rocks and shoot them to harvest. In this game the different asteroids have different compositions yielding different minerals\/metals. Also the asteroid fields move, so the rocks don't just float in space. You have to match speeds with them and carefully fire your mining laser. The idea is to heat up the rock to a certain temperature to yield the materials. Too cold and it doesn't work, too hot and the rock explodes yielding you nothing. So, you have to pay attention to your mining beam and shut it off at the right time. Also, the range of each class of beam is different, at first you have to get within 1,000 meters to mine an asteroid.<br><br>Trading: The game has a very well thought out trade infrastructure and system. Each of the core systems has a NPC Space Station that has a local market where you can sell goods &amp; materials. Each station also specializes in producing one material for sale. Each core station also has a contract board where npc's offer contracts for needed items, passenger ferrying, blueprints for sale (for colonies &amp; player stations), specialized colony supplies\/materials, package deliveries etc. The contract board changes every hour, :15 after and :45 after the hour. The Galactic Market (or player market) is where players can offer goods for sale across the whole galaxy that can be searched from anywhere then when bought players have to travel to the selling location to pick up the goods. Also player colonies have stock markets where player harvested goods are bought and sold. With a little bit of time and help from the players you can make a lot of money trading on player stock markets or selling mined goods to colonies.<br><br>Warp gates: outside the core 8 systems traveling requires a hyperdrive that burns hydrogen. So if you want to explore you will need those things and have some good skill in gas giant skimming. Also over the last several months several of the colonies just outside of the core 8 have developed into core systems and have built their own warp gates to the core systems. There are several gates being built now (requiring huge amounts of resources) these could be opportunites for traders and miners alike providing the resources for such gates. Also if one were to invest enough time and resources into a new system they could build their own gates to and from the core systems making player trading more viable and cost efficient.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14695164', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14695164' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14695164\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14695164' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14695164\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14695164', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14695164_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14695164_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14742788\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"76994081\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f34c6184e5bd9be5cc2429034a3219951cda2d3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f34c6184e5bd9be5cc2429034a3219951cda2d3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f34c6184e5bd9be5cc2429034a3219951cda2d3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/\" data-miniprofile=\"76994081\">Waervyn<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/games\/?tab=all\">458 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/recommended\/\">33 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198037259809\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">328.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Ascent - The Space Game was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMy updated video review:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K0ZaF8WzqDo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K0ZaF8WzqDo<\/a><br><br>------------------------------------<br>My older text review:<br><br>Wow...where do I start?<br><br>Absolutely amazing game. The game is very immersive. Asteroids orbit around planets, you can land on planets to build things there, the crafting system is very complex and interesting, and you can even build your own space station which you can expand with many different kind of modules.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Very immersive environments. The space art is very nice and the planets look cool. Asteroid fields feel 'alive' with a lot of movement.<br>- Great mining system. Mining is terribly boring in EVE, X, Elite Dangerous and Starpoint Gemini. However, here the mining is spiced up due to two facts:<br>1) the asteroids have their own speed and your mining beam only has a 1km range, so you need to keep up with it (or fly very close to it)<br>2) The amount you mine is dependent on the temperature of your mining beam. Beam too little and your yield is bad. Beam too much and you get nothing at all!<br>- 250 billion systems to explore, that get named after you if you find them first! These systems can contain planets, which you can do geological research on to find out what it offers in terms of minerals etc. Other people (and you) can then colonize these planets, building factories etc. on them to profit from this planet.<br>- Player-made economy! Everything except for the most basic resources are farmed\/mined\/made by the players to sell on the market!<br>- You have to work for your things, and feel accomplished after you get a new ship or some other nice thing. Some people might mistake this for grindyness, which I wouldn't agree with (this comes from a person that absolutely despises 'daily quests' etc.).<br><br>Cons:<br>- some people dislike the graphics. I must say, when you're playing it, I think it looks gorgeous. Yes, the shipmodels are undetailed, but somehow they still look nice when you play it. But then again, I never cared for graphics that much (love Dwarf Fortress for example), so I might not be the right person to ask<br>- complicated at times. If you want to play this game, you'll have to be ok with reading up on the wiki. While features are being added, things like ejecting cargo is done at the moment through a command console. I expect buttons for this will be made at some point, but they're not implemented yet (you can program in keybinds to eject cargo etc. though, but for this you need to read up).<br><br>All in all, I'm in love. I would summarize it as a PvE version of EVE online. It's very much focussed on industry etc. instead of PVP\/ganking.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14742788', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14742788' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14742788\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14742788' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14742788\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14742788', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14742788_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14742788_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14700979\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105495096\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/021f6d411161ef18fb7f715d516af37d1f4a057a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/021f6d411161ef18fb7f715d516af37d1f4a057a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/021f6d411161ef18fb7f715d516af37d1f4a057a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105495096\">Taurophylax<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/games\/?tab=all\">94 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taurofileaxe\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Ascent - The Space Game was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor such a small development team with limited funds and an Early Access state, the game is amazingly stable. Granted I've played for about 4 hours as of writing this, but I have the graphics maxed out and have not experienced a single crash. The game could be a bit better optimized, but I wouldn't expect that at this stage. There's a few little strange graphical glitches but nothing game breaking. For example, if you buy a new ship your UI doesn't reflect the new stats unless you go back to the Main Menu and then load the map again. <br><br>On that note, this reminds me of Eve. It's a massive grind to get good progress and the game is insanely overwhelming; however UNLIKE Eve, you can get a solid grasp on the game within a couple of hours and it's all easy from then on. If you have questions, the community is very nice and mature and is always willing to help you.<br><br>So far I haven't had the opportunity to build anything yet, the few hours seem to be all about delivering goods and giving people rides to other space stations so you can earn anough credits to buy bigger ships. I haven't even touched the surface of the game and so far it's pretty impressive. <br><br>It's about as intuitive as you can get for such a massive scale space MMO. Until my view of this game changes, this post will reflect my current opinion.  An excellent game with a very active developer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14700979', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14700979' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14700979\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14700979' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14700979\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14700979', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14700979_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14700979_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22027754\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134661226\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"174395498\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1b\/1be16566830ff84f6958462ed8bfc8f48b8363b9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1b\/1be16566830ff84f6958462ed8bfc8f48b8363b9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1b\/1be16566830ff84f6958462ed8bfc8f48b8363b9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134661226\/\" data-miniprofile=\"174395498\">d3usm3us<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134661226\/games\/?tab=all\">8 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134661226\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198134661226\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">140.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Ascent - The Space Game was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've been playing this game for about 2 weeks now. First I want to address the most common complaints:<br><br>a) It's pay to win? The DLC Bowhead certainly gives you a lot of cargo space with which to make money, since the game doesn't lock ship size to any player stat other than affordability. But the game has access to bigger ships than the Bowhead, all without the DLC. Making credits is ridiculously easy. I have the next ship in size to the DLC one, the Archon, and could have an even bigger one if that's what I chose to focus on. That's after 2 weeks play.<br><br>b) hidden subscription? The game does tell you that the $20 current purchase price includes 3 weeks of premium. Not having premium does restrict what class weapon you can mount (meaning you mount more, smaller weapons) and other restrictions. But the sub price is 1, 2, or 3 dollars a month depending on what you want to do in game. Really, I spend that much daily on coffee. Ever since I've been playing MMO's I've been used to $15 a month subscrptions, and that seems fair.<br><br>About the positives- love the depth of the game. The longer you play the more you realize there is a lot out there to do, and to learn, and to build! I even tried combat route, which isn't my forte, and found it interesting. There are updates coming to the UI and the combat system. Me, I love the building starbases and colonies aspect of the game.<br><br>It's crazy interactive. Take mining for example. Find the right asteroid, match speed and direction of travel, open up your mining beam and heat it up to the precise temperature- less and you reduce the yield, more and you might explode it. All while moving! Swap out ship modules to optimize the ship to your playstyle, balancing space vs utility.<br><br>It's.. huge. At my stage of the game I look at the systems far away waiting for me to investigate... and procedurally generated space means there will be more when I get there, generated as I arrive- named after the discoverer! That is still a month away game wise for me.<br><br>The dev is extremely involved, and very positive. Check the game forums, won't cost you anything, and see the bug reports and the actions taken. The community is extremely helpful, in advice as well as hands-up, and will steer you right. They are eager to make the game as good as it can me.<br><br>Hey, this is where I spend my free time. IF you like social interaction, building, mining, combat, this is it. If you prefer to play with cooperative players and away from player harrasment, this is definitely the place.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22027754', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22027754' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22027754\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22027754' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22027754\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22027754', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22027754_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22027754_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24870474\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">EdenStarGazer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/games\/?tab=all\">705 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/\">55 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">567.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Ascent - The Space Game for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Ascent is a deep colonization sandbox economic sim with unparalleled tech &amp; scientific design. It's a combo of running the stock market, while setting up a space station for your own business in the stars. You mine, research, build, &amp; generally act like a galactic Marco Polo, with as much or as little emphasis on either as you choose.<\/div> You also take roles that resemble a tech tycoon like Steve Jobs, or an Admiral like Chester Nimitz of the US Navy. It also features political roleplay.<br> <br>The game is PVE focused. Combat is an option. You can choose to gain loot fighting pirates, as well as looking for wrecked ships by buying the location coordinates off the markets. You scan the wreckage &amp; receive blueprints to design your own ship parts. You may choose to build a smuggling operation, by contacting npc\u2019s on starbases &amp; asking them to buy contraband. Once you\u2019ve set up your contacts, you call them when ready to deliver, &amp; bribe or avoid the guards to make the deliveries. &amp;, best of all to me, you explore uncharted stars &amp; they are named after you on the map. <br><br><b>Gameplay:<\/b><br>In Ascent, you have a persistent universe that provides a validity to your actions, a sense of player agency, because what you do matters. If you terraform a planet, other players can colonize on your planet also. You\u2019ve created a new world with a breathable environment.<br>To move around in the universe, you use the autopilot to take jump gates from planet to planet (or moon.) Or, you can use hydrogen &amp; hyperdrives for FTL jumps. It has a few bugs. Nothing that affects enjoyment of the game, but IMHO, it probably was rushed out of EA a little fast (unlike some who flounder there forever.) Usually restarting the game clears any bug. They are regularly introducing new features, &amp; working out the bugs. But, there's lots of info in the community wiki &amp; on Waervyn\u2019s World YouTube.<br><br><b>Narrative:<\/b><br>The game is built upon the premise of a world that has fallen into chaos. Your mission is to reorganize the world by setting up bases of operations in the inner 9 systems, then push outward to explore the stars beyond. The game has incredibly good voice acting &amp; numerous missions that guide you through the story.<br>The actual flight tutorial doesn\u2019t seem very good, only causing stress to the new player, leaving you confused as to the focus of the game. Just say no to that, open the wiki, &amp; jump right in with the WASD interface. The early Susan Steele Missions function as a de facto tutorial. After you do the few Steele missions, you then have a while to explore &amp; expand before the later missions pop up. A simple &amp; clear guide to the early game missions is Learning to Ascend\u2019 by Max Power<br><br><b>Mechanics:<\/b><br>The mechanics let you feel like you are doing more than button pushing. Mining is like a dance with the asteroid. You pilot your ship to within close range of the rock, engage your gravity anchor to slow you down, &amp; maintain a speed that matches the velocity of the asteroid while beaming it with your mining laser. You have to watch the color of the laser to know when you\u2019ve heated it long enough to get the max elements from it. Too long will burn it up &amp; you get nothing. If you are good at playing the market, you can search the stock market for incredible deals on most rare elements, available for you to just pick them up at the seller\u2019s location. <br><br><b>Graphics\/ Sound:<\/b><br>Ascent has simplistic graphics but is very deep technologically. It can be compared to games like Civ V &amp; XCOM: Enemy Within, &amp; fits somewhere in the middle as far as graphics design goes, with Civ V having the flat map, 2D perspective, with overlays for different actions, &amp; popup messages; &amp; XCOM having a 3d map system &amp; voice-acting enrichment. You can really appreciate the fact that 1 man accomplished so much. The graphics are not of a quality you get from larger dev teams, with some flaws. But, they are totally immersive. As a matter of fact, the game ruined No Man\u2019s Sky\u2019s release for me. I got it a week before NMS finally launched, &amp; now today stopped playing long enough to download NMS, only to find myself logging out again &amp; firing back up Ascent. <br>The maps are composed of a backbone of beautifully designed planetary art that you fly through in real-time within a celestial body\u2019s range of view. These maps are lovely &amp; each system has from 3-30 moons, gas giants, &amp; rocky planets, each with their own design. For an idea of ship art, &amp; to compare sizes, see my screenshots.<br>The music is played at key moments, keeping distractions to gameplay to a minimum. The avatars are limited by 4, 2 each of male &amp; female; with no choice for personalization. The ships can be painted, with rgb color sliders, so basically you have to mix the colors to get the color you want. It feeds the Science\/Sci-fi feel to the game.<br><br><b>Multiplayer<\/b><br>It is billed as an MMO simple enough for beginners to be able to get into. &amp;, it does seem to be. The system seems less complex than other MMO's. I think that if there is a good starting place, this may be it. Ascent is the 1st MMO I\u2019ve been able to successfully navigate. Being an older gamer, with a 20+ year gap in my gaming experience, I was thrilled to find an mmo that offers intelligently creative gameplay &amp; still provides an ease of access for the casual gamer. There is a fanatic (&amp; friendly) player base in Ascent. I\u2019ve already clocked over 138 hours as of writing this review, &amp; I\u2019ve had the game about 9 days. <br><br><b>Money (&amp; Time) Matters:<\/b><br>Ascent is underpriced at $20 bucks. I\u2019ve enjoyed it more than Stellaris, because of the gameplay. The premium is unnecessary for those who just want to play normally. You would have to subscribe for a year for the cost to even approach the normal price of games like this. The 2 dlc ships are not only unnecessary to gameplay, since one is a class 1 support ship, &amp; the other is a huge Bowhead too bulky for mining. Rather, they are novelties from the kickstarter reward tiers sold to finance the dev team, keeping the price of the game so cheap for others not interested in novelties. The best ship I\u2019ve found so far for mining is the Mammoth class 10, because of its cargo capacity &amp; maneuverability. I do love flying the different ships.<br>You are sure to find many hours of your life lost to this game. It comes bundled with 3 free months of the premium access, which is not auto activated when you begin playing. I waited to activate my premium access until I had over 90 hours in the game. I could have waited longer, but I was limited to settlements on only two of the inner 9 planets, &amp; only one ring on my inner starbase, &amp;, I couldn't equip a hyperdrive above class 5 on a ship. (Same goes for ship combat weapons.) <br>Trading cards for collecting art; as well as a nice artbook &amp; music dlc package would be nice for those of us who like to see the creative process behind the game.<br><br><b>Pros:<\/b> <br>*Space flight is all very realistic <br>*Experience of a space traveler\/ merchant miner<br>*Results are skill-based, rather than luck or an old RNG<br>*Pure Sic-fi \u2026game backed by real Science<br>*Provides a command line computer for conducting research &amp; geological surveys <br><br><b>Cons:<\/b> <br>*Preset instructions flash for only a second. Change that in options before you start<br>*While in Shipyard, offers flash too fast for choosing, needs to be changed <br>*Small bugs can be corrected by exiting game &amp; reloading (works fast)<br>*Needs an in-game logbook &amp; a Transaction\/Travel Record<br>* A stock ticker on the hud would be a nice addition<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sometimes artistry is lost for the sake of making money. But, Fluffy Kitten Studios have created a work of heart, which is apparent in their pricing model as well as their gameplay.  I highly recommend Ascent for those of us for whom the world is not enough. One world, that is. In Ascent, many worlds will open up before you; worlds of celestial bodies, worlds of gameplay, &amp; worlds of scientific exploration.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24870474', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24870474' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24870474\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24870474' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24870474\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24870474', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24870474_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24870474_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15341798\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Shocku\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"81644891\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cbf0c1b20a9ca23d67d2336bd43a311d5815dee4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cbf0c1b20a9ca23d67d2336bd43a311d5815dee4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cbf0c1b20a9ca23d67d2336bd43a311d5815dee4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Shocku\/\" data-miniprofile=\"81644891\">Rask of Treve<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Shocku\/games\/?tab=all\">58 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Shocku\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Shocku\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">643.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Ascent - The Space Game was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">I Almost Missed Out<\/div>I almost didn't buy this game.

During the starter narrative and missions, you learn to trade, mine and skim Gas Giants for resources \u2013 just to name a few.<br>It is engaging and there is a lot to discover.<br><br>As you progress and, when you activate the Premium subscription you get with the game purchase (3 months of each type of Premium access), you are able to firstly create and develop Settlements on 8 of the Inner Nine (I9) systems, and greatly expand your Inner Starbase.<br><br>During this time, your Trading and asteroid Mining skills will increase, as can you Skimming skills if you continue to farm Gas Giants for resources.<br><br>Outside of the I9 are the Outer Systems.<br><br>Everything here is developed by the players \u2013 well, the Jam-1 system is a little different.<br><br>So, in the systems that are not part of the starting area, every Stargate and every colony and every Starbase has been built by the player community.  I say player community as the Stargates themselves require so much in the way of resources, it requires a number of players co-operating to complete these projects.<br><br>At all times, you are able to pilot your ship to these Outer Systems to buy from players at their Starbases and colonies, and haul resources back to the I9 to increase profit.<br><br>That\u2019s the basics and I have mostly enjoyed my experience.  <br><br>There are a few things that imo are missing, could be better, or could just go\u2026<br><br>One of my big questions rattling around in my head has been, if humans got this far into the galaxy, even after a collapse, there should be something left.  But there isn\u2019t.  I don\u2019t get that.  As a player explores new star systems with the intent to colonise and therefore open up new areas, surely there would at least be a remnant of the former civilisation.  As you can EVA on planets, I think it would be great to explore ruins of previous colonies.  Hey, there may even be some active NPC colonies out there???<br><br>Research is a bit, well, meh.  You do have to research new buildings for colonies and Starbases but, after that, it is really only improving on current technology.  I would like to see something better implemented here and, if the game incorporated \u201clost colonies\u201d it would be really cool if you could find \u201cscraps\u201d of past knowledge that might open up new research horizons.<br><br>The Political System is a bit raw, and really may not be necessary.  It is really only a system by which to name Planets and Star Systems, and these can change again if a new player is elected to a position of power.  This system has caused some schisms to form and can easily be used as a rather nasty piece pf metagame PVP.  When the Dev had to get involved with a particular dispute on the Forums, he mentioned the Constitutional Rights of the Senators (who can name Star Systems and approve Stargates), but there is no Constitution that I could find\u2026so maybe if there was one, or if System names could only be changed by some sort of consensus, it may avoid the complications of the past.<br><br>One thing that I really like about this game is the player community.  They are, in the main, helpful and encouraging every step of the way.  Freely giving advice and helping when you\u2019re stuck or unsure, the community makes this game that much more enjoyable.  There are a couple of nasties, but their impact is easily avoided.<br><br>This is a great game and should be experienced to its full.  I only hope that new directions are implemented so that someone like me can be engaged in other areas as well.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27787442', 'recent_short' );

One man to start with, Kenshi is one of these (CaptainDeathbeard). Ascent is one of these, at first you go eww the graphics are so 90s but then you do a couple of quests as part of the tutorial then you start to go. &quot;ok this is getting better&quot; then you work out salavaging, trading, building your own base and space station, of which you get as part of the tutorial ( bare bones of course).. bit of grinding trading , salavge or pve fighting and you'll start getting better and richer. It's like EvE Online without the anoying unbalanced PvP ( War Decs ect) BUT You find new planets, name them, settle systems, become govenor terraform planets, there's  270 Billion start systems, and it is better than nomans sky in that sense. Outsdie of the first nine systems everything is player made, run and ruled. So you may feel alone at the start. But they are out there! .. I'm loving it. Just ignore the graphics K :P<br><br>Game is availiable for free on the web site, but I have no problem spending 6ish bucks a month, thats about 3 bucks for the rest of you =)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26156704', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26156704' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26156704\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26156704' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26156704\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26156704', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26156704_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26156704_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25267646\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198080543482\/recommended\/345010\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"120277754\">cliffoz<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 595.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 31, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a particularly successful way of making a space game fun to play.<br><br>The developer has demonstrated an artful way of doing something he really cares about and with a lot of thought as well as care has gone into making so far.  Forget the disaster of the eagerly awaited N.M.Sky game.  This one is nothing like that and is streets ahead of it.  This has got my fullest attention and is deserving of becoming the leading game in its field.<br><br>The universe is full of delightful things to discover and to enjoy.  While there is a lot to learn, it is easily taken on board in incremental steps of discovery.  The Ascent Wiki is fantastic, as are the You Tube demonstrations. There is not shortage of tutoarial materials that you can access that will explain everything to you.  As well as this, there is a very helpful community online that are happy to take the time to answer questions as they are asked.<br><br>There is little in the way of major conflict, (unless you choose to go looking for it), as conflict is currently optional at this time. There is no Galactic War going on and I am thankful for this fact.  Having grown tired after years of eternal shoot them ups, I really enjoy this as a hobby style adventure of wonder and discovery.  The online players are working in a collaborative effort to unfold &quot;Space, the Final Frontier&quot; as you read this review.<br><br>I read that the developer intends to ultimately make a PVP area for those that are busting to have a fight with their space ships and there is already at this time a PVE area that is optional to go into.<br><br>The graphics are good. (There have been major upgrades ongoing and getting better all the time). The action is fun.  The personal development is great.  The trading system is a delight to use.  There are tons of things to do that are interesting: such as finding new places to fly and trade, discovering new worlds that get named after you, building bigger and better ships, building and developing colonies \/ making your own starbases \/ your own mining operations \/ researching new technology \/ building stargates \/ running for political office ingame \/ building the community \/ interacting with some very nice people \/ learning new strategy to build up your own wealth and prestige and lots of discovery.  There is lots of intricasy in this game.  Enough to keep you interested and occupied for a very long time.  There are lots of incredibly interesting details to learn in producing space stations \/ colony settlements \/ automted factories and NPC run trading runs.  This game reminds of a wonderful role-playing game that I used to love playing, called TRAVELLER.  I have waited a long time for a computer game that was something like it - This is it!<br><br>The game is very well priced for what you get.  I have no complaint about this at all.  For those that choose to stay with the game over the long term in the community and continue to grow your ownership there is an &quot;option&quot; to pay an ongoing fee of just three dollars a month.  There are no other costs to players.  You can play for free as long as you want to, but have some limitations on on how big you can become.  I think this is fair enough as the developer is endeavouring to keep the cost to a bare minimum.  I can't see any similar level of game that keeps the price at this level.<br><br>I hope that lots of you, (people who love to explore and develop new worlds), come and join, as I recently have, and find out just how great this new universe is to play in.  This game is not made for your typical PVP player who wants to kill everybody, or for beligerant and aggresive troll types.  It caters to thinkers, discoverers, traders, builders, collecters and social group-minded individuals. Especially the ones who love space, and would love to get out there and experience it.<br><br>The game, (as with most others), has a few minor bugs and glitches from time to time, but none of these I have found to be a game-breaking event.  The game saves itself automatically, all the time, as you play.  If anything goes wrong, a simple restart of the game has always gotten rid of the problem and put  me right back where I was with the problem solved.  The Developer is very much active in correcting bugs as they are found and continuing to develop this game much further on in the future.<br><br>Even without the upcoming development, this game is a complete game as it is right now!  You will find that you won't be missing a thing.  I give it my highest commendation.  This is a great game for me.  Go ahead and grab a copy and give it a try!<br><br>My compliments to the developer and to the players.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25267646', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25267646' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25267646\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25267646' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25267646\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25267646', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25267646_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25267646_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/345010\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 275 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["14678012","15025534","14695164","14742788","14700979","22027754","24870474","15341798","19521079","14906199"]}
