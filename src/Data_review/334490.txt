Music and sounds were decent.<br><br>Graphically not stellar but certainly passable; hidden object scenes were clear and there was no pixel-hunting or looking for badly-labeled items (&quot;is that blob a football, or is THAT blob a football?&quot; isn't an issue in this game),<br><br>Some of the puzzle solutions were downright silly, but I think that's actually what the game was going for.  I'm not thinking that they're taking themselves too seriously here so it's pretty important that players suspend disbelief too.  The solutions do make sense, they're just sometimes... well, silly.  Like I said.<br><br>As the tags clearly state, this is a hidden-object\/casual puzzle game, not a full-fledged adventure game.  Make sure you read what you're buying before you buy it and are disappointed.<br><br>The worst thing the game has going for it, honestly, is length.  Since most of the puzzles aren't grossly difficult, I pretty much plowed right through in about two and a half hours.  This makes the $9.99 cost WAY too expensive for what you're getting.  I would not get this if not on sale.<br><br>So in the end, I am going to recommend this as a short, silly HO\/puzzler AS LONG AS IT'S ON SALE - there are plenty of better games out there if you're going to pay full price.  But it's by no means godawfully bad, and worth wasting a couple bored hours with.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15008911', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15008911' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15008911\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15008911' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15008911\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15008911', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15008911_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15008911_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/334490\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 2 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["15008911"]}
