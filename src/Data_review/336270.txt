If you had asked me about this Racing game this time last year I would have said.<br>FFB is not good the Graphics look old &amp; the lack of Content &amp; pricing is bad.<br>Its also felt like the whol project have stopped<br><br>Its was still Simbin back then these guy I had know about since before they started to make payware.<br>They had cou their as had many people back in the old days of EA's  &amp; ISI F1 series .<br><br>By developing a series of GTR based racing mods of very high quality.<br>Simbin was collection of some of the best modders around.<br><br>What followed was their first steps into developing their own stand alone games but still using ISI's G-motors  game engine.<br><br>GTR , &amp; then GT-Legends are now  know as two classic sim  based raced still played today.<br><br>However part of the team split &amp; can found now as SMS the makers of  NFS Shift series &amp; now P-Cars.<br><br>Simbin then Made their Race series &amp; the GTR2 &amp; GTR Evo.<br><br>Then Came RaceRoom.<br>But it all seemed to go a little flat last year.<br>But then came the new of a new name Sector 3 &amp; what seems like 2nd coming.<br><br>Also maybe also the fact that new kids on the block Like AC &amp; P-Cars  along with I-Racing &amp; R-Factor 2 were all heading to or are come to the Steam platform.<br><br>Several updates have changed the sim for me from just been in my collection to being a must drive.<br><br>At the start of the year I had only the Free content so very limited .<br>Now I have two packs &amp; some tracks.<br>I still do no fully agree with their sales model , but the quality of the DLC is very high.<br><br>I picked up the ADAC Pack a few months back.<br>That gave me some tracks at last &amp; some of the best GT sports cars around at this current time.<br><br>But I love my old cars.<br>My era been the mid 80's &amp; 90's I remember the  likes of the DTM when it was screened on Eurosports &amp; screen sports not just in Germany but across the world.<br><br>The likes of the Merc 190 evo . &amp; BMW M3  &amp; Audi Quattro have since become legends.<br>This pack gives you those legands &amp; some less well known one for the like of Ford &amp; Opel.<br><br>This pack screams quality thanks to several updates to the main game engine you can now hear every bumps twitch &amp; rattle of the cars as they fly around the tracks, if that was not enough the Engine sounds alone make you want to come back time &amp; time agine.<br><br>These people are for sure the best best sound team around of any of the current Racing platforms all the sounds are correct for ever car in the pack not just some sound re-worked for every car.<br><br>The driving part is also top class I am not going to say its the best out there as this is one place that at least two other Sim could be seen as been equal or better depending on how you like your cars to drive in a sim.<br><br>This is one for personal choice.<br><br>RaceRoom also as one of the best FFB models out there so you soon get a good feel for the cars.<br><br>The cars all have their own good &amp; bad points  all drive differently even using default set-ups things feel good.<br><br>I find the Ai very good that is another part of the sim that as improved this year in leaps &amp; bounds.<br><br>For me this is a good as any of the other Sims that are around now .<br><br>Yes its a locked platform now modding allowed.<br><br>Its still been developed .<br><br>Online is still alpha but is already of a very high standard.<br><br>You get proper racing cars in RaceRoom from the leading racing Championships in Europe for the main part.<br>More is coming both for cars &amp; Racing series.<br><br>I do like the fact that you can just buy what cars &amp; packs you want . however I still have some issue with the Micro sales system &amp; limited cars packs through Steam<br><br>Sector 3 choose to sell most of their content via their own site , while only offering a limited selection of content Via Steam.<br><br>That for me I would like to see change.<br>Not Every one want to used Paypal or Credit card Systems.<br><br>Lots like the Steam wallet system &amp; cards that can be found in almost every retailer these days.<br>By not selling all their Pack content at least via steam I think they are costing themself lost sales.<br><br>This could be just down to costing issue with Steam &amp; Sector 3 over the costs of selling via steam.<br>But the fact is Steam is today the platform most use to buy their games.<br><br>Its also the place all their main rivals use to.<br><br>To sum up the DTM 1992 pack is about as good as it gets . I have driven some of the same cars in AC &amp; that is good sim.<br>But due to the depth of the same cars found in RaceRooms DTM pack its wins hands down for me.<br><br>One thing is for sure you wont be getting bored thrashing these oldies around.<br>All that is missing is Nordschleife . but that is WIP &amp; coming soon.<br>Then will the real fun start with these cars.<br><br>A must have for any Sim Racer.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18460836', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18460836' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18460836\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18460836' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18460836\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18460836', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18460836_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18460836_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19538539\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166958457\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"206692729\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d6674569dbd63d608d942e4e2238860074c373d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d6674569dbd63d608d942e4e2238860074c373d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d6674569dbd63d608d942e4e2238860074c373d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166958457\/\" data-miniprofile=\"206692729\">shalakocore<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166958457\/games\/?tab=all\">136 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166958457\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198166958457\/recommended\/336270\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 6, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is the best car pack to get for your first set the cars are easier to drive than the super cars are but still pack a punch good to learn to walk before you run.

I think that for that reason alone, I have to recomend this pack.<br><br>As far as what this pack includes, you get 5 cars, all of which are early 90's era dtm cars (turing cars for those who dont know)<br><br>unlike the wtcc packs, including the classic turning pack. dtm is still pretty fast, often focused on grip mixed with a v8 engine.  all of these are rear wheel drive cars with a lot of mechaic grip, all with alot of torque. the speed, despite being about 20 years out of date by now,  is still plenty fast, and the times are close to that of modren gt3. these cars also tend to be extreamly resposive and very light on the stearing. <br><br>what makes this pack worth it is as follows. Each of the 5 cars have their uniqe power and handling traits following this pattern, handling focused bmw &gt; merc&gt; opal &gt; audi &gt; ford power focused.  the diffrents is speed on the longer straits ends up as high as about 25 mph, but the ford also has the worst breaks by far so you will be outbreaked by the others.  unlike the gt3 cars, its really easy  to get these cars unstable under breaking, under power, and even flicking it around when stearing too aggressavly.  however, the mechanical grip is pretty solid so you can usualy recover from driving errors. because of this, you can really refine your driving skills and even less experance drivers can do decently with a bit of pratice,<br><br>now, that being said, as no tracks are avaible via this pack, I do not recomend you buy it first, grabbing the adac gt masters, or the dtm experance of your choice will offer 9-10 tracks and a decent set of cars. but if you already own enough tracks, then this pack is worth it. <br><br>To sum it up, You get 5 cars, each sounds and drives amazing, with enough diffrences between them, they all have enough of a edge to be fun, they all do time attack well, drift well, and race really well.  not much else to say. if you want to see for your self, test drive them in the ingame store.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20337233', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20337233' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20337233\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20337233' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20337233\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20337233', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20337233_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20337233_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["18460836","19538539","20337233"]}
