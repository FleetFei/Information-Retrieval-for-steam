You're on the trail of a mysterious creature. However, the end is kinda disappointing though very humourous. Indeed, the whole universe is using some humour and irony. Kira herself can make some hilarious comments. But I must say that the story isn't really the positive point.<br><br>I will say that the gameplay isn't quite the standard one for the genre: each object is shown in your inventory but is in pieces and your goal is to find them. Those in red are those that aren't revealed or hidden. Sometimes, an action elsewhere will unlock them. Once the item is glued back, you can use it only in the scene. Some objects can be carried over but it's generally the animal key unlocking the mirror leading to another part of the world. Some parts of these items are very hard to spot or tiny to see, that's why I didn't really like at first that gameplay. After a while, you get used to it. Besides, while the gameplay isn't something I would recommend, the idea to have a second mirror leading to an inversed room is also nice. Some actions done there will be reflected in the real world room and the contrary is also possible. That's probably what is saving Snark Busters from being frustrating like hell. The puzzles themselves are easy, which is probably balancing the fact of these parts of items hard to find.<br><br>The graphics are done in a humourous carton style, which means that the humans aren't even realistic (women are shaped like an hourglass). The steampunk universe is also very respected in the clothes. The worlds are also varied out there: from the desert to an appartement and passing by the beach and an underwater lab, you bet that the beginning in your room isn't as adventurous as the other locations (though your own garden is also nice). The soundtrack is also nice, though I must say that I didn't really pay attention to it.<br><br>I'm quite mixed about this game: the story is kinda disappointing and I'm not receptive to the gameplay. However, I really enjoyed myself, just for the news given by the TV about Kira's disappearance and for the challenge to see other locations. I played it in second, because I've done House of 1000 Doors just before, just for the sake of remembering and improving a little my review of the stand-alone version on Steam. I realized that the Snark Busters are the ones affected by the achievements, even the one hour straight of play. It's disappointing to see that House of 1000 Doors didn't get at least some achievements but hey, I can go without them.<br><br><b>All Revved up<\/b><br>The second game of the trilogy switches from Kira to Jack. Like her, Jack is quite amusing himself and is also stalked by the journalist who is the one providing news from the real world. But contrary to Kira (which makes an appearance), Jack is way more sure of himself and isn't going through mirrors to catch the beast but to open doors that will allow him to ride the car. The story is, as in the first game, very short and not really important.<br><br>The gameplay didn't change a bit from what I've described for the first game. Given the fact that I'm used now to it, it's less frustrating to play this game. However, I'm still not found of it as the items are really hard to find. The graphics didn't change at all. The soundtrack is also very fitting and in that same style of comedy.<br><br>Like for the first one, I'm mixed about the game but less. While I'm used to the gameplay, the story isn't still developed but is saved by the comedy and the journalist that is really trying to find out what's happening. And I've another complaint: the first game was well-translated, here, every accentuated letter  aren't recognized, meaning that there is an encoding problem somewhere.<br><br><b>High Society<\/b><br>The last Snark Busters is perhaps the one with an improved gameplay and with a story that has nothing to do with the rest. Elizabeth isn't on a quest to find the Snark, like Kira and Jack. She's trying to prove her fianc\u00e9's innocence and contrary to the rest of the trilogy, she's only travelling through mirrors to get pictures of the duchess in the next location (where she could have lost her jewel). Besides, you're meeting ghosts in these alternate rooms, ghosts that will give you these precious pictures.<br><br>And these pictures are part of the gameplay: each time, you come back to your laboratory to develop them (which is a minigame in itself, already present in the previous game with Jack). It's the clue to your next location. And for that, you take a taxi. See, no mirror to unlock to travel elsewhere, just mirrors inside the location to go forward. And instead of travelling all around the world, you're staying in the neighboorhood somewhere.<br><br>The gamplay improved in the sense that now, it's easier to find missing objects. They're more obvious. Besides, it's a wheel of items in the scene which is shown, like in  Behind the Refletion 2 in the Hidden Object Bundle 5-in-1 and if I remember well, Fairy Tales Mysteries 2: The Beanstalk. However, contrary the previous game, the items in red, unavailable, can be found in other scenes. Items can be carried over now, though your inventory is reduced to two items. Some puzzles are still present though.<br><br>The style didn't change at all from the previous game. While the soundtrack is still nice, the news are voiced now. Elizabeth herself is speaking though the majority of the dialogues with the ghosts are written and without any voice. The problem with accents are still present for languages using them like French, which is hard to read after a while.<br><br>Snark Busters: High Society isn't my favorite at all. It's not a question of gameplay there but more a question of story. The Snark isn't even in the center of the game. After a while, you can feel yourself lost in the story as you don't always the genious spark of &quot;Oh yeah, there is a bottle in that chest, if I cut it, I can make a funnel!&quot;.<br><br><b>Family Secrets<\/b><br>Read <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/286500\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >my review<\/a><br><br><b>Zoroaster<\/b><br>Read <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vicrabb\/recommended\/302120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >my review<\/a><br><br><b>Serpent Flame<\/b><br>With this story, House of 1000 Doors is now touching to time travel and to other entities\/planets. However, while I loved the storyline (prevent similar fates in the past), I found it a little odd to find Kate in modern clothes (when she was clearly from the '50 in the previous games and during this era too) in a modern world, as if being one of the allies of the House of 1000 Doors make you immortal. The rest is well done. And for the bonus chapter, you're in Raphael's mind (the man that brought you to the mansion).<br><br>The gameplay is still similar to the previous game: find items, use them, solve puzzles and clear hidden objects scenes (with hidden objects in them that you can find either by moving something or by repairing them - albeit there is another type of scenes, where you have to replace items).<br><br>I loved the graphics - even if I'm kind of disappointed to see their liberties with Ancient Rome. I love the contrast with the darkness of the manor and the brightful landscapes. Besides, you get also to know more about Raphael's ancestors in the end. And the soundtrack was really great and fitting. It wasn't the same track as in the previous games.<br><br>This game is as good as the previous ones, though now more oriented to apocalypse and time travelling.<br><br><b>Conclusion<\/b><br>The conclusion is simple: it's the first time that I'm kinda hesitating to recommend you an Alawar bundle (if you make an expection of the Farming one that I didn't purchase). I mean, House of 1000 Doors is really a must-have series BUT you can find two opus as stand-alones or in a bundle. Snark Busters is perhaps good but not as good as the other games proposed, given the gameplay. I had to cut down many portions of this review because of character limit but in the end, this bundle is worthy!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24632979', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24632979' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24632979\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24632979' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24632979\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24632979', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24632979_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24632979_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary27764814\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/katfrog\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"64600147\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60c39ef7e97300fe176810256d8d4f8767a3301b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60c39ef7e97300fe176810256d8d4f8767a3301b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/60c39ef7e97300fe176810256d8d4f8767a3301b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/katfrog\/\" data-miniprofile=\"64600147\">KatFrog<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/katfrog\/games\/?tab=all\">370 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/katfrog\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/katfrog\/recommended\/486810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">38.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 26, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a wonderful bundle for anyone who likes to solve puzzles.  The main type of puzzles are &quot;find the hidden objects&quot; types, but all six games have other games for you to play.  The first three games deal with traveling betweeen the regular and backwards (mirror) worlds while you chase after the legendary Snark.  The last three games focus on the House of 1,000 Doors and the adventures that one Katherine Reed has with it.  You need to play the last three games in order for them to make the most sense.  In the first game, the main character learns about the House.  In the second game, she saves the House and its inhabitants from fire.
