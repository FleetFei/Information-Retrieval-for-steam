Here's my longest review ever. <br><br>First, a description. Defiance is an MMO with a strong single-player plot to get you through quite a few hours. The story is interesting enough and the voice acting is great! This plot acts as an extended introduction to the game world. After that, you will need to find various public happenings (seiges, arkfalls, etc.) in which to help and compete with other players. There are also instances that spawn self-contained worlds. Some of these are PvP, others are cooperative. You also have daily and weekly missions to fulfill. All in all, similar to other MMOs. You get a cool game world and then comes the endless grind. <br><br>The game is very much a glass half-full thing. First, I love the look, which is post-apocalyptic without being too dark and beige. Enemies are varied and interesting. But over the long haul you get used to them. No further mobs have been introduced. (Not strictly the case, but they are variations on the tried and true.)<br><br>Your own character is rendered nicely and you can dress up in different outfits, if that's your thing. Though this consists only of changing two articles of clothing. You start the game by choosing one of four classes and one of four main EGO powers, which becomes your special ability. Over time you fill out other passives, actives, and gain all four EGO powers. Then you are just the same as everyone else. Yep, everyone has the same attributes! The classes don't matter either, and races are purely cosmetic... and look similar enough. As do (most) of the costumes. You can spend real cash on stuff that is just a different colour from what you already have. Ho hum.<br><br>The gunplay is very good. In fact, though I haven't played them all, combat in Defiance is the best of all MMOs. Though it is third-person, it has the feeling of a FPS, which I love. You can get and modify different guns as you go on, though to a large extent there is not much difference between these either. Until you get to end-game, when you can no longer level (increase EGO), the most important thing is the EGO of your gun. Even 100 EGO matters and that's over a scale of 6000. <br><br>The game is free to play, though you will need to spend money. First, buy all the DLC by way of the Season's Pass. Really, once you discover you actually do want to play, just buy this, or you will be restricted in several annoying ways. Besides, then you get to use swords! (Not an optimal strategy and kind of orphaned, but fun anyway.) <br><br>Second, you will need more inventory slots, a lot more. Third, you will need more key capacity, or you will not be able to unlock the better random gear boxes. Overall, however, you won't need to spend too much.<br><br>Several things in Defiance completely suck, the main one being that the number of sucky things has been steadily increasing. So what was a decent and fun game when I started is being squeezed out of existence by Trion. To the point that I will NEVER buy another one of their games. <br><br>OK, let me list the sucky things.<br><br>As mentioned, classes and races DO NOT MATTER. This is not an RPG at all. Which is a wasted opportunity. <br><br>Swords don't matter, they are just fun for a while. Vehicles don't really matter, since they are almost all the same. A lot of guns, likewise. <br><br>Certain in-game currencies that you can get free by playing are practically useless -- you will soon have millions of clams you cannot use on anything. However, the one useful currency, used to upgrade guns (arkforge) has become rare as hen's teeth, almost impossible to grind, so you need to buy it with cash money. At insanely exhorbitant rates. Or not get cool upgraded guns.<br><br>A new fun and highly challenging end-game mode called Expeditions was recently added. But to play you need to spend a brand new currency that you get only in trickles and cannot earn. So you must buy these Hunter Requisitions with cash money. Or not play. It seems that Trion is now gradually introducing features people have asked for for years, like private instances. But you must spend HR to play these! <br><br>PvP sucks and is highly biased towards the higher tier players. But it is a REQUIREMENT to play PvP to build your character to the maximum cap. Some of the other necessary achievements are worse than grinding, since they rely on luck repeated over and over. Or stupid actions no-one would ever want to do. Duels. Turret kills. Driving a big truck. Say no more. <br><br>Doing well in an event and getting high on the leaderboard gets you nothing. Loot is not tied to doing well. Someone might spend 15 minutes grinding and get crap, while someone else who camps and shoots a mob ONCE will get a legendary. I have no idea who thought that was a good idea, but it is an integral part of the game. Really, Defiance is one big gamble and does not reward intelligence or skill.<br><br>And now we have a new rarity (Supreme) that guns can be upgraded to.... by gambling on success, paying arkforge, bought with real money. Unbelievable.<br><br>Defiance could have been so much more. It could have been Godlike!! But stupid punitive decisions on the part of Trion have ruined it. Nonetheless, it's still the MMO with the best combat system, so I play it. <br><br>It's a shame that someone else can't take the exact same engine and build a good game on it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20270968', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20270968' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20270968\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20270968' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20270968\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20270968', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20270968_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20270968_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t659 of 856 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">16 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary7744080\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"67516523\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/85ffb93dde3d2dde684d236e967fedb7e0b1e4f4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/85ffb93dde3d2dde684d236e967fedb7e0b1e4f4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/85ffb93dde3d2dde684d236e967fedb7e0b1e4f4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67516523\">hardy_83<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/games\/?tab=all\">279 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hardy_83\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2,024.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 25, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn short, now that it is F2P it's totally worth at least trying.<br>If you like it, then drop a few bucks to upgrade your account. It's still a solid game and you will most likely enjoy it for what it is.<br>Don't worry about the DLC packs right away.<br>It also uses Rifts F2P model where all major content updates (from here on out) doesn't cost anything, and the store is more vanity\/utility. The first seasons DLC still costs money though.<br>It's not the best looking PC game though. Runs easily though because of that.<br><br><br>While I experienced bugs at the start, I rarely come across them now.<br>Since the game has come back on Steam as F2P, the servers have basically blown up. I have constant connection issues, but the game is free so still try it out. lol<br>The connection issues may anger some people though.<br><br><br>In terms of graphics, it's fine. Clearly the fact that it was also made for incredibly outdated hardware on the consoles PS3 and 360 didn't help at all.<br>It seems up in the air if the PC version will ever get a graphical upgrade, even just HD textures, so don't expect a pretty game by today's standards.<br>SweetFX helps a lot.<br><br><br>For gameplay I think it's actually really good. <br>Looking at PvE it reminds me of Tabula Rasa which I miss SO much, and other third person MMOs like Global Agenda, there hasn't really been an MMO third person shooter with a big persistent world like this since Tabula Rasa.<br>Games like Destiny, Borderlands and others don't have that. So if you like overworlds, that's a plus on this game vs the others.<br>This being pretty much the only one out like that, if you liked the two MMOs I mentioned, you'll like this.<br>It's also similar to Borderlands in terms of getting a constant stream of weapons and how the shooting mechanics work, but Borderlands isn't really an MMO so the similarities end there.<br><br><br>The tie-in with the show is superficial at best right now. Season 2 seems to be the same as well, though the new Silicon Valley content links storyline, oddly enough, from the <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/defiancefew.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >defiancefew.com<\/a> website <br><br><br>The shooting mechanics are good, the powers are good, though more variety of abilities would be nice in the future.<br>You gain &quot;levels&quot; by increasing your EGO rating through achievement-like objectives and just getting &quot;levels&quot;. Due to DLC5 making weapon damage scale to EGO rating now, it's a lot more traditional than it was. However, you can still do all content regardless of EGO rated, and you do get boosted if the difficulty level is higher than you can naturally handle.<br>There is a decent variety of things to do now, with arkfalls, sieges, side quests, story quests, and emergencies.<br>The driving is fun. Just going around the world jumping around on your vehicle, running over enemies can be enjoyable. I really hate the races though, the mechanics are horrible when confined in races.<br>I think the storyline is good, not great, though the cliffhanger is a bit lame.<br><br>The games chat works more or less like a traditional chat in an MMO now.<br>However, this game also has a pathetically low amount of social interaction compared to other MMOs.<br>No AH or mail system either.<br><br>For PvP howerver, I would look elsewhere.<br>It's been my stance that any MMO with a PvE overworld and instanced PvP will just never have good PvP. It's impossible to balance, and never will be.<br>If they had just stuck with Shadow Wars (which is fun) and open world PvP, it would've been a lot better, but since it has instanced PvP, there's better games. TF2 is one I can think of off the top of my head and it's free.<br><br>There is an in-game shop. Most of the stuff is vanity. Overpriced vanity at that.<br>Also in the shop is lock-boxes that can get you weapons and mods, but you don't really need to buy them with cash (they are REALLY overpriced anyways, like $5 a box). <br>You can also get most of the lockboxes in-game with the games currency.<br>There's bag space, I suppose that might be needed for some, but it's not pay to win.<br><br>However I think the biggest selling point is it's F2P. It's hard not to recommend at least trying it at that price. Especially with no monthly fee and nothing from the overpriced in-game shop item being &quot;necessary&quot;, you can definitely get your moneys worth, and it's also easy to go back to if you stop playing for a long period of time.<br>I can't really recommend the DLC Season Pass (unless it's on sale for $20, then get it) or packs though, unless you really enjoy the game and want to throw a bit more money at the developer.<br>Not because I think the DLC is bad per say, but that I'm not a fan of the season pass system in this industry.<br><br><br>DLC1 Review: DLC1 includes a small quest chain and 5 arenas, in which you go instead and basically just shoot a bunch of mobs for gear and rep.<br>The reputation vendors sells a series of &quot;charge&quot; weapons, which are weapons you hold the shot button to charge up, and an energy sword which are basically lightsabers.<br>You can also co-op the arenas now, so if you like doing instances with friends, it might be worth it.<br><br><br>DLC2 Review: is far superior to DLC1. The arkbreaks you can call down are pretty fun to do, and there's always people doing them (though recently, it's died down a little due to loot reward issues). <br>Even if you don't own the DLC, which would prohibit you from using the new weapons, it's still a good update.<br><br>You also get daily\/weekly rewards which includes money, resources and a &quot;battery&quot; that you use to call down the arkbreak arkfalls.<br>There's also a small quest chain that explains the new stims and boost systems, as well as a small story quest that gets into the arkbreak system.<br>It also lets you equip all the new weapons that drop within arkbreaks. Non-DLC owners can't use them.<br>I'd say DLC2 is worth buying.<br><br><br>DLC3 Review: Pass.<br>What you receive for owning this is a samurai outfit, two new blue weapons (a sniper and shotgun) and a title.<br>You also get access to a new vendor and daily\/weekly contracts for a new faction.<br>That's it. There's no quests and everything else with the update you can get for free.<br>It's the worst DLC of the five, so you really aren't missing much if you don't get it.<br>The incursion event weapons are tied to this DLC FYI.<br><br><br>DLC4: I think it was pretty good. There's no new faction but a new lockbox tied to an already existing reputation.<br>There's a bunch of new story missions which I find good enough, considering how starved this game is for new story.<br>There's 9 new arenas, which can be done co-op, which are okay. I can see them being fun, but I personally don't care for them<br>Owning the DLC gets you access to the new quests, one of the new lockboxes and a title. I think this is slightly better than DLC2, so it is the best so far.<br><br><br>DLC5: Get it if you want some Arkforge for altering gear. You get 1k and some other stuff, so worth it if you want that.<br><br><br>With the F2P transition, some of the new TV\/Game tie-in missions have had the voice actors for the some of the NPCs change. It's by no means horrible, but you will notice and it is pretty jarring, though the updates are free so I can't complain that much.<br><br>In terms of how the store works, it's basically the same as it was when it was B2P. The game takes Rifts model as opposed to say LOTRO or Secret World where content updates cost money. All Defiance content updates will be free.<br>There is, what I find funny, a &quot;subscription&quot; option now in the shop. Which gives you various passive boosts to things like XP\/Skill etc, as well as a 10% discount in the store.<br>I find it funny because the game was B2P with no sub option prior to F2P. It's the first F2P transition I'm aware of where a sub option gets added to the game.<br>Is the patron status worth it? That's up to you.

This game opened me up to Third Person shooters and now I'm always looking for the next one to check out.  The open world may not be as big as some traditional MMO's but it's pretty huge and there is a LOT to do.  It looks great, the combat feels solid, and the variety of weapon choices make it easy to jump in and start playing.  <br><br>One issue that I've had with this game are the balance between vastly different leveled players fighting in close proximity, they have a system to balance things out, but it never seemed to work too well, leaving the lower level player (who may be in the middle of a story mission) running for his\/her life instead of fighting on a level playing field.  <br><br>The other issue is endgame content.  The game truly is classless, the class you choose lasts you a good hour at most, then everyone can do everything as they level, but once you max out your skill grid and finish the majority of your persuits, there's not much else to do.  There's really only one tough endgame boss, the Volge Warmaster, and the developers have such a problem figuring out how hard he should be programmed to be that sometimes he's almost completely unkillable, sometimes he's a joke.<br><br>Complaints aside, I enjoyed the story.  I enjoy the combat and the ability to just run out there and kill things.  The random events that pop up on the map and the co-op missions are fun enough to keep you playing... And the game really does look and sound great.  <br><br>Definitely recommended even amidst it's faults.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12694712', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12694712' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12694712\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12694712' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12694712\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12694712', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12694712_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12694712_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t478 of 674 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">14 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10835198\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"67540087\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64de425df359a788b0473a1f6a9f2cff4e47bce6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64de425df359a788b0473a1f6a9f2cff4e47bce6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/64\/64de425df359a788b0473a1f6a9f2cff4e47bce6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67540087\">CinemaFromage<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/games\/?tab=all\">636 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/recommended\/\">60 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CinemaFromage\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 26, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDefiance feels like the ultimate tourist MMO.   <br><br>It starts out with seeing the show on TV with the built in commercials.  &quot;Hey, that place looks shiny and neat!  Looks fun, we should visit!&quot;  <br><br>Then you buy your tickets, take the flight and arrive.  You wander gawking at everything with wide innocent eyes, having zero clue what the hell is going on, but man it looks cool!  <br><br>After a while, you get tired of sightseeing, so you suck it up and decide to dip your toe into the pool, test the waters.  You grab what looks like a quest, studying the map for a minute, make a vague guess as to where you're supposed to go.  You hope on your rented ATV and head out across the country side. <br><br>As you're riding, you run into what you think are locals.  They're mean and grumpy; they call you names and are zero help.  <br><br>You put up with the angry locals for a day or two as you try and find your way around.  Eventually, you *think* you have a general idea of how the quest system works; you how know how to get to one or two key locations in town.  You know how to avoid the dangerous locals; you stick to the mildly annoying ones.  How you're having some fun getting into minor fire fights, picking up bits and pieces of armor and weapons as souvenirs.  You're amused, you're satisfied. <br><br>Next thing you know, a week has passed.  You're bored with going back and forth to town and the sections you're familiar with.  Branching out to new areas feels like too much work.  It's been a week; you've had your fun.

But those bugs are all but squashed now and the game is really solid. <br><br>It's like a mix of swtor, and borderlands 2. The way the area's are created has a Swtor feel, and your running around shootings things much like Borderlands, or so I hear. (I never actually played either Borderlands, but that's how people are describing it). <br><br>With only a few hours of game-play in it, I'm already getting my 10$ worth out of it easy, and the game story will draw you in. The characters personalities seem pretty solid as well, you'll hate them, love them, and get annoyed by the ones your supposed too. <br><br>Ontop of that, the customization for your character is pretty legit as well, not only being able to choose which weapon and side arm you want, (which is no limitations, you could go sniper rifle\/Assault Weapon Sniper Rifle\/Bazooka, Pistol\/Energy Gun, or even Shotgun\/Shotgun) No limitations in mix and matching weapons. <br><br>Just like Swtor you can break down your weapons as well for parts and income, or add accessories and mods to them which will boost their ability, as well as change your characters headgear, and outfit to mix and match. <br><br>Definetly worth the 10$ easy.<br><br>Cons: <br><br>The few Con's I found are not huge, but could be a turn off for some players. <br><br>1) The starting area's at least are pretty empty. To me this actually enhances the feel of it being a wasteland. If there were 100's of people running around, wouldn't feel like that, so to me this is actually a plus, but for others may be a turn off. There is a helpful automatic party finder however, which helps to get groups. <br><br>2) The Chat system is totally implimented bad. You can never see what anyone is saying around you or in the area. To see it, you have to stop what your doing and press Enter. Which then a Chat screen the size of the entire screen pops up. Which only then can you respond. Terrible chat system for an action game, because half way through responding to what your friend just said your getting shot at, and need to stop. <br><br>However if you use VOIP to talk with friends, again, the chat system is of no concern for you really.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8650309', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8650309' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8650309\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8650309' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8650309\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8650309', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8650309_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8650309_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t81 of 112 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12386051\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11838442\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46ebd8c943858706459dfa50925badd97fa8ce4a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46ebd8c943858706459dfa50925badd97fa8ce4a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/46ebd8c943858706459dfa50925badd97fa8ce4a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11838442\">Agent Werewolf<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/games\/?tab=all\">202 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197972104170\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">49.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 6, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen Defiance released, I had a look at some videos on Youtube including Angry Joes Review and thought, &quot;another MMO ready for FTP in 12 months&quot;.<br><br>On the bright side I was right, Im now playing it because it is now FTP as predicted. I have not watched the TV show because it looks pretty lame, but if its as good as the game, I might eat my words twice. Because this game is FUN!!<br><br>I have played over 45 hours in about 7 days since installing it. Its just a blast, you can ride a quad bike off a cliff, land on enemies and get kill points, barrel roll off the quad and start shooting while your still rolling. Its crazy, its brash, its got so many explosions your ears hurt and I LOVE IT!<br><br>It reminds me a great deal of City of Heroes. I played about 18 months of CoH when it released. I played a normal gun toter just to be different and my game experience in CoH was pretty similar to Definace. The graphics are cartoonish but appropriate, they represent the world in a way that is suitable for the type of game and the way the action plays out. Sounds are good, the music is ok but can get repetetive.<br><br>The range of guns and weapons is pretty staggeering and when you consider most guns have 4 modification slots and improvements to gain through mastering them, there is a massive amount of customisation. You can get a grenade launcher and give it rapid fire, incendiary and low recoil for example, its like a tennis ball shooter using fire grenades, its just MAD. There are assault rifles, pistols, auto and bolt sniper rifles etc etc etc, they all feel differrent and change appearance, feel and sound when you mod them.<br><br>Missions are easy to find and plentiful. So far the best gear I have got has come from solo missions which provides incentive to keep doing them. The story line is acceptable and even good for an MMO.<br><br>The community is happy, helpful and firendly. Coop missions are available but can be hard to get going because the open world play is so much fun and so varied, people just dont seem to play the zone missions much. PVP is optional and easy to join in. But keep in mind the game has been going 12 months so you can run into some badass hombres. I was shooting one guy in the head point blank as he lay on the ground sniping and he basically ignored me for the first 4 shots lol, then got up and one shotted me.... but thats the life of a noob right?<br><br>The most fun I have had so far has been from the random events that happen a few times a day. Players seem to rush from all over to join in and even at low levels you can do some damage and get some good rewards while fighting massive exciting enemies in crazy open world combat.<br><br>I am pretty impressed with Definace and I think like many MMOs it let itself down by releasing 6 months too early. If the product I am playing was the one that hit the market, Im sure it would have scored better.<br><br>On the down side, lag can be chronic at times, but daily server re-boots fix it, so its often a matter of timing as to how much lag you suffer. You hear lots of people complaining about it on chat so I know its not just me. Server reboots seem to be around 7pm AEST but can vary.<br><br>I recommend you give this one a go, I will be playing it for some time I reckon. Its nice to see a game that remembers games are meant to be fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12386051', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12386051' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12386051\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12386051' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12386051\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12386051', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12386051_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12386051_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t114 of 167 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11777990\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"73625852\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/5501a40ccdf0fad06e0f3ace651b245b3d9acb17.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/5501a40ccdf0fad06e0f3ace651b245b3d9acb17.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/5501a40ccdf0fad06e0f3ace651b245b3d9acb17_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73625852\">-{Geo}- Cegorach<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/games\/?tab=all\">475 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/recommended\/\">29 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Xelluse\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">299.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 19, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t- I'll start from one of important mistakes I see in Defiance game Reviews - &quot;Similar to&quot;. Game is not Similar to any other game in same genre, but it can remind many games you see before - Borderlands, Saints Row, BF, WH 40k atc... Also game is not standard and stamped MMORPG, don't wait Elves or Orcs here, it's Post Apocalyptic Earth, where is chaos and destruction.<br>- Now will say about its gameplay - as I say game have nothing from standard RPG-TPSs, you don't have Classes here and not stuck to specific gameplay, shortly game isn't forcing you to play stumped class with stamped weapon, you are absolutely free in how, why and where to do, you can use any weapon, skill, so you are building your own gameplay, what is also very important and good for me, you are free to go and do what ever you want in Defiance world, also world is living its life and aggressively opposed against you, you have too many ways to progress your character and gameplay, sometimes it's confusing, but if you understand Defiance World it will become fun and easy.<br>- Game is very specific in many ways, many things here are not explained from the beginning and new players can easily lost in Defiance world, but don't afraid, here is impossible to destroy gameplay, just do story and main quests and many things will become understandable for you. Defiance have very active and fun PvE and PvP content, in PvE you can move as solo same with friends and clan, on low levels much easier to do missions in solo because as more players are in same zone then harder is to kill enemies there for low levels, but moving in group will increase loot and fun, PvP content is very interesting, but feels unfinished yet, also DLC content makes it little unbalanced, if you are good TPS player you may not feel this,but if you are not &quot;Pro&quot; then you feel pain sometimes, especially on low, mid levels, DLCs give quite good shields, weapons and perks that in PvP are not OP, but gives not bad advantage to its owners in 1vs1 battles, but all battles are more massive than solo, also PvP here got many tactical nuances (they feel unfinished, but not bad for PvE oriented game), so it's not so big problem. It's not P2W, but with DLCs you will feel more comfortable with them more than without, but game is PvE oriented, so PvP here is like in many other PvE games, but quite fun as I say before.<br>(*I used word &quot;level&quot; cos it's more understandable for new players, here is no level system, Defiance have progressing system called EGO Rating, which can remind leveling one, but is quite different thing)<br><br>- Bad things I found here are : 1. side DRM and not best protected for now. 2. Game is forcing much to purchase Packs and DLCs what is quite bad thing for F2P games especially when game have no economical part at all, you can trade but it's useless here, its more forcing you to buy things you need, more then things you like to buy, in many F2P games you can purchase things in Cash and sell them to other players, so if some one didn't spend money, but spend time to farm he can help you to force your farm in exchange for the things you purchased for cash, so you get things you were interested in and he gets thing he was interested in. Or Cash exchanging system with other players which is becoming more and more popular nowadays and brings much more balance and fairness in game economy and gameplay, but trading with players is useless here, cos they can't use any content they didn't pay for and many of purchased things are untradeable, many games nowadays giving trading system when F2P players are working on PP players, what is way comfortable as for players who spend money same for players who didn't or can't and server got as money same massive amount of players what is very important for MMO games and makes them much more fun and interesting (game can't MMO &quot;Massive Multiplayer Online&quot; when it don't have mass), but for now Defiance don't have any kind of economical part and because of this game probably will lose massive amount of players on EGO Rating 5000-5400+ in &quot;endgame&quot;. 3. You can't use Steam wallet to purchase in game items, content. 4. Still have bugs like, Mobs hiding in textures and server drops. 5. Game at the &quot;Endgame&quot; (high levels - high EGO rating) is becoming quite repetitive cos here still is not much high level content, it's more harder version of low level ones, you will repeat things that you already did on low levels, but on harder difficulty. Also can say that Developers are working much and fixing many problems and bugs one by one, also adding much of fun content, so it's not very good for now, but still is very fun and I'm sure that soon time by time Developers will bring much more fun, various and hope balanced content in, but for now it feels like they are creating Single player game more then MMO from Defiance economical system, which is not good for the game, I think, cos nowadays MMO economy is much more flexible then just DLCs.<br><br>- Good things I like here : 1. Game is very flexible and gives lots of freedom if compare to many other MMOTPS-RPGs. 2. Quite cleaver AI that is very rare nowadays, they are not waiting when you will kill them as in modern FPS or TPS games. Also world here is living its own life what gives Defiance very specific atmosphere and makes it quite interesting. 3. You are not tied to specific Class and to its Weapon, you are mixing your gameplay and you are free in your strategy, you can change your play style in any second and play as you wish and not as Class specification forces you. 4. For F2P game with DLC system it is not P2W, but gives many interesting things that you will not care much about in PvP. 5. Very atmospheric for Post-Apocalyptic game, you will feel yourself in really destructed world and not in paradise. 6. Very easy interface with many possible tactical and role-playing styles, in RPGs for me it's one of very important things when you are not playing on Piano, but still have many possible steps to do, console interface for some PC gamers may become confusing in the beginning, but very soon it will become quite comfortable and easy to use. 7. Game hardness is quite interesting thing here - it's same time hard and easy, as I say AI is quite cleaver here, they are trying to surround you, hide behind object, always move and do any thing that will make them hard targets and they are trying every thing to make from you an easy target for them, also AI quite often working in groups and very cohesively, that makes game very fun and not so easy as many modern games. 8. Story line... Never thought that I will be so steeped in MMO games storyline and quests.<br><br>- All written here are my opinions and feelings about Defiance, there are many things that I like and many things I don't, so I tried with my not best English (sorry for that) to explain my opinions about it, of course someone will agree and some one will not, but in last part I really can say that I Recommend this game, it becomes F2P so trying it is best way to understand you will like it or not, game is very specific in many ways and it make many players to love it and many to hate it, I like this game very much and still having lots of fun from it, there are many things to do and to have fun, also it's not stamped-standard MMORPG. It looks for now as modern gaming experiment, but in my feeling it's still experiment more and not finished product yet, but it have very big potential and I'm sure it can become really epic game, if Developers will work more on it, but despite this, game in this version is very, VERY FUN.<br>- Not best, but not bad graphics and amazing atmosphere - 7\/10, free and very flexible gameplay for MMORPG - 9\/10, fun and various game modes - 7\/10, sound and music - 9\/10, controls - 8\/10, AI - 9\/10, progressing - 8\/10, story - 9\/10, Total - 8\/10. So, I recommend it, try it,  but don't be hurry with your opinion, give Defiance some hours and start with main quests and then criticize it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11777990', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11777990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11777990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11777990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11777990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11777990', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11777990_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11777990_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t115 of 170 people (68%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary8444471\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"1200105\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bd\/bd52c0f743b214e8554e4257a487d5283b401cf4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bd\/bd52c0f743b214e8554e4257a487d5283b401cf4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bd\/bd52c0f743b214e8554e4257a487d5283b401cf4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"1200105\">Fomdoo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/games\/?tab=all\">752 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Fomdoo\/recommended\/224600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">137.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 30, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery fun for little money.
