Game looks and plays better overall, there are new visuals and existing artwork is improved. The units are rebalanced, single-player AI is improved and the mechanics now display added functionality. Battlefields and maps are enhanced. Multiplayer system, account creation and networking are upgraded and considerably more stable. There are added Steam achievements, Steam Cloud functionality and soon-to-be-implemented Steam trading cards.\u201d<br><br>The product has a cozy boardgame feel to it, and most strategy gamers will have little need for the online manual, except perhaps to check some of the Siege rules in the game. Movement and combat is reminiscent of Panzer Corps (PC), with a few differences. First, there is no defensive support from adjacent units like artillery or AT in PC. What I\u2019ve always disliked about PC is the numerical (1-15) representation of unit strengths. In MB, strength is based on a percentage of 1-100, so there is more variability in combat losses. Also, there are no combat predictions to hold your hand, as in PC.<br><br>Although the game is simple and straightforward, there are fortunately plenty of options to extend replayability. English, French and Vikings with 9 different units \u2013 although not dramatically different performance-wise. Also, each of the 9 buildings that construct units can be upgraded twice. So theoretically, one player can have 27 units with slightly different stats on the game board at one time. Swordsmen, Halberdiers, Crossbowmen, Knights, Archers, etc. must be used as historically. It is possible to compare your unit\u2019s stats with a competitor\u2019s to determine what bonuses will be in effect before combat.<br><br>\u201cFast-paced\u201d is a good description of the gameplay, and the designers fortunately chose TBS rather than RTS. Players must decide whether to go for villages, farms and other structures which will gain them income or capture the opponent(s) castles(s) while defending their own. There are fortification bonuses available and castles can also be recaptured by their original owners.<br><br>There is no fog of war, in part because it would cause AI scripting to be infinitely more complex, if not impossible. Instead, the AI(s) zero in on enemy castles first, bonus hexes second, and vulnerable enemy units third. This simplification makes for a much tougher artificial opponent. I watched two AIs play on a tiny map for almost 10 minutes before one finally got the upper hand. I believe this illustrates that the AI rarely makes mistakes.<br><br>There are 26 maps available from 8x8 up to one 24x24 monster. The 16x16 maps are ideal, and up to 8 players or AIs can take each slot and starting location. Depending on the set-up, this \u201csimple\u201d game can get quite complex with numerous armies vying for position and the battle constantly swaying back and forth. Larger games are most enjoyable and present the most challenge. Multiplayer would add further complexity, although as a single-player gamer, I did not attempt to start an MP game and cannot comment on the health of the lobby, etc.<br><br>I encountered no bugs or crashes, but I never had a problem with the older version either. What I would wish for most in a patch is more 24x24 maps and\/or a map generator. Fortunately, there is a good variety of 16x16, but hey, we could use a few more.<br><br>Even with the intense competition among other $10 games on Steam, I feel a price of $8 to $12 is fair for this title. A $5 sale may come one day, but for now that would simply be unfair to the developer based on what has been created in the Black Edition.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23407403', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23407403' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23407403\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23407403' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23407403\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23407403', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23407403_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23407403_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/recommended\/459040\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24766720\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"85828157\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/73\/73c0d4f1e7fbf51054df474636344895204c2eb5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85828157\">TheDragonsNiche<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/games\/?tab=all\">596 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/recommended\/\">47 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Oldschool1993159\/recommended\/459040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Medieval Battlefields - Black Edition for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Summary\/Overview<\/div>    <i>Medieval Battlefields- Black Edition<\/i> is an old-school, turn-based medieval strategy game that has been updated from the original. The updated edition holsters new features under its belt along with some new game modes I presume. You play as one of three different medieval factions, either the French noblemen, English court or the Vikings. According to history, the Vikings and English were at war, then the French and English along with the Vikings and English. Everybody in the medieval era hated the Vikings because they were ruthless, showed no mercy and came in conquest to take land, gold, wealth and treasures as they stole and plundered from others and beseeched them earnestly. The main weapon of offensive units were marauders that would come in with incredible force infiltrating the whole offensive line. The main weakness in <i>Medieval Battlefields<\/i> for the Vikings are their long-range artillery and of course calvary that dies off quickly. The French succeeded because of their defensive stance, positions they took on the defensive line and their choice of using reinforced armor made out of better materials. The English were your primary long-distance dealers and in this game they succeed by using spears and bows. <br><br>    <div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics and mechanics)<\/div><br>   <b> Features<\/b><br><br><b>Game Modes<\/b><br>    Three current game modes exist, campaign, skirmishes and the hotseat. I stuck with the campaign through this playthrough to test out the game and take a test drive in it. <br><b>Campaign<\/b><br>    Each different faction has both their strengths and weaknesses, however what stays consistent throughout the whole game is mostly the type of buildings that are built. There are garrisons, barracks, horse stables, a blacksmith to craft your weapons; upgrading your weapons, crafting armor, upgrading armor, the church to recruit priests of the court to fight beside you giving an incredible bonus to all your adjacent units, a war school for research and new and improved weapons, a marketplace to increase gold per turn, iron gates to strengthen protection of your castle and finally the weapon store providing better supply during sieging castles.<br> <br>    <b>Turn-Based Strategy Combat<\/b><br>    The turn-based strategy combat makes this game very simple. Imagine that you are playing either chess or checkers with someone online or against the computer. This is exactly how the combat is stationed, you get the chance to move your units and to upgrade your units, buildings and defenses once per turn. Once you are done with your turn, you click on the hourglass on the lower right of your screen to end your turn, then the opposing faction attacks on you while you try your best to defend. There is no way to block or defend yourself against the opposing faction. You simply must rely on upgrading to better weapons, better materials those weapons are made out of and better armor for all of your defenses. It is very simple, maybe even too simple with no advanced learning curve. However, considering the original reflects the more old-school style of strategy games such as <i>Sid Meier's Civilization III<\/i>, this is allowed and shows subordination towards it as a precursor. <br><br>    Likewise, of chess, you want to keep your distance away from your enemies. I recommend using archers first after hiring a blacksmith if you are the English, however, the Vikings don't do nearly enough damage at all upon the French due to their incredible armor made of steel and higher amendable quality. Thus for Vikings, you are going to have to rely on Marauders and hope you can eventually upgrade to a unit called the battering ram in order to do some excessive damage and capture all of their buildings, their control points.<br><br>   <b> Classic Grid Based Battlefield System<\/b><br>    You move along a grid allowing room for your units to be facing diagonally, adjacent to one another, side-by-side, backed up from a defensive standpoint and also spread out. This works very well and is a nice addiction towards the simplicity.<br><br>    <b>Controls<\/b><br>    The controls utilize basic double-clicking of the mouse from area to area. If you want to get closer to the castle, all you do is first double-click on your unit and then move forward which is followed by catch phrases like, &quot; Yes my lord&quot; and others. All in all, for the most part as long as you know what you are doing they are responsive.<br><br>   <b> Graphics<\/b><br>    While the graphics are not mind-blowing they don't need to be. The graphics remind me of another game, <i>Sid Meier's Civilization III complete<\/i> which is fine and nice. The graphics are simple yet elegant with just the right colors to bring the grid battlefield system and turn-based combat to life in color. That is all that is really needed without including any special bells and whistles along the way of more modern grand-scale based strategy games such as the newer <i>Civilization<\/i> games and one of the most renown PC title series, <i>Europa Universalis<\/i>. The textures and graphic scale of pixels is not meant to be as intense and heavy under load such as the Civilization series which I can appreciate due to the change of pace from a complex steep learning curve in more grand-scale strategy games to pure simplicity in turn-based ones that never make the game more complicated than a game of chess and checkers.<br>    <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Positive &amp; Negative Aspects<\/div><br>Advantageous Implementations<br><br>\u2022An excellent balance between creating the right units based upon the opposing factions you face against<br>\u2022An incredible array of different music that is orchestrative in bringing the Medieval era as a whole to life<br>\u2022A good update to the original game<br>\u2022Simplicity makes the cut, being empathetic upon the feelings, values and beliefs of people within the strategy genre<br>\u2022Nice text based layout of text without overdoing it once you survive a mission and capture the opposing team's resources, buildings and castle<br>\u2022I sincerely hope that this game appeals to a much wider audience of people [\/h1]<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Primary Concerns<\/div><br>\u2022It takes time, patience and the ability to know and to recognize instantaneously the weakness and strengths of your opponents<br><br>\u2022Lack of more graphical settings and options in which we can all deal with but it would be nice to be able to modify it some<br><br>\u2022I would have liked it to have some tutorial, especially good for those like me that decided in the latter part of the summer to start getting into the strategy genre as a newer genre I play. Knowing nothing about strategy myself and the simplicity of this game with carefully timed attacks and chess based strategy, I am led to take careful notes upon all weaknesses of my army and use all my strengths earlier on in the beginning to my advantage.<br><br><br>\u2022There is a tutorial only for game help for those that have never played. While it does educate you on the gameplay and mechanics, I still would of liked to see one match in which the computer shows you examples in different situations of unit placement and the times in which you should advance and other instances in which you should retract. <br><br><b>Overall 7<\/b><br>Key<br>1-3= poor<br>4-5= ok<br>6-7 = good<br>8-10 = amazing<br><br>I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.
