Not easy, but doable and you have to play smart and you'll progress but there is still the chance you might blow it and &quot;lose.&quot; Amazing game, not simple or short in my opinion by any means. A full-blown challenging and tense game, of which I am fully satisfied as long-time gamer who has completed many classics rpg\/adventure and strategy games and this is one of the most memorable ones! This developer has my allegiance for future games. <br><br>-----<br><br>UPDATE #2: 9 hours in... I have completed the second part (by the skin of my teeth, I thought it was game over but didn't give up and just made it). JUST when I thought the game would be over... WOW.. onto another part 3. It's pretty safe to say at this point, this game has tons of content. and edge-of-your-seat playability. In 1995 if this game came out it would have cost $50- and been hailed as a  classic MASTERPIECE today. In relation to gaming design, mechanics etc for a super-intelligent procedural strategy\/action\/adventure this is certified CONTEMPORARY MASTERPIECE as well. I know I am being redundant, but after playing through a significant portion of the game, this goes directly on my top-10 favorite games list of all-time. I will be flabbergasted if in a year from now, many other people who actually play the whole game won't feel the same. Top marks.<br><br>-----<br><br>UPDATE: 4 hours in... I am leaving my initial impressions review but I would like to add here that: I have reached &quot;part 2&quot; of the game scenario finally.. where you reach 'the first expedition space craft.' There's more content and cool things than initially expected (Just built the lunar rover and generation capsule, cashed in my points from part 1 to get a surveillance camera..) .<br><br>The game construction is clear to me and all I have to say as after 30+ years of gaming and still being a fan of turn-based action\/strategy\/adventure - in my discerning eyes this game rocks and is A MASTERPIECE. So much potential for so much scenario expansion but for what is here - is awesome and well-made, easy to play after spending a good hour. Definitely a favorite in my &quot;best games of all-time&quot; list, spanning the c64 to early-mid 90s PC gaming to modern gaming, especially relating to perfect, improved classic retro genre style games.<br><br>F YEA. One of the best games of the past 20 years and all-time absolutely. And I hope this is just the dawning for this developer and their Planet in the Shadows.<br><br>-----<br><br>NOTE: The below review is a couple days after the initial, official release AND my impressions from a few hours of playing. I am impressed and like it even only after my first 10-12 game sessions of playing.<br><br>Superb - finally a solid turn-based lightweight strategy + luck (procedural map, creatures, etc) + rogue-like game. Good concept, design, replayability, evoking a lighter C64-ish\/early PC\/Flash loose variant perhaps of something like project firestart (C64); X-com (early PC); Motherload (flash mining game) in feel and simple gameplay. I am a gamer from the days of Atari thru c64 thru 90s PC to a current player of the more contemporary retro\/pixel scene games looking for turn-based games of this type. There have really not been many (and good ones) out there as far as new games on contemporary platforms, going back over the past 20 years!<br><br>* LINUX-USERS: Game works fine in PlayOnLinux - simple default steam install environment, and will should run with no issue or effect on old systems concerning cpu-usage.<br><br>* GOOD DESIGN FOR CHALLENGING GAMES: Takes advantage of simple procedural design to spawn new but small maps, I assume to facilitate the end-goal task in a timely manner. From the dev response on the steam discussion thread, a skilled uber-geek gamer may be able beat the scenario in 2 hours. (Me: maybe 25-50 tries if lucky, or many hours).<br><br>* REPLAYABILITY: However, in regard to above, it's procedural so sort of a pseudo-puzzler\/turned-based action game you will can replay over-and-over again. You may win an odd game session, you will probably end up quiting an impossibly difficult game, restarting, etc. I can only speculate as I justed started playing but I assume it is possible to win each game (?), but if you're like me, I know when I'm licked, and if so I will gladly restart a new game. I have spent a couple hours already (not close to beating it) and when I do finally beat it (who knows, as mentioned previously, I expect more like 15 hours or 50 tries), it's not like a crappy movie where you'll never watch it or play it again. By design this game is meant to play until you beat and then revisit now-or-later.<br><br>* TURN-BASED MAGIC: I have little time to play games or get that involved at this point in my life, but I do revel and really appreciate simple turn-based strategy or thoughtful game designs in the modern era of games. There is HUGE LACK OF TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES TODAY.<br><br>* RETRO-ENTHUSIASTS: good atmosphere, graphics and music evoking an authentic experience, with simple but stellar gameplay, offering -\/+ scoring and fat-trimmed replayability.<br><br>* POSSIBILITY OF EXPANSION? It would be great though to have the game expanded for example either sequel\/episode\/level\/scenario-wise where the developer could implement, balance and package additional scenarios or even another release, OR expand\/update the game here in some way with even more content or options. I really think it is worth it.<br><br>* MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE TRAILER (INSTRUCTIONAL): The game once you actually understand clearly what you need to do (build a walled enclosures and then the radar AND survive), May come off not only lightweight in cpu-usage but it also in regards to a small world size\/map and content\/objective. But it in a nutshell it is a hybrid game meant for procedural replayability.<br><br>* WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN THIS TYPE OF GAME TO GAIN MOMENTUM AND BE EXPANDED AND BUILT FURTHER ON (FOR SUPPORTERS LIKE ME!) AS THE STEAM PLATFORM CAN ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. First impression may be for some people that it's too small or simple (ps. difficult options are present, and easy seems hard enough to me), but that is besides the point and of the challenge and design of the game. BUT I would hardly complain and wish there will be expansion or some kind of sequel. But as it is, I am very glad to have this in my game library and will be a game that I will pop in my disk drive for awhile to come! Well worth the affordable, full initial price. Well done.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22526715', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22526715' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22526715\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22526715' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22526715\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22526715', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22526715_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22526715_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22462163\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198208240331\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"247974603\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198208240331\/\" data-miniprofile=\"247974603\">konovod<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198208240331\/games\/?tab=all\">5 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198208240331\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198208240331\/recommended\/448820\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've played an alpha-version and it was fun, but the released version is much better. Managing items become easier, balance is better, even iridium isn't useless now. And there is an impossible mode for seasoned players!<br><br>The most funny part in the game is the player's base. The feel of comfort when huge alien slimes are eating the walls radiating poisonous shine through them, but you know that your walls are strong enough to sustain a &quot;night&quot;. Careful planning the base to minimize usage of titan, then replanning it after seeing where most monsters hit, then replanning it again after seeing that stupid rover doesn't fit the room. Morning runs after anabiosis to boom all fauna crawling around and fill the holes of external perimeter.<br><br>Second nice part - outside world. It isn't just hostile - it's alien. You can't just kill everything at sight (even though there will be a lot of explosions) - you have to learn the rules of this world to survive. And there are huge molds. They are highly radioactive and after so much deaths it is horrible just see them on the screen, but for a rare materials you have to come pretty close to them.<br><br>The last thing I want to point out - progression. The game shows you basic mechanics and recipes, and you think that it's not very complex but funny little game, but then second stage comes, with more resources, recipes and mechanics. When you visited a huge molds at corners you think that now you know all - there appears a rover that adds another side to the world.
