They don't provide any situations you can't mostly make yourself by picking a standard driver and track, but as a suggestion to jog one's interest, it works decently well, and if you either watched the 2016 season or are looking to get into it, this has some fan appeal in that regard.<br><br>Upset Central is a very standard race at Pocono, except recreating Chris Buescher's win at the 2016 Pennsylvania 400. The fog gave him that one, but as there's no weather effects in this game, you play a what-if scenario as him where the weather remains clear and you still have to win. Nothing's different here from a normal race at Pocono, though.<br><br>Fun at the 301 sees you playing the 2016 New Hampshire 301 not as Matt Kenseth, who actually won it, but as Tony Stewart, who took second place. It tasks you with instead taking the win yourself. Kenseth will absolutely fight you for it, though, so the one change here is really the ferocity and aggression of the AI.<br><br>Leading Larson recreates Kyle Larson's first Sprint Cup win, edging past Chase Elliott at the 2016 Pure Michigan 400. Larson and Elliott were two of the absolute most fascinating drivers this year and had some incredibly heated competition, including one of the closest, fiercest finishes ever, so this pits the two against each other in a one-on-one duel. As far as fanservice and rule of cool goes, that is awesome. As far as game design goes, though, that was a very bad idea, because you can just slam into Chase once to spin him out and then coast home to a free victory.<br><br>Ready, Set, Restart sees you as Kevin Harvick at Indianapolis in 2016, but instead of placing sixth, you're charged with taking the lead home from the five drivers that placed ahead of him. It's a standard Indianapolis race, though, again, the top five are going to fight you hard for position.<br><br>All in all, a few amusing what-if scenarios based on what really happened in the season depicted in the game. They'll make for more interesting historical footnotes further into the future, I'm sure, and I'd personally have preferred the DLC stick to cosmetic things instead of paid scenarios that just re-arrange what's already in the game, but it passed a bit of time and put a smile on my face, so this was a fine thing to receive.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28737533', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28737533' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28737533\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28737533' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28737533\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28737533', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28737533_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28737533_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28737533"]}
