Having finally bit the bullet and bought this in a sale I can genuinely say I enjoyed the new features it brought in.<br><br>My style of play is mostly to take an established petty kingdom and expand it as much as I can, so can't really comment on the impact it has if playing a lower ranking character. <br><br>The council adds a new political challange to take into consideration, and means you have to box clever when making big decisions that affect your dynasty. You either need to pick your council wisely, bribe your way through, or play a political game to maximise your favour generation. The addition of the favours mechanic balances this perfectly, council members will not hesitate to cash in their favours, and it will almost certainly not be to your favour... These can push your game in new and unexpected directions and for me was one of the best new features.<br><br>The education system has been simplified, which while it means you have more control over the specific traits your offspring develop, some (like me) may feel that it has been oversimplified and removes too much of the random chance (some of the best parts of the game are balancing \/ dealing with negative character traits) of characer development. Although random incidents occasionally pop up which effect character traits, I haven't come across one which wasn't simply 'pick the good trait or the bad trait' rather than having to agonise over the lesser of two evils (or better of two goods). On the plus side, from a role playing perspective, it does give you more of a back story explaining why characters have certain traits.<br><br>Overall I have no problems recommending this expansion, even at full price, let alone on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30675159', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30675159' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30675159\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30675159' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30675159\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30675159', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30675159_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30675159_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>9 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30389495\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055863344\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"95597616\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/6069b72494ea4e17c36dc0f50fce2118d26b20d2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/6069b72494ea4e17c36dc0f50fce2118d26b20d2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/60\/6069b72494ea4e17c36dc0f50fce2118d26b20d2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055863344\/\" data-miniprofile=\"95597616\">LionZ<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055863344\/games\/?tab=all\">42 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055863344\/recommended\/\">20 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198055863344\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI avoided it because off all the bad reviews, but it is an awesome DLC. Adds real historical flavor. Money and power are above religion or background in the society, so people hate you more because of those than for any other reason. Look at various historical sources and you'll see. <br>In the early game my two vasals were SO angry to the point of declaring an uprising against me. I mutilated all of their soldiers and commanders we captured and sent them back as a message of what's to come. After a year of war and war crimes, I won and locked both of them up. Then, mutilated them repeatedly. eye, hand, manhood, and they're never coming out of that dungeon alive. <br>Once you're in my dungeon, you stay there. End of the road for you.

I'm going to go over some pros and cons, explaining my personal opinion along with them.<br><br>PROS:<br><br>+ Vassals are now more difficult<br><br>When it came down to it, ruling an empire used to be far too easy. Send some gifts, or park your diplomat to improve relations with dissidents. Now, they actually come with a larger set of demands that tie in to the new Council system, which I will get in to later in the review. They're harder to please, and I've noticed my general relation floats from about -20 to +20, with notable exceptions like those I've granted titles to, etc. Forging relationships with more powerful vassals is important. Your internal politics -- as top liege -- will now mean a lot more than they used to. Some might call this a needless hindrance, or forced difficulty. I personally enjoy it.<br><br>+ The new council is more refined.<br><br>Before, your councillors were just tools. Assign the person with the highest corroborating stat, and there you go. Now, it's not so easy. Councillors want a say in how the realm goes. Even when you have absolute decision-making power, they will fight tooth-and-nail, creating factions to lessen your powers in more ways than just a 'Crown Authority' metric. Your stronger vassals will demand a space on your limited dais. It will be a great offense to them when you staff Johnny Lowborn because of his 23 stewardship. If you've mis-managed your vassals, or simply have too many, you're going to have to make some cuts or hastily delegate. They have their desires for the realm, such as seeking glory or just being pragmatic, which will sway their votes if they have power.<br><br>+ The laws (and the law screens)<br><br>The laws are no longer a huge list. There are a few pages with different types of laws. No longer will your tax\/levy obligations clutter up that page. Social and Centralization-related laws are together, and there are some that are new -- like women's rights.<br><br>NEUTRAL<br><br>~ The New Education System.<br><br>From ages 0 to 6, you can select one of many focuses for your child. These will then generate traits that will ready them for a more narrow education (your standard martial, stewardship, etc.) While this is immersive, and there are several nice  events that add some life to what is otherwise a bland portion of the gameplay, there's a lot of micromanaging, and you will be getting alerts for any child in your court. I got tired of clicking the 'Child needs an education!' only to see a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 from my twice-removed cousin.<br><br>I also find that children get a lot less traits, regardless of guardian. Childhood traits (Which are generic personality archetypes like playful, affectionate, brooding...) might manifest in to something, or not. There are also events that make no sense. I got one saying my child was turning out content. My non-accepting option was &quot;She should be more charitable!&quot;, while you think it would be to instill some ambition.<br><br>CON<br><br>----- Aggressive Expansion!<br><br>This is more fitting for Europa Universalis, and even there it's a detested mechanic. It's a decent idea. People unifying to protect themselves against the Karling menace. In my game, however, Karl's conquest of Saxony lead to a coalition consisting of: Asturias, the Umayyads, all of Ireland, Pictland, and England, Sweden, Norway, the sultanate of Africa, the CALIPH, Lombardy... You get my point? It's not people in the sphere, just 'people', and that's a problem. If they take over Saxony, perhaps the countries surrounding Saxony, or people of the same religion should give a damn? But all that wound up happening was a neutering of the challenge that Francia provides. He was soon crippled by revolts, and couldn't face any exterior opponent without bringing the whole world down on him.<br><br>- AI has a bigger proclivity for starting factions than it already did.<br><br>Due to the council mechanic, one of the biggest grievances is that the councillors would like more power, as I described earlier. The problem: This isn't limited TO councillors &amp; their vassals. Anybody in your realm can start, or support this faction regardless of how involved they'd be. While it doesn't splinter the nation on its own, the costly war of a liege vs 500% power will then bring the rest of the factions, which will destroy the Byzantines, Francia... Anybody.<br><br>All in all, there are good concepts, and there are very, very bad ones. But it's a solid enough DLC that changes some of the game's easier and more redundant mechanics for the better.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20922864', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20922864' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20922864\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20922864' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20922864\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20922864', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20922864_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20922864_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t158 of 221 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>11 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20913674\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"78276785\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/\" data-miniprofile=\"78276785\">The King in Yellow<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/games\/?tab=all\">274 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/\">39 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDelivering as promised, the new Council mechanics make the game much more interesting and indepth.

After a few playthroughs, I actually enjoy it and couldn't see myself playing without it anymore.<br><br>Don't get me wrong: I can see where the negativity is coming from. The council idea does restrict your rule, especially if you let it become more and more powerful, with a say in many of the decisions we were used to be able to make without consequences. I felt however that it added some major strategic layers into the game, and these added more weight to how we treat our vassals, especially the more powerful ones, and a higher degree of difficulty which I welcomed after a while.<br><br>After some practice, I found that keeping the council happy and limiting its power, through favors and diplomacy, is definitely achievable. In fact, I really like the favors system as a whole, as they add yet another dimension to relationships in the game, and can be used in a variety of useful ways - or against you to create some interestingly unpredictable situations.<br><br>I also appreciated the added depth in who to add to your council instead of simply choosing the courtier with the highest pertinent stat. It definitely feels more realistic to have to balance &quot;political&quot; appointees against those more skilled to the tasks they perform.<br><br>If your idea of fun is to play as a despotic ruler in a huge empire where your every word is law, then perhaps this DLC isn't for you (and there's nothing wrong with that, I might add). But if you seek more depth into vassal relationships, the need to balance your interests and goals with those of the people under you, and an added layer of depth to an already very deep and engrossing game, then you might want to give Conclave a try.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24296472', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24296472' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24296472\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24296472' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24296472\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24296472', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24296472_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24296472_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26690816\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979438474\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"19172746\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32f5752cc5599bc7214c8b14cce5ccf45653f689.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32f5752cc5599bc7214c8b14cce5ccf45653f689.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32f5752cc5599bc7214c8b14cce5ccf45653f689_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979438474\/\" data-miniprofile=\"19172746\">Zednaught<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979438474\/games\/?tab=all\">287 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979438474\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979438474\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tConclave has, lets put it charitably, a mixed record in the minds of fans, and for that reason I held off buying it. But, after giving it a shot, it's actually become one of my favorite pieces of DLC. To enjoy it, one must get in the mindset of a medieval ruler who, though a soverign, is not a dictator and does not enjoy absolute power. <br><br>What I enjoy most about it is that managing one's kingdom becomes more important, but-and this is important- not necessarily harder. Powerful vassals now demand seats on your council (chancellor, steward, etc) and will grow angry at you if they are not given a seat. This feels appropriate in a realm where every vassal seeks more power and influence. Their interests can no longer be overlooked as much as the past, and suddenly I find myself invested with learning about my vassals, whereas before I rarely cared. Skillful managing of these vassals feels more rewarding than without the DLC. <br><br>A new system of favors adds a new dimension of wheeling and dealing to the game. I've found this gives new opportunities for things like factions.<br><br>Passing laws requires the support of your council as well. I like the extra challenge as you trade favors for votes or try to stack the council with loyalists, but some may be turned off by how it makes passing laws more dificult. I feel it adds a more dynamic and natural progression to laws in the game.<br><br>Not everyone will enjoy this DLC, but for me it's indispensable. It doesn't add more difficulty just for the sake of wasting time. Conclave makes your vassals' interests more, well, interesting. Skillful use of the system allows for huge gains and control of your kingdom and the process of governing becomes more rewarding.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26690816', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26690816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26690816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26690816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26690816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26690816', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26690816_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26690816_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25275016\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/andarielhalo\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"78899640\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ca\/ca0485f6d0d57579458058d5cab45964f262fd42.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ca\/ca0485f6d0d57579458058d5cab45964f262fd42.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ca\/ca0485f6d0d57579458058d5cab45964f262fd42_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/andarielhalo\/\" data-miniprofile=\"78899640\">Andariel Halo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/andarielhalo\/games\/?tab=all\">250 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/andarielhalo\/recommended\/\">67 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/andarielhalo\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 31, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEDIT: my views changed slightly with play.  I put them at the bottom so I can keep track of my own thoughts<br><br><br>first n foremost this DLC is a major overhaul of some of the law systems in the game.  The changes are neither bad nor good, but depending on a great deal of things can be seen as an improvement.<br><br><br>first; crown authority.  this was the thing that sometgimes made the game a blithering \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to deal with.  vassals always want limited crown authority, in which the vassals can do whatever they want with impunity.  even going up to Low crown authority, which gives no real advantage to you beyond a slightly bigger levy, made them lose their \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and threaten insurrection every chance they got.  The ideal was always Medium crown authority, because that way vassals wouldn't fight each other but could fight foreign nations without you having to commit to war fully.  Any higher and the risk of constant insurrection would completely break your kingdom unless you're as huge as the Byzantine or Holy Roman Empire<br><br><br>this has been removed and elements of it spread around.  vassals will always fight unless you Enforce Realm Peace, which only lasts 5 years but can be renewed all the time and is largely favored by the council no matter what.  Other law-related things that previously fell under Crown Authority are separated with new legal decrees and with council authority, such as the council having authority to declare wars, revoke titles, execute, imprison, banish, etcetera without the king.<br><br>the best new legal option is the Status of Women, which allows for all kingdoms, even the muslim ones which inexplicably were solely agnatic, to eventually allow for female inheritance and rulers without having to play child-rearing games with the only 4 Basque characters on the entire map.<br><br><br>the huge deluge of negative reviews for this DLC kept me away from it for a long time, before I finally got into it.  As it turns out, the Council mechanic doesn't make the game any harder because it essentialyl replaces the aforementioned vassalhole-faction insurrection with just the councillors.  If you have the Council, you will almost never face faction threats (except for independence) and instead have to deal with the same 6-7 people rather than 35 blithering \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 v\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s.  Similarly, acquiesing to council requests puts you in a position of still having leeway to work with them via favors and requesting council support, as opposed to having your inheritence changed to Elective Monarchy and then losing the game when everyone votes for some other v\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.<br><br><br><br>The option is also there to abolish a council and have to deal with the Faction-nonstoprebellion system of old.  Doesn't matter to me, because there's enough new interactions to offset most of the relationship penalties for vassals not being on the council, and the only faction they can form is Independence so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 them anyway.<br><br><br>The education system is actually better than some of the reviews make it out to be.  The main thing I dislike is that it defaults on you educating and raising the children yourself rather than giving you the default option of having someone else raise them.  You pick from a tree of focuses which have the chance of giving certain base stats (such as Rowdy, Playful, Timid, Curious, etc) that affect their future education and likelihood of turning out good at certain stats over others.  There's just as many random event interactions that can change a course of their education or lead to gaining traits like Charitable, Brave, Craven, Zealous, etc, as there were prior to this education system.  The only major change is it's been systematized now to allow for greater direct control.<br><br><br><br>The alliance and non-aggression pact system is almost completely useless.  I'm constantly getting non-aggression pact offers and they rarely lead to anything other than making it hard for me to go to war with them 30 years later when they've inherited half my lands out of inter-marriage cheatery.<br><br><br>I'm not sure what the new military model thing is supposed to be, but the alleged greater emphasis on morale is a complete lie.  On more than one occasion I've had battles where my army slightly outnumbered an enemy army, only to be suddenly defeated for no reason other than randomness.  The Shattered Retreat mechanic makes little difference to me except when the army ends up travelling 2000 miles away from the front line into a completely different country.<br><br><br>Overall, this isn't worth the price.<br><br><br><br><br>EDIT UPDATE STUFF:<br><br><br>Playing more with this, i've found some of the things i wrote in this review aren't true<br><br>The new Council method doesn't make it any easier compared to the previous system of idiot vassals constantly rebelling, and lords can still form factions for stupid things and law changes.  The only thing they don't form factions for is Crown Authority which no longer exists.  As well, non-Council lords can still make Independence factions.<br><br><br>The main issue which has irritated me now is the Council's inconsistency which leads to situations which theoretically could\/would make sense in real life, but which could possibly be resolved better than the gameplay mechanics lmitations allow<br><br><br>Biggest and worst example; Councils permission to give titles<br><br>With this enabled, your council needs to approve you giving out land to vassals.  Most of the time they don't care, and especially like when you give out your own land so you're not so big.  But when you are over your Demesne limit, you get a relationship penalty with all your vassals as a result.<br><br><br>So you try to give away some land... only to find the Council is opposing you giving out any of your land, resulting in the Demesne limit penalty lasting even longer than it should.  You check the Councillors opinions, and it turns out 5 of them owe favors to one councillor who is a Malcontent (ie, will oppose you and everything you do for absolutely no reason, ie the obstruct obama method) or they just don't care and are swayed by the &quot;diplomacy&quot; rating of someone who doesn't want you to do it.<br><br><br>Most of the time you can resolve this by giving the land to one of the Councillors, especially if tyhey are a Glory Hound who wants it for themselves.  But more often than not, you'll end up with competing Councillors who want the land for themselves.  Reasonable-ness would have it so you as king\/queen would at least have the option of talking to these competers and either working out a compromise or explaining the situation so you don't end up with a Too Many Demesne penalty amongst ALL your vassals, but gameplay limitations don't allow this, so it's effectively either a broken gameplay mechanic or something to annoy you.<br><br><br>The best part of it is still the Full Status of Women thing.  It takes a lot of concentrated effort, as well as heavy investment in Tolerance, but once you get it it's so much better and pleasant to have a kingdom with Female rulers and heirs that don't cause stupid penalties, and having women generals and councillors so the general realm incompetence is at least not restricted to men alone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25275016', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25275016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25275016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25275016' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25275016\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25275016', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25275016_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25275016_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28197848\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/divm\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"132412051\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c3e4456fd4cedad235a94ea0664c210b44e797b6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c3e4456fd4cedad235a94ea0664c210b44e797b6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c3\/c3e4456fd4cedad235a94ea0664c210b44e797b6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/divm\/\" data-miniprofile=\"132412051\">david.divm<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/divm\/games\/?tab=all\">111 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/divm\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/divm\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs you will see, the reviews on this DLC were more negative than average: either &quot;it makes the game worse&quot;,or it is &quot;too difficult&quot;,&quot;it is broken&quot;. <br><br>I got to say some of them are justified, some are not. In brief: It is a DLC for experimented players, or those whose goals and playstyle are more realistic and want to add another layer of depth to the game.<br>Let's have a in-depth look:<br>-Conclave adds a twist to the governing and decision making part of the game: now, your Council matters in a political way, and not only as a way to boost your technology, taxes, plots, etc.<br>-The Council will have a set of rules to limit or expand its power, allowing them to vote on common laws (instead of passing them through each one of your vassals -this actually makes part of the game easier to manage-) and other aspects (declaring war, arresting people, etc.) that they might be allowed or not.<br>-Powerful or important vassal will obviously want a voice on the kingdom, so the internal politics of the game become much more dynamic.<br>-There are new events for the education of children, and it has been streamlined and simplify, having the Council to make the education almost automatically. This is the only change I'm not so convinced around, but it is not a big deal, and it is more realistic than the previos system.<br><br>For the complains of the DLC by other reviews:<br>-It was broken upon released, but that has been long fixed and with the latest versions of the game you can turn ON\/OFF many of the options that this DLC implemented, making your experience quite customized to your own taste. So ignore that part.<br>-Does it make the game more difficult or worse? Well, it is more difficult, sure, but not so much. And it makes the game so much better when managing big kingdoms or towards the end-run of your dinasty, when external politics and facts are as controlled as they can be and the game might get a bit dim.<br>I'm not a veteran player in Crusader Kings 2 (I got around 120h of game at the moment of this review), with three games through; and during my 2nd play through I had already noticed the lack of internal and active control\/opposition from vassals to your in-game behaviour. During my third game, I bought and installed The Conclave and I can tell it improved my experience and reached the difficulty level.<br><br>It is surely not for new players, so be aware. Also, if you start a game without and then install it and use it, you might run into conversion problems of your game, as the game wisely warns you when you do (I was using Byzantine and had to open the saved game file and fix several things that had changed in the conversion -administration laws, inheritance laws-).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28197848', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28197848' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28197848\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28197848' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28197848\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28197848', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28197848_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28197848_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t58 of 83 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23136842\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/athywren\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"37191966\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/07\/07466f4a276e128d317a6faa38fc4b9703c9ff9f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/07\/07466f4a276e128d317a6faa38fc4b9703c9ff9f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/07\/07466f4a276e128d317a6faa38fc4b9703c9ff9f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/athywren\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37191966\">Athywren<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/athywren\/games\/?tab=all\">796 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/athywren\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/athywren\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was originally wary of buying this DLC because of all the negative reviews, but it's actually really good. I'm not sure if it's been patched recently, but my experience is almost entirely different from that of the negative reviewers.<br><br>Conclave adds a new lawer of politicking to the game world, where your councillors (spymaster, marshal, steward, etc) actually form a council in your realm and attempt to exert control through it. Your most powerful handful of vassals will expect a seat on the council, which can be a problem if none of them have any skills above 10, but it is within the abilities of a canny ruler to determine who the most powerful vassals are, and you can always just deny them if you prefer the look of your lowborn candidate for spymaster. Denying their ambissions does give a fairly significant malus, but no worse than a title claimant who wants one of your counties. Factions will often spring up, asking for elective succession or more council power, but councillors cannot join these factions as long the council as a whole is kept content, and non-aggression pacts with other strong vassals, combined with keeping your own forces at arms strong, can guarantee that no faction gains enough power to force the issue.<br>In Conclave, power no longer rests solely with you, but in the barycentre between you and your councillors. That can lead to your becoming less potent than you might like, but keep your council's power small, and the centre of power will remain in your hands.<br><br>I almost didn't buy this because of the negative reviews, but I believe it's a truly great addition to the game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23136842', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23136842' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23136842\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23136842' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23136842\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23136842', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23136842_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23136842_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29596325\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Leivve\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"47592809\">Leivve<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMy major grip isn't with the systems and such themselves, everything is really good.<br><br>Giving the council more power makes them more then just numbers, and gives a layer of stategy on not only considering if the 22 deplomacy lowborn or the 2 deplomacy duke should be your chancilor, but also shuffling your council around to make sure you can get solid scores where you want them to be.<br><br>Favors though on the otherhand seem like they weren't fleshed out nearly enough. If you are not the top leige, they're great, and can give you great political power in the realm to help you become king. The moment you are king though, all they are used for is passing laws via calling in council support. They have a huge list of stuff you can spend favors on, but not only do you not get favors with the kinds of characters you would want to use the majority of that stuff on, but the overwhelming majority of them are not worth doing anyways. Only two really matter in game: &quot;Join Factions&quot; when you're a lower lord, and &quot;Call in Council Support&quot; when you are on top.<br><br>So what could have been a great mechanic that added great tactical depth, to the political strategy of the game, instead flops on its face right at the gate. Despite that though, it still adds something (even if it could have gone much further) to the game I do enjoy, and make the inter political balance between Lords and Kings more meaningful beyond them just &quot;holding&quot; the land for you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29596325', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29596325' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29596325\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29596325' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29596325\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29596325', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29596325_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29596325_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29310659\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020355303\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"60089575\">EagleShark (R)evolution<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDespite what many others say about this DLC, I like it.

One malcontent \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 will seemingly go out of their way to make sure that you dont get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 done, even going as far as to gain favors from the rest of the council.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29310659', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29310659' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29310659\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29310659' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29310659\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29310659', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29310659_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29310659_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28922446\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197976224027\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"15958299\">AlphaDave<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi guys,<br><br>well I really cannot understand the amount of bad reviews regarding &quot;Conclave&quot;. <br><br>By my opinion this DLC adds the right amount of &quot;salt&quot; to make this already great game even more immersive!

Well, apparently it's not a dlc for weak pu*sies.<br><br>Edit after 11 people downvoted this review:<br>Okay, so I started playing as the Seljuk Turks and I've already went through 300 years of campaign. I managed to conquer the whole de iure Persian Empire and half of the Rajastan, and here are my thoughts on this DLC in a few points: <br>1. Conclave makes the game more difficult - that is, vassals that are powerful get crazy (-40 to their opinion of you) if they don't get a seat in your council. That is why you have to plan and give the seats advisedly.<br>2. Conclave introduces that system of education, which is nice in a way. It makes the upbringing of a child a complicated process. You can decide whether you want to educate your child in etiquette, war, intrigue, or making money. There are two levels of education. First, you decide the initial stage (there're 8) - during that stage your child gets traits such as Fussy, Brooding, Rowdy. Then, there's the second stage - you choose the right\/actual education. The traits that your child has acquired during the first stage now will influence his\/her future. Before Conclave, traits such as Mastermind Theologian or Midas Touched were given randomly. Now, you can grow your own Mastermind Theologian or Midas Touched heir. <br>3. On the other hand, this system becomes a pain in the \u2665\u2665\u2665 if you play as a Muslim ruler (e.g. me now) and you have, like, 12 children and 10 young relatives you take care of. The game spams with notifications and I constantly have to choose their educational careers which sometimes is really annoying.<br>4. Besides that, this DLC adds Favors and changes a little the laws and Council mechanics. Basically, it's a good DLC. I didn't want to buy it for a long time because I read all the reviews of people who bi*ch about how hard the game has become. That's bullsh*t, okay? If you know how to play, if you know the mechanics, then you'll know how to restrain your vassals. And that's it. I play as the Seljuk Turks and I've been having everything under control since the beginning. Well, except for that one time when...<br>5. Yeah, your vassals, from time to time, will make a faction &quot;Increase Council Power&quot; or something like that. They'll join it eagerly, no matter if they like you as hell or not. If so, you'll have to do everything you can to discourage some of them from joining in. You can use Favor, you can bribe them, kill them, whatever. If they succeed, don't worry. They've just gotten more powerful and you'll have to always ask for their permission from now on. But relax, you can still undo this. Just make some of your councilors owe you a favor and pass the law abolishing councilors having power over you.<br>6. To sum up, the devil is not so black as he is painted, okay? This DLC adds some new features and in my honest opinion it does not deserve all the negative reviews, especially those like &quot;this game is unplayable now, vassals beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of me everytime&quot;. For me, the gameplay is just richer and more damanding, and that's it. Hope I didn't write all this in vein. All hail King Crimson.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27867731', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27867731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short27867731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27867731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short27867731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27867731', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27867731_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27867731_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short27299720\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CanYouSeeWhatISee\/recommended\/394320\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"130457946\">Laissez Unfaire<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis DLC makes the game harder.
