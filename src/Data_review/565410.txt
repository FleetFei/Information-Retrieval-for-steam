This is a text-based game that is meant as an introduction to Vampire the RPG. Iit takes the innovative and immersive form of being conducted entirely in terms of texts on your character's cell phone. As it turns out, this is a super creepy format for a horror game, since it drops you straight away into a tense situation that you do not yet understand. The art is amazing and the music quite effective. The game &quot;gets&quot; the sensual, violent, and frightening nature of the setting. In fact, I didn't have any intention to return to the game since I stopped playing 20 years ago. But now I do.

Now, just add vampires from the World of Darkness and an innovative messenger format and you've got one of the best interactive fiction games in recent years. <br><br>The cell phone text message format of the vampire story is surprisingly immersive and it's incredible how well the authors were able to present a thrilling story with this limitaton. Playing this on PC was great, but I imagine playing on mobile would be a ton of fun. The surreal art and moody music help transport you into a parallel underworld filled with monsters and paranoia. <br><br>Regarding the reviewers focusing on the &quot;politics&quot; of the game, please keep in mind that those are the sort of people triggered by the very existance of someone different than themselves. This isn't a political game. It's about vampires fighting each other. <br><br>I definitely recommend this game, even just for the Vampire half.

There are forces in this universe that tries to keep the supernatural inncidents under wraps so that humanity will not know of it, either out of the supernaturals own protection or to keep the status quo of power in check. <br><br>As I said before this game is basically a light novel, everything is text oriented and you just read the story as you progress. You will come by certain dialogue\/action options that you have to choose in order to progress and finish the story - If you choose the wrong option your character will end up dead and you will have to restart at the last check point at your progress. There's no cutscenes, character creation or &quot;true&quot; role playing elements or interactive gameplay besides clicking on your dialouge\/action in this game. So don't expect another Bloodlines or Redemption sort of deal.<br><br>Pros<br>-Solid story in my opinion. Interesting edgy, gothic themed horror writting that's sure to please a number of hardcore WoD fans.<br>-Good amount of artwork, colorful, &amp; flows well with the eyes.<br>-Satisfactory soundtrack that stays true to the franchise.<br><br>Cons<br>-No real options that give you a say on how the story will progress; It's linear and the wrong option will simply get you killed. What's worse is that you will have no clue\/indication of which is the bad option and you'll have to restart from your checkpoint, at times having to repeat stuff that you have already read.<br>-I'm not sure if the price is justified for what you're getting, it's all just reading basically. I paid $9.99 for it, I think slashing it in half would make this a fair purchase.<br><br>Another thing\/Rant:<br>A lot of people have been complaining that this game is too politically motivated.. and that there is some sort of ulterior agenda that the creators are trying to push on the WoD franchise. While the Mage game did deal with the Syrian Refugee crisis and there was a small part in Vampire of a Transgender Vampire who targets Trump supporters for their blood - The people who have been griefing over it have been overexaggerating. These sort of &quot;political&quot; machinations have always been apart of this franchise, Vampire has always dealt with real world issues and has always had that edgy gothic narrative that was meant to be &quot;in your face.&quot; - To shock. In any case, these minor details in the story did not distract me from wanting to uncover what was going on with the story. Have we come to a point where we're so divisive and partisan on everything, that we have to shout &quot;Im triggered.

In the Vampire story the viewpoint character is an American man newly created as a vampire as he flees on a bus from a party gone wrong, told through texting his friend Izzy. You discuss the morality of your need for blood and learn that your unlives are tied to one another and you're both in grave danger. In the Mage story you follow a young Swedish woman who, while volunteering in a refugee centre, experiences an awakening of magical powers alongside the appearance of several new figures who each want to influence the way you choose to use her magic.<br><br>If you want to understand why the reviews are so mixed, firstly from a gamer's perspective I'll admit you should have certain expectations - they're fairly linear storytelling, particularly the Vampire portion. Like the old Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, you have to make certain choices to progress and many of the wrong choices lead to your character's death, and back to a checkpoint. These don't have any deeper game systems, they're stories with some little offshoots that loop back to the main storyline. I have played each only once so there may be more divergence from the story to uncover, it feels like there is, especially in the Mage portion. <br><br>Vampire is told through messages on a smartphone screen (see screenshots), the Mage is a straightforward second-person prose story. The artwork has two different, chaotic looks and different artists for each story and contributes to the differing tone. The music in each manages to be comfortingly familar in feeling to VtM: Bloodlines while not sharing any artists. I think the art and music are very effective, though I'd have liked to have seen more images, more often. I assume limits of time and budget meant we got a fairly stripped back look. That said, what we have deepens the chaotic, uneasy World of Darkness setting and works well. The paintings in the Vampire game are often hard to decipher, but being disorienting is not the worst choice they might have made. I don't know the settings intimately, having read very little of the sourcebooks and only having played Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, so this might well be a reinvention in some way. I recognised the Tremere clan at least, and the Vampire story shows a little of them as antagonists. We learn little about the other characters or their place in wider vampire society, so there's much left unexplored.<br><br>To address the story content that seems to be at the heart of many of the mixed reviews: these directly take on the concerns of Millennial politics, and are very much of the contemporary setting. The Mage story revolves around the lives of those affected by the Syria refugee crisis, and I can offer two possible positions for why this is inappropriate. There are those who would say that horror stories shouldn't be political and those who would say that *this* horror story shouldn't be political. I'm more sympathetic to the latter, as it feels a little cynical to use a genuine, defining crisis of our time to frame a story that's essentially Doctor Strange but with sex magic. I don't know how much Mage as a setting relies on mortal concerns and the real world. After all, unlike Vampire, it does concern the living. It's clear from the Mage story here that it'll need a light touch to do this well. To address the other hot button in there: having a vampire character say they target Trump supporters could be upsetting, but people not liking Trump's movement (or even Hillary's) is a part of the culture and here is not central to the story, I'd argue that a setting where your allies kill people to eat their blood shouldn't make anyone feel great about what they're doing.<br><br>Overall, this is an okay taste of what re-entering the World of Darkness could be like, If we take it as a prelude to what we'll be getting in future titles then I'm sure it'll develop into a more robust setting when taken to a conventional game. I'd like a story rich in conspiracy and power struggles, only hinted at here, in the way the best RPGs can have, and the way that VtM: Bloodlines supplied so ingeniously.  I found the presentation here absorbing and although the stories were pretty slight, they felt like a glimpse into something much deeper. With both endings being quite abrupt and particularly that of the Mage story leaving hanging threads concerning the other characters who had been vying to influence you, it's certainly not going to leave you entirely satisfied. For the price and the time it took I had an enjoyably uneasy few hours with them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30340431', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30340431' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30340431\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30340431' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30340431\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30340431', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30340431_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30340431_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30442093\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kipsick\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"76200197\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e090e403d95a2873e317a82baace83b0bf64612.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e090e403d95a2873e317a82baace83b0bf64612.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6e\/6e090e403d95a2873e317a82baace83b0bf64612_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kipsick\/\" data-miniprofile=\"76200197\">anchova.vivisecta<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kipsick\/games\/?tab=all\">24 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kipsick\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kipsick\/recommended\/565410\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOkay. So I've read a bunch of the negative reviews and a lot of it is kind of reaching. I played through the Vampire game only, as both Zak Smith and Sarah Horrocks are phenomenal artists and honestly I was looking forward to consuming media created by leftist punks, and in Sarah's case an ACTUAL TRANS WOMAN.<br><br>The writing was phenomenal. Exactly the kind of wording that spits poetry and makes me think of reading through old VTM books as a fifteen year old school girl. It conjured up amazing imagery and really does an amazing caricature of Los Angeles\/Hollywood. I was intensely pleased by the character interaction, and the sheer inhuman-ness of the vampires. Now, I've seen a lot of complaints on how political the discourse was but honestly? To assume that vampires wouldn't give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about the politics of kine? Like that wouldn't effect the lives of kindred? I thought it was great to have characters that actually gave a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about the state of things. Especially to have the trans porn actress actually have an opinion DELIGHTFULLY UNHEARD OF. Honestly it read a lot like how I would have written a game for my friends. Honest, uncomfortably sexual, violent and with little bits of vampiric insanity and poetry. And as a trans guy, it was nice to have my sisters get some recognition as the badasses they are. On that note, I would like to have seen more of Avery but it's possible that I accidentally wrote her off with my actions(I'll be playing again tho so we'll see)<br><br>Also kudos for never revealing the main character's gender.<br><br>As for the format and art? This is a type of game. If you have never played this kind of text game, it's different. You are following a script. It's not much of a choose your own adventure but you have to be prepared for that. I loved the art but I'm an art snob and didn't mind the abstraction?<br><br>While I have some very minor problems with it, I can't say I didn't enjoy it. If you don't like poetic language and have triggers with violence and sexuality this game is not for you.

So far I played the mage one which stays true to the roots of the game. Before continuing let me tell you that the content is definetly mature and not suitable for all audiences. It's to be expected if you're familiar with the World of Darkness setting.<br>The story revolves around refugees and so it could be considered differently depending on the political views of the reader (and it's receiveing a lot of bad reviews for that, so the choice of tackling such a topic is debatable).<br>Also the technocracy (the guys against immigration in this case) can easily be seen as the bad guys. It's not written anywhere that they are bad. But Mage: the Ascension has always been about the conflict of order (science) vs. chaos (magic). <br>And the players in general tend to be users of magic. So you know who the obvious bad guys tend to be. Still it's possible to choose and to define what happens on a wider scale than what you would expect. The narrative has A LOT of unsettling moments in accord to the clich\u00e9s of Mage: the Ascension (well, I tend to be more a fan of Mage: the Awakening, but I love both settings). Especially there are a lot of &quot;trippy&quot; scenes that I loved.<br>The story is well written and presented and it is good. It tends to railroad the player a bit but it makes sense as much of what happens is outside the protagonist experience and it's necessary to bring the story to some fixed points to make it work. However some blocks of text change according to your choices and you can avoid entirely some optional scenes. A big problem is that it seems to be nothing carried over between chapters which also means that the replayability seems quite limited. <br>I finished the story in about three hours, but I read very fast. No really, I do. <br>Also I still need to replay some scenes to see what happens with the other choices. A good thing is that the choices are not always easy ones.<br>I would say that the Mage story has about 8-10 hours of &quot;gameplay&quot; (a.k.a. reading) in it including replaying it to get different scenes and endings. Or to compare it to a book I would say that it has something like 60-90 pages (however it can get a lot lower if you avoid scenes or play it only once).<br>My score for the Mage story would be 7\/10, but I'm a big fan of Mage so I'm probably biased.<br>Most reviews so far say that the Vampire story is better. Overall I would suggest to give it a shot if you're a fan of the tabletop RPG or the videogame (but then remember that Mage is... Something completely different).<br><br>I just played the Vampire story too. Well... It was underwhelming. Not terrible but I would give it a 5\/10. The narrative has to pass through the cellphone in the form of chatrooms so a lot of the discussions are weird. Apparently there's a moment when the protagonist uses the phone while sawing an hole in a wall. In two occasions he uses voice-to-text while trying to be stealthy. That aside there's very little to make you understand what's happening and you have several chats texting you at the same time making it a bit obnoxious to switch between them all the time.<br>There are several situations in which you have to guess which solution does not make you die. If you guess wrong you have to backtrack a few minutes. And several choices are a bit random (spoiler: if you turn a corner apparently it's more dangerous than leaping down stairs).<br>The writing is minimalist and in many cases the action is not properly described.<br>However the story is longer than the Mage one, or to be precise feels longer because it has more choices.

Reasons you'll understand in the game.<br><br>10 Euros is quite a big sum for such a game (well, if you're a fan like me you probably already bought it so it's a moot point) but if you find it on sale I would advice you to buy it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30049331', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30049331' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30049331\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30049331' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30049331\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30049331', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30049331_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30049331_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29965459\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/grossvogel\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"60044463\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c44256b018b712e113b88a0fbebf842bf1c41dc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c44256b018b712e113b88a0fbebf842bf1c41dc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2c44256b018b712e113b88a0fbebf842bf1c41dc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/grossvogel\/\" data-miniprofile=\"60044463\">Grossvogel<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/grossvogel\/games\/?tab=all\">397 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/grossvogel\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/grossvogel\/recommended\/565410\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tZak Sabbath's intro to Vampire \u2014 chaotic, confusing, at times downright rambling and incoherent \u2014 is sheer brilliance.

I've played this game twice now and feel more qualified for a review.<br><br>Anyway, this game is a sort of &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot; text game with a few illustrations thrown in.<br>The Game is told entirely though the perspective of the protagonists smart phone messaging application. The Protagonist, Case, finds himself (or herself the player's gender is never revealed) turned into a vampire after a party. Nothing is explained to Case though, as his Creator disappears immediately after instructing him to leave the city. The game starts with the him on the run while slowly discovering the details of his new condition. Most of this is conveyed to the player via Case chatting with Izzy, his friend who was also turned vampire on the same party as Case.<br><br>I was very sceptical about this format at first, but it works surprisingly well. The messages are written like you would expect people chatting over their phones to write, imprecise, colloquially and often orthographically incorrect - generally like people in distress and a hurry to convey information with a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 digital smartphone keyboard would write.<br>This imprecision in the writing makes sense and helps with the horror atmosphere of the game, as you're never quite sure how exactly everything happened and uncertainty paints more terrible pictures in your mind than a comprehensive description would. Unfortunately sometimes it was too imprecise and I couldn't figure out what was being said.<br><br>The interactivity I rate as decent, it has one big branching path at the beginning and a few smaller options here and there as well as many bad ends. These bad ends are often hard to avoid, sometimes you're given small hints as to which option is the correct one and sometimes it depends on previous choices made, but a lot of the time It came down to trial and error for me. Overall you get to make more meaningful choices than in your average Telltale game - which isn't saying much but still.<br><br>The game's biggest strength though, is it's atmosphere. It is uncomfortably dark and the writing does a good job at conjuring nightmarish imagery. The Illustrations are, like the writing, atmospheric and vague. The games very personal and &quot;down &amp; dirty&quot; story is a very nice contrast to the 90's or almost 80's glam vampires involved in global conspiracies that you usually get with VtM.<br><br>Unfortunately the game falls off a bit in the second part of the story. The Writing weakens, though the dialogue with the big bad guy at the end is a last highlight.<br><br>Overall, while I enjoyed this game immensely, It is not a game for everyone. The game's format is clearly not going to be everyone's cup tea and in addition to that it is going to take many people out of their comfort zone with it's thematization of sexuality, violence and abuse. The creator of V:tM wrote in the core rules :&quot;This game wasn't meant to be comfortable.&quot; Well, WEBAAFAD certainly isn't.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30605554', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30605554' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30605554\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30605554' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30605554\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30605554', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30605554_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30605554_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30301280\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198020711875\/recommended\/565410\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"60446147\">falkenberg.martin<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 23.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have only tried the vampire part so far and I really like it.

I do not deny that. But the presentation feels so simple and brilliant, that even playing this on my notebook looking at the phone in the cente of the screen I feel immersed into the dark and twisted narrative unfolding in front of me.I feel invested into it. <br>If you are reading this, it most likely means you have played &quot;Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines&quot;, so I will end this short review like this: if you ever wanted to return to that sweet world of nightmares and blood, this is the game for you. <br><br>P.S. I am actually tempted to buy this game for my iphone as well, just for the sake of utter immetsion when I give it to someone else to play.<br><br>P.P.S.

As long as you aren't triggered by transgender vampires and refugees, that is.<br><br>I found the characters in the Vampire storyline to be annoying but that's probably because I'm too old to be hip with all of the degeneracy the kids are into these days. It wasn't a bad story; I just couldn't relate to it very well. Any mentions of politics seemed relevant and not forced in case you were wondering.<br><br>I enjoyed the Mage story more even though it seemed to be shorter. If the refugee crisis triggers you then just remember that you can BTFO hippies and refugees by siding with the Technocracy. It wasn't a very fulfilling ending but the option is there. Political references here are again relevant given the setting of the story. I really don't see why so many people seem to be bent out of shape over the politics in this game. I voted Trump and I am by no means a Tumblr snowflake.<br><br>So if you can enjoy a story for what it is without getting your panties in a twist over some identity politics then you may like this game. Ten dollars may be a bit high but there is replayability to the Mage story. The Vampire story seems to railroad you toward one conclusion. I'd wait for it to go on sale if you're not a WoD junkie.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30248278', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30248278' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30248278\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30248278' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30248278\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30248278', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30248278_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30248278_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30208702\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/batmannananananananananana\/recommended\/565410\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"112985299\">Errrm<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is a type of 'chose your own adventure' it includes two stories which you can play out (This is an all text based game, however you can unlock differnt art\/pictures thoughout playing, as well as listen to the music - which can change depending on the situation) <br><br>I played though the vampire one and it manged to keep my interest, I liked acting out the struggles of the character and selecting what the character would do in this situation. It gave a real sense of 'the world isn't as it seems' the setting as most would expect from a vampire game could be considered dark.  But thats the reason we grew to love VTM right? <br><br>Fans of the game VTMBL will notice some terms what are used such as <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> Thin Blood\/s <\/span><\/span> <br><br>Over all I think its a good time killer, it doesn't take long to complete the game nor is it overly complex with its choices, I think some of the wording could be improved though so you're 100% clear on your choices and what you're selecting. <br><br><br>Now talking to about the mage one, sadly I can't say much about this, It did not keep my interest in the slightest. It felt like a bad fan fiction. Admitingly I didn't get though that much of it, but what I did play though gave me reason enough to think of it like that. I may go back and try again at some point; maybe I have it wrong and the further you go the more darker themed it gets - which I could see as a high possiblity considering some of the things what was happening in the character country. <br><br>With the mage one, I'm willing to replay it at some point if I get the time, but I'm not currently sure if I will follow though with that. If I do and change my mind - or even if it still feels like a fan fiction I may update on this review to reflect that.<br><br>So do I recomend this:<br>For this I think it depends on the person, I can't say you'll enjoy this if... <br>Honestly for the price (\u00a36.99 at the time) it isn't that bad - and thats from only playing though the vampire one. Maybe read up on it a little more see if it sounds appealing to you. I'm going to say yes on steam as I liked plaything though the vampire side of it - there also isn't a meh option. If you want to find out more to see if it is for you I bealive they have an offical site, a trailer and there will undoubtly be youtube videos on the game.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30208702', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30208702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30208702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30208702' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30208702\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30208702', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30208702_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30208702_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/565410\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 94 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30659578","30341117","30516140","30340431","30442093","30053028","30049331","29965459","30049141","29963796"]}
