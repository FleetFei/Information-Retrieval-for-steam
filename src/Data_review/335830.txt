SO why bother giving it a try now? Well, with steam being a bastion of junk and scams, a seeming feeding ground for dubious developers taking advantage of PC gamers, from hit and runs, abandoned EA games, abandoned released games that aren't removed as they should be, and terrible mobile and app ports. Add that to Valve's horrible quality control and well, finding Devs who actually OWN their games (Mistakes and all) and contnue to support, expand, tweak, and  repair their game is not as common as it should be or even needs to be. The devs of this game appear as of now to be those kind. They've done a lot to balance and tweak the game since release and it shows in a more positive rating and experience. Certainly worth supporting if you like this genre of game. I've had no problem with it and it's been fun so far. Do not regret the purchase.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the first review I have ever posted for a game on steam. That being said I felt moved to do so because I think I have input that may prove helpful to the players and developers alike. I spent a great deal of time watching videos and reading reviews before I made my purchase discision and I must say that in the very short time that I have played and with the promising involvement of the develpers I am confident I won't be dissapointed with spending my money on this game.<br><br>Within the first few moments of battle I started to scratch and itch that I've had for a very long time. I have been craving a fast-paced space rts of a certain type for a long time. Distant Star: Revenant Fleet has a great feel and an excellent balance of fleet combat control and ship modability plus its a roguelike to boot. I would recommend anyone who enjoys the space genre as well as the roguelike genre to consider getting this game.<br><br>As for helpful information, I want to say that after watching several videos and reading many comments I feel that perhaps many players do not have a very solid grasp on the most effective way to play. I don't mean for that to sound arrogant. What I do mean is that the developers have made it difficult for new players to jump straight in. I haven't done the research to see if the features I'm about to suggest are in development but I do feel that if they were they would have been implemented with the transition from alpha to beta. The game offers a excellently executed tactical drop in and out of combat pause system. Understanding how to use this effectively is in my opinion the key to playing the game successfully. On some of the videos I watched the commentators talked about having to constanly be on the move and not being able to activate ship abilities or a sense of not having enough control over what is actually taking place in the battle in relation to the players ships. The reality is that all the control you need is right at your fingertips. The problem is that is never told or shown to you. If a player doesn't intuitively recognise that a certain level of control is necessary and doesn't search for the controls in the menu then their first couple of experiences in battle can sour their opinion of the game. What I'm suggesting is that the developers incorporate a tutorial like experience in the first mission. Instead of dropping you into a battle and just saying survive please add tips that say press spacebar for tactical mode. Then once the player does so add some more tips explaining the benifit of tactical mode and just what the player can do. Features like hotkeys for your ships and their abilites and basic commands like defend this target are an absolute must in this genre and the game has them. It just doesnt tell the player. Because of this I feel like the game is not as unbalanced per say as players believe. I was able to take the starting ship and just a lancer with no additional upgrades to the end of the first sector and through several combat nodes with relative ease simply by utilizing the tools that are there. <br><br>--Feature Suggestions--<br>1. Tutorials <br>2. I would love to be able to que multiple movements for my ships. In other words Holding shift and creating waypoints for my ships to travel along. <br>3. I'm not sure if this isn't already implemented in some fashion and I just haven't discovered it yet but I would like to see information about enemy ships. Nothing game breaking of course but just simple stuff for the sake of immersion.<br>4. I would like to be able to zoom out just a little bit further. you can't see the max range of the lancer's laser without panning your screen. This left me unaware that it could target a location instead of a specific ship which is tactically useful information.<br><br>Sorry for the excessively long post and thank you to anyone who took the time to read it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14701567', 'summary' );

I played on normal and didn't die until I reached the final boss level. (a bit too easy) It felt pretty consistent through each sector until the very last room, where it really spiked and I was killed before I could even reach the boss (a bit too difficult) but the devs seem to be very active so I hope they will have a second look at this.<br><br>But all in all, I really enjoyed it.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17262920', 'summary' );

of Early Access games, having now seen and made it through the initial wave of Early Access highs and lows, we're now seeing a more matured approach to the Early Access platform, with more specialised projects and more consistent and constrained planning resulting in products that actually deliver on their promises. DSRF was sold as a Rogue &quot;lite&quot; in space, where you'd assemble a small fleet of ships, guide them across the solar system, and then engage in a showdown in a final battle much like the genre definer FTL.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Distant Stars, and the not so Distant Stars...<\/div><br>Much like FTL, you work your way across multiple sectors, each sector contains multiple jumps, however, unlike FTL, there's only four sectors that you'll be working your way across as you head towards the final battle, meaning your average playthrough is much closer to two to four hours, as opposed to the four to eight in FTL. However, unlike FTL, instead of managing -one- ship with a few upgrades, here you'll be managing a full fleet, each with their own weapon systems (in some cases, multiple weapons systems), sub systems, and passive systems. <br><br>The blend of upgrades means that fleets can in theory be quite unique (in practice, there's usually one generally optimal approach for fixing the deficiencies for each ship, straying too far is a bad idea). The ships too will upgrade with experience, granting bonuses in various ways, again, helping you compensate for their weaknesses or exaggerating their strengths. These upgrades are not exactly anything amazingly unique, but there's a good enough variety per ship to keep things interesting.<br><br>Of special mention are the weapon systems, of which there is a serious number, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, allowing for a significant degree of tactical flexibility and nuance within your fleet, this is extremely useful, and can allow for a player to adapt on the fly, particularly if things go sideways and they lose a valuable ship during the course of the voyage.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Of tactics, tactical pause, orders, and mo(ba)ment to moment combat...<\/div><br>Once you jump into a sector, the game moves to a top down view of your ships, moving around a two dimensional &quot;pane&quot; of space, with the sun behind it, filtering light through to give a sort of 3D effect. It's rather effective, and pretty. Combat therefore works by ordering your fleet (up to five units) around the 2D map and having them reposition, attack, use specials, cover each other, heal each other, etc. Line of Sight can be used and abused to cover each other (units are solid objects, so weapons will hit the first thing they make contact with), and specials are often &quot;skillshots&quot;, which means that moving can disrupt or even cause them to miss.<br><br>This should sound very much like a singleplayer version of most MOBA type games, and that's because in a sense, it is. It carries a lot of the fundamentals of that type of game in the genesis when you're playing the tactical map mode, but you have the benefit of a pause mode that allows you to issue orders and activate specials whilst the pause is set, then allow time to proceed on its' merry way once more, pausing when you need to issue fresh orders. Disabled units will suffer critical damage at first, represented by debuffs that carry over from sector to sector, however, with each critical suffered, the chance for them to be entirely destroyed begins to tick up, if they take too many criticals, well, you may lose a ship altogether, and in this game, that can be a punishing blow, especially late game. Units in this game are extremely valuable, and losing one can be crippling, enough to trash a game and force a restart.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Ruthless voyagers in skies deep blue...<\/div><br>The A'kari are not a pleasant or amiable lot. Their culture is very warrior caste, and it's very clear as you travel through space that you are just &quot;a side&quot; in the war, if anything it's quite possible that you're the bad guys. This moral ambiguity is both interesting and potentially a downside, the problem with such a situation is that for some players, it's important to have the belief that they're on the &quot;good&quot; side when playing these kinds of games. The A'kari often resort to less than wholesome tactics to make their way through the game (as the necessity of their mission requires), but that will come with a moral weight to it, and if you become invested or put some time into thinking about the lore or backstory of the game, well, it may leave you wondering if you're actually playing for the right side.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Reflections in glowing suns and off glinting guns...<\/div><br>The graphics aren't -quite- Homeworld Remastered, but nonetheless, they're definitely good enough to pass muster, presenting clearly defined racial ships for both the A'kari and the Orthani, along with a third set of ships for the neutral Pirates. The backdrop itself is colourful and clear, with a good set of nebulae and lighting presentation being well handled and running smoothly throughout. This is a well designed and imagined game. Of specific mention is the soundtrack, which is really, <i>really<\/i> good. We're talking standout quality, easily worthy of being a standalone OST if ever they decide to release it as such.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">... and the fire and fury of the missiles...<\/div><br>When combat takes place, the playfield is colourful and bright, the music sweeps up to an orchestral swell, the explosions are many, debris litters the place as ships disintegrate in style. This game makes space combat look -good-, and does a good job of hiding the MOBA style combat under it's interface and behind the active-pause button, but with the limited number of sectors, and the fact that the game doesn't support the same level of replayability as FTL, this is a game to play in shorter bursts, as a side dish to things like FTL.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Closing thoughts...<\/div><br>DSRF does a lot right, and in some areas it does break some interesting new ground, however, it doesn't -quite- do enough to break free of FTL's shadow, and it doesn't quite do enough to stand far enough away to net it my unguarded praise. Which is a shame, because there's a lot to like about this game, for people who are big on Sci-Fi and Roguelites, this may prove to be too tempting to miss, for people who are looking to get &quot;into&quot; such games, FTL is still the daddy.<br><br>Verdict : <b>Wishlist it, if you're a fan of Sci-Fi, and particularly FTL, give this one some serious consideration.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15908049', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15908049' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15908049\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15908049' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15908049\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15908049', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15908049_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15908049_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/recommended\/335830\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14133249\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"42468400\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02f76e44c7915404263a3a4bf355e88abb60df3c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02f76e44c7915404263a3a4bf355e88abb60df3c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/02\/02f76e44c7915404263a3a4bf355e88abb60df3c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42468400\">Dad's Gaming Addiction<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/games\/?tab=all\">1,513 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/recommended\/\">337 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dadsgamingaddiction\/recommended\/335830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Distant Star: Revenant Fleet was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst Impressions:<br><br>Distant Star: Revenant Fleet reminds me of FTL but with RTS elements.  To sum this up, you'll jump from point to point and encounter various events (pirates, enemy fleets, dialogue choices, etc.).  When docked at a friendly station, you can purchase new ships and\/or upgrades for your existing ones.  Unlike FTL, the action sequences are less crew specific and more about controlling 1-5 ships inside an arena-esque map and activating their individual abilities timely.  Some things do rub me the wrong way: no difficulty setting, encounters\/enemy waves tend to be too long, and the battles tend to be stacked against you to the point where you're dancing and running constantly.  I never felt like I was powerful enough to stand toe to toe with enemies in these events.  The right click sound (when moving) is incredibly annoying as well.  Still, $7 is a pretty good value for what the game has to offer thus far...though I'd personally play this more if the game had an easier difficulty setting or at least scaled in difficulty appropriately.  I suppose we'll see if this gets addressed throughout the course of development.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4CqwrMH54p0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4CqwrMH54p0<\/a><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8y5Ak_9fT-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8y5Ak_9fT-4<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14133249', 'summary' );

Backgrounds are very artistic and i love how energy shields look.<br>+Pretty easy to learn, but hard to master. I had to start a new game after a few levels.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Shops are randomly generated, and cannot be returned to. This can make it hard to get the ships that you want.<br>-Although it is RTS, later in game you really have to keep pausing the game to order ships around if you want to survive.<br>-The same choices always seem to have the same out-comes.<br><br>Now, personally I like a challenge, so the death and supply systems make the game better for me. However they will annoy some people:<br>-When a ship dies it gets a negative buff through levels. The more negative buffs it gets, the more likely it is to be permanently destroyed. (negative buffs include slow hull drains, reduced damage etc).<br>-To move to another level costs supplies. Traveling without them causes your ships top gain negative buffs (as stated above).<br>Overall, i can see myself playing this a lot. 8\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16084667', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16084667' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16084667\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16084667' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16084667\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16084667', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16084667_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16084667_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13311301\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shoggofu\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71896252\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/634e6ac81aacd666009d44c8f79b686033d27bab.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/634e6ac81aacd666009d44c8f79b686033d27bab.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/634e6ac81aacd666009d44c8f79b686033d27bab_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shoggofu\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71896252\">shoggofu<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shoggofu\/games\/?tab=all\">266 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shoggofu\/recommended\/\">93 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shoggofu\/recommended\/335830\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Distant Star: Revenant Fleet was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 10, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like the game. But you need to realize that it is pre-alpha, at only version 0.0.0.3. It's very short at the moment, very short. And at least in my case some features appeared not to function as they should. But I'm sure future versions will address these issues as well as flesh out the gameplay.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/9gdTMJ8F4NY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/9gdTMJ8F4NY<\/a><br>The graphic are simple, I like these kind of 2 dimensional top down space games and I like the style.<br>-----The music is spacey and pleasant. It reminded of magic carpet of all games with it's (middle eastern?) string instrument sound.<br>-----There is some dialogue at each encounter, against the back drop that you are from a dominant space faring faction which is served by other factions and at war with another major faction the Orthani. I liked it.<br>-----It would be nice if units didn't talk every single time you give them a command, that is not every split second lol<br><br>I haven't played FTL, but I've watched people play it. It basically seems to work on a similar concept. That is between encounters you select your next Star System destination within a randomly generated network of Star Systems. Encounters can be hostile or neutral. You can choose to attack, intimidate or avoid conflict at most encounters.<br>-----You also come across shops where can attain additional ships and equipment to fit to them including weapons and active abilities. <br>-----There is no fleet control tutorial yet. In combat, ships in your fleet by default fire upon the closest hostile vessel. You seem to be able to prioritize specific targets if you wish. You also tell ships where to move during an encounter. Basically it plays exactly like at RTS.<br>-----Most ships other than the Assault class type are very fragile. Usually these weaker ships in my fleet tended to be destroyed almost immediately because I couldn't move them out of harms way quickly enough. Any of your ships that aren't moving or are doing so in a straight line are basically sitting ducks and will destroyed very quickly.<br>-----So ultimately my strategy ended up boiling down to flying only assault class ships and kiting the enemies I encountered. This was a very effective strategy. But it wasn't a satisfying experience. Your ships will not move by themselves, without your intervention they will just sit there. You have to constantly micromanage their movements, which potentially is demanding with a progressively larger fleet at your control. Encounters typically consisted of flying circles around a wave of enemy ships until they were destroyed and repeat several times until the encounter is over, there wasn't really any challenge. I wasn't really fond of constantly directing ships, which you must do because of the games pace.<br>-----You can basically finish the game in just a few minutes. You can just travel directly to the 'exit' system while avoiding every hostile encounter along the way. And Bob's your auntie, you win!<br>-----In the games current state, if want an extended space adventure you need to avoid traveling directly to your final destination. That is visit all the star systems which aren't on the way there.<br>-----I had a few technical problems with the game. I couldn't scroll the view to the right with the mouse cursor because the cursor would travel outside of the game on my first screen and into my second screen, I had to awkwardly reach around my microphone with my left hand to scroll with the arrow keys. Shops didn't appear to function properly and I had to fiddle around a lot with the menu to purchase items successfully. You are supposed to be able to pause the action by pressing space however this was completely non-functional for me. Lastly <br>-----So I think the game-play needs to be fleshed out to make it more satisfying interesting and challenging, I think most people might agree with that. But personally I would prefer if units autonomy wasn't restricted to firing at the closest hostile ship. Or alternatively if more advanced commands were implemented to reduce the need for micromanagement being so constant. Lastly with pretty much any single-player game I would like there to be some way of enjoying the game online with friend or other people aka multi-player.<br><br>I think this a good foundation for a great game.

Objectively speaking, that's true, but it's not as 'roguelike' as people looking for that specific genre might be looking for. As a rogue fanatic myself, I'll be honest with you; It's a roguelike in the sense that it has random world generation and random encounters down pat, along with permadeath and proper consequences for actions that are more often than not your own fault. That said, there isn't as much depth to the management of your fleet as you'd expect, and so I can't really consider this a full-fledged rogue experience. It's more half-and-half than anything, and while some people have complained that it's not really sure what it wants to be, I think the devs know exactly what they're aiming for, and that it just needs some tuning to get there.<br><br>The only real connection it bears to FTL is in navigation between sectors and the fact that it's set in space. The gameplay is entirely different beyond that. So rather than compare it to another game and judge it based on how it measures up, I'm going based on its own merits, and that leaves me with a rather positive first impression. With a bit of polish to work out the kinks, I can easily see this becoming just as popular.<br><br>As it stands, the game is fun. Possibly not worth the heft 19 dollars being charged for an indie game from a company you've likely never heard of, but still a fun title that won't leave you disappointed.

After around 16 hours of play I wanted to add a &quot;review&quot; just to say it's fun and challenging and personally I find it's a great little game. The only thing lacking is that there are no mods, which would really expand the replayability. It's a fairly straightforward game mechanic but has enough variety and play-styles to keep me replaying. I find the sci-fi elements are pretty well written too, which is rare for this kind of low-budget release. I'm not sure why people are negatively reviewing it, personally I think it's a great example of the kind of game it is. Plus it's entirely playable by mouse, which means it's nice and casual even though it's pretty hard. There are some very minor bugs (such as certain thruster-jets showing behind the fog-of-war) but so far I didn't see anything but a polished product.

Not that hard to get into. May take you a few hours to run through, depending on your playstyle.<br><br>I rather enjoy the overall atmosphere of Distant Star: Revenant Fleet. The story is interesting and the events that unfold are really cool to read (even if a few may repeat themselves during a run). The soundscape is great. The music very much reminds me of Homeworld while being its own. And I just love the sounds the ships make when you give them orders.<br><br>There are elements of this game that are reminicent of FTL. The way you jump from point to point, sector to sector, culminating in a final boss-like battle. How each point may have a random (or non-random) event. Each sector has an overaching theme (hostile\/friendly\/neutral in this case). All of this I really like, in both games.<br><br>Combat is enjoyable. Seems overly simplistic at first. Then you get into later battles and realize positioning and timing your skill activations become very important to survival.<br><br>My biggest knock against this game: not enough event variation. While there are a decent number, this title could use more. And there are some events that feel like they should happen only once, but I had occur multiple times (usually in different sectors).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29513317', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29513317' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29513317\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29513317' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29513317\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29513317', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29513317_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29513317_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29304249\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DeaconW\/recommended\/335830\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"7033876\">deaconw<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 7.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a fun, tactical rogue space fleet combat game with light RPG elements.  For $10 it was well worth the 8 hours of enjoyment I got out of it.  I like that it is procedural, every &quot;map&quot; isn't the same.  You also get to make choices how you progress through a region.  The save game feature is limited, but really isn't a deal breaker (and I am normally a save-freak).  The most important advice:  always buy supplies!  This will make everything else easier.  I ended up bulding to a 3 Dreadnaught, one Carrier, One Assault fleet that worked really well.  While movement tactics are simple, you do need to keep moving to minimize damage.  I agree with others that all of it's elements are simpler than implementations in other games but for what it is...a simple, easy to just drop in and play a mission, game, it does all of the elements fine.  The only weakness I would say is the RPG element.  I only saw a couple of instances where my decision made a clear difference.  Most things ended in battle for me anyway.  it still adds a nice additional layer between the battle progression.  There is also obvious repetition in the types of missions (escort, protect bases, capture bases, just fight, etc).

It reminds me somewhat of Battlestar Galactica or the classic game Homeworld. Originally, I had difficulty with saving the game. I couldn't figure out a way to do this as it wasn't straight forward. The developer as well as some in the community were very helpful in finding a way around this. I hope an opt out of permadeath will be added to the game in the future. I'm not a big fan of permadeath simply because I often play games to relax. I hate spending a lot of time playing through a game only to die mid way through and have to start over from the beginning.

Background story is told through mission briefings and such, with additional quests that you can follow but are not mandatory. Missions are pretty believable, as are the dialogs and the choices you need to make  - as in, if you're short with fuel, will you raid a neutral station. Travelling through sectors itself can become interesting - if you have sustained damage, do you travel toward a potential repair facility that can be an ambush or you leave the sector asap, risking an encounter with a stronger enemy...<br><br>Now, none of this is really new and nothing here is so mind-blowingly good that you'll write home about it.

And they did so through AMAZING and dedicated support, that every developer out there should take a page from to be frank. I want this at the top of my review because it's the most critical aspect to me--whether you like a game or not is subjective (aside from mechanical or design flaws), but whether the developers are worth their salt is not. These guys have done well to earn their place in the gaming industry, I think.<br><br>About the game itself and my thoughts. I grew up a multigamer, but my core has always been RTS. On that note, the closest gameplay I can associate it to would be something like Ground Control, stuffed into a roguelike progression system with scenario-based play\/missions. Frankly, I loved the old Ground Control series as I tended towards a micro-focused RTS player for most of my time. And roguelikes are my favorite genre to play inbetween my mainstay titles.<br><br>Sure, this game has had issues upon release and things you can nitpick for a long time afterward. You can read other reviews to get pages upon pages about all of that. I soared through this game like 2-3 weeks after release and got my first win, after only 1-2 attempts on Elite difficulty. There were definitely challenges here and there. I tried to keep pausing to a minimum. But that was expected (imo) from someone with my background. However, the game was still FUN, and the game is even more enjoyable now. Seems more challenging now as well--and that's coming from someone who's played nearly every RTS since Warcraft 2 dropped. It's certainly worth sinking several runs into now, as you should in any roguelike. But bear in mind, I can only speak for Elite difficulty as it's all I've played.<br><br>I saw that the devs were initiating a massive campaign of overhauling the game back then, so I let it sit until now. Coming back to it, I can say it's now polished enough to be taken seriously by everyone. Give this title a purchase if you have any interest in squad size RTS at all. The pause feature makes it accessible for literally everyone. I feel like cramming RTS into a roguelike and making it a truly playable title was quite a feat, to be honest. I prefer this over the horde of twin stick shooter roguelikes that have been surfacing the past few years.<br><br>I'm hoping Blazing Griffin get enough support and have the desire to add more content to this title. I would love to see this type of game with the depth of replayability that most of the more well known roguelike titles have. How they should go about that, I'm not sure. But I feel like the potential is there. \/end rant\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25873420', 'recent_short' );
