My choices affected not only my story but more poignantly my appearance and how I built my character.  The combat works well enough and like your story has multiple paths you can follow.   I chose quick dagger attacks with riposte and fire, lots and lots of fire.   I even had groupies that aided me in battle and added to the story.  My favorite was the White Witch and her ability to curse my foes with detrimental effects.  Even though most of the time I used her as bait to hold the undead\u2019s attention with her skimpy dress so I could more easily stab them in the back with a fire dagger she never once complained, bit of a masochist I think.  Oh and the crafting, it really affects the game, is easy to use and adds a nice level of management on top of the character building.  I built traps and potions, enhanced my equipment and weapons and recycled what I couldn\u2019t use for useful components to craft with as my adventure progressed.<br><br>Unfortunately Bound by Flames world is not very diverse or expansive.  There are only three landscapes to explore; a forest, ice city and an \u201cotherworld\u201d all made up of corridors.  But it looked good enough and held just enough secrets to peak my interest as I explored it.  My adventure was long enough for me to grow into a flamey badass and wreak havoc on the evil ice lords without becoming bored by the relatively small world and budget graphics, presentation and A.I.  Spiders did a nice job with this one, they used their limited budget wisely and created a captivating if brief and simple world to explore when you are in between AAA RPGs.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30764089', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30764089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30764089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30764089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30764089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30764089', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30764089_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30764089_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30537209\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/HighTech_Cowboy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"159196059\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67447cdb1e84188187cadb9d4d6ae45f4e0cec3b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67447cdb1e84188187cadb9d4d6ae45f4e0cec3b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/67447cdb1e84188187cadb9d4d6ae45f4e0cec3b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/HighTech_Cowboy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"159196059\">HighTech Cowboy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/HighTech_Cowboy\/games\/?tab=all\">208 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/HighTech_Cowboy\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/HighTech_Cowboy\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">158.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 15\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWonderful game though it's not perfect by any stretch. Many of the game mechanics and plot elements aren't as developed as they could be, and the voice acting can be a bit cringe worthy at times.

It's not bad, but at this point it's not really good either.<br>5 - Mid-point. Barely passable. Barely. I can ignore it if the rest is good enough.<br>[ The rest of my scale was not used, so I will not add it. ]<br>What's important to understand is, when I judge a game, I do so taking into account *when* the game was created. Obviously, I don't expect older games to have graphics on par with resent ones, for example.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>Challanging:<br>Smart \u2665\u2665\u2665 me thought to myself, &quot;Hey, I've got about 15 years of RPG experience, I'll just go straight for 'Captain' difficulty! How bad can it be?&quot;...<br>I was an idiot. Bound by Flame, on Captain, proved to be one of the most challanging games I've ever played, by far.<br>Every enemy in this game has it's own mechanics, which encourage a different approach, and on this difficulty, every minion you encounter might be the one that will kill you.<br>This is one of those rare games where you'll find yourself saving, after defeating even the lowliest of minions.<br>It does make winning feel a whole lot greater.<br><br>Graphics:<br>While the graphics are not 'Crysis level', they are pretty good, certainly enjoyable.<br><br>Audio:<br>Great soundtrack, enjoyable to the ear. Comes in complete contrast to the horrifying screams of frustration you will release.<br><br>Choice:<br>You have a decision-based system here that does have an impact on the game, if not 'world-changing'.<br>It's not really like, say, Mass Effect, but it's nice. <br><br>Crafting:<br>The game has a minimal crafting system, not much at all, really,  but just enough as a side-feature to support a game with other focuses.<br>You can use it to create certain consumables, as well as to break items into matirials, and use those matirials for both creating consumables, and upgrading your gear.<br><br>Half-Way-Between-Pro-And-Con:<br>It's worth mentioning that the story-line in the game is nice, I like it, but it does feel like a... Summed up version of a bigger story-line.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>The AI:<br>The AI that &quot;helps&quot; you in the fights, your partners... How do I put this... They are stupid.<br>They are beyond stupid. And mostly useless.<br>They put themselves in danger often, and can't really hold their own for very long.<br><br>Fighting-controls:<br>This is my one main issue with this game. The controls, at least when using a keyboard&amp;mouse, are horrible for fighting.<br>It's not game-breaking at all, it's very duable, you just need to learn how it works, it's just very very annoying.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Highly recommended. Briliant game that is, without a doubt, worth a buy.<br>If you enjoy RPGs so hard you want to comete genocide, this game is for you.<br><br>I hope this is helpful. I am dead tired, superbly happy after finally defeating thew last boss and finishing it, but primarily tired.<br>Ziv.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16753926', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16753926' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16753926\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16753926' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16753926\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16753926', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16753926_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16753926_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t372 of 481 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10118528\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"24126011\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24126011\">[AReV]Nomed<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/games\/?tab=all\">1,057 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/\">32 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">21.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 15, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(TLDR? This review is also available in video format below for your convenience.)<br><br>Developer Spiders is a small studio that isn\u2019t lacking ambition, after what was considered a major disappointment with Mars War Logs, they\u2019ve tried yet again to craft a title whose quality is equal to its ambition with their new fantasy action RPG; Bound By Flame.<br><br>Set in the kingdom of Vertiel, a region besieged by a massive undead army that\u2019s invading from the north. A group of mages known as the Red Scribes think they\u2019ve found a way to combat this threat and are fast at work performing a ritual. You assume the role of Vulcan, a member of the Freeborn Blades, a mercenary group that has been hired to protect the Red Scribes while they conduct their research. Things are quickly interrupted as a Deadwalker army attacks their position and amidst the carnage, something goes wrong with the ritual resulting in Vulcan becoming possessed by a Fire Demon. The Demon talks to you throughout the game, offering advice or seeking to manipulate Vulcan; ultimately playing a part in the game\u2019s moral choices as listening to the Demon can make your character appear more demonic, bolstering magical prowess at the expense of your character\u2019s well-being or you can choose to ignore the Demon and preserve Vulcan\u2019s humanity. Regardless of your decision, it\u2019s clear that Vulcan is the only one able to stand up to the Ice Lords, a group of warmongering necromancers that control the vast undead armies.<br><br>Upon starting the game, you\u2019re greeted with a brief character creation screen which only gives you a few very limited options in terms of designing your character before being awkwardly thrust into an awful tutorial section. This tutorial simply acts to highlight all of the flaws of Bound by Flame along with constant interruptions explaining the game\u2019s various mechanics. You\u2019ll immediately notice a lack of pacing, awkward dialogue and voice acting as well as an unmatched feeling of linearity. This leads to a very poor first impression, however gritting your teeth and pushing through this period of misery has its rewards as the game shows signs of competency later on.<br><br>After completing the tutorial, the half-baked writing immediately improves giving rise to an interesting narrative with surprisingly strong character development. Similar to The Witcher 2 and other titles, you\u2019re faced with moral decisions that can have an effect on the game however these changes are fairly minor comparatively but still add some elements of re-playability. The decisions aren\u2019t cleverly thought out or morally ambiguous like The Witcher 2, instead there\u2019s generally a clear good and evil answer. This still did well to hold my interest and watching Vulcan gradually lose his humanity in favor of becoming more demonic and powerful was a welcomed addition to the game.<br><br>Along with Vulcan, there are several companions that accompany him on his journey. These characters have been greatly improved from Mars War Logs, each having their own developed story however their proficiency in combat remains the same, often dying very quickly and doing very little to aid Vulcan. The option to romance these characters also exists depending on which gender you made Vulcan however there is little development between characters and much less chemistry making romance seem like it was only added to cover all of the features offered by superior RPGs like Mass Effect and Dragon Age.<br><br>Not content to simply borrow the moral choices featured in The Witcher 2, the combat is more or less identical, with two different primary melee attacks along with traps and magic. Parrying and dodging also plays a vital role. The combat while simple is quite satisfying and requires a bit of skill and timing to master. While nowhere near on the level of Dark Souls, it\u2019s still quite solid for an RPG. The RPG elements are surprisingly deep as well, offering three different talent trees along with an in-depth crafting system. There\u2019s a warrior stance that has Vulcan don a 2 hand sword which boosts his parrying and defensive abilities while his ranger stance equips 2 daggers, drastically increasing his speed and stealth capabilities. The third talent tree is directly related to the Demon inside of him, which consists of boosting his magical prowess and fire abilities. Playing on the normal hawk difficulty will provide a reasonable challenge and despite being simple, the combat is definitely the highlight of the game. It isn\u2019t without flaw though as parrying or dodging an attack perfectly will result in Vulcan performing a counter-attack which can sometimes be a detriment to dodging or running away in general. Despite this, the combat is still satisfying and I never felt bored throughout its brief campaign.<br><br>The soundtrack is quite unusual, focusing on a lot of vocal chants mixed with percussion. It still fits the game well and adds to the overall experience. The rest of the audio is hit or miss though, particularly the voice acting. Some characters play the part well, while others are abysmal. It\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s the actor\u2019s fault or just the writing in general as the dialogue can be laughably bad at times. It\u2019s inconsistent in general, particularly the tutorial which almost made me stop playing the game entirely while at other times, I found the narrative, setting, and characters to be engaging. This inconsistency is even apparent in Vulcan\u2019s personality as he can sometimes act like a jerk with no rhyme or reasoning behind it. It leads me to believe that Spiders suffers from having one or two incompetent writers or maybe it\u2019s just a case of poor translation. If this wasn\u2019t enough, the audio can glitch out at times, often causing characters to repeat the same line over and over again.<br><br>The visuals and environments are well done. It\u2019s just a shame that the game is extremely linear as the many sidequests are usually confined to a small area, leaving very little room for exploration. There\u2019s also the odd graphical glitch, such as disappearing textures and pop-in. Despite the graphical overhaul, the facial animations are on-par with Mars War Logs as characters will simply move their lips while giving a blank expressionless stare.<br><br>Borrowing from The Witcher again, the game tries to separate itself into acts. Upon arriving at a new location, Vulcan will be given a host of sidequests to complete while simultaneously progressing the main story until he completes the area and moves on. Unfortunately, the game is rather short for an action RPG, running around 15 hours if you complete all of the sidequests. The poor writing rears its ugly head once more before the game's credits roll, as there\u2019s quite a bit of buildup, and without spoiling anything, the game ends rather abruptly when there easily could have been room for another 10-20 hours of content. <br><br>Ultimately, Bound By Flame is greater than the sum of its parts and certainly an improvement over Mars War Logs as it features a solid narrative, refined combat system and deep RPG elements. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, although once again a bit too ambitious a project for Spiders to handle. Although it has many flaws, it is still an enjoyable experience but let\u2019s just hope they hire some better writers next time. <br><br>This review is also available in video format if you don\u2019t feel like reading all of this:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cVo2Oc0fRGY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cVo2Oc0fRGY<\/a><br><br>Pros<br>+ Interesting Narrative &amp;

It strikes me as doing a disservice to the work, and more to the point, as being critically lazy. The problem when discussing something like Bound by Flame, then, is that you really can\u2019t get around doing so, because it is very deliberately meant to be a low-priced spin on Dragon Age. <br><br>It\u2019s got enough of its own merits that it comes off as a homage or a work by fans rather than a deliberate case of follow-the-leader, with a surprisingly funny script, although it completely loses focus as you move into the third chapter, and a combat engine that has some genuinely interesting ideas built into it. The problem is that it\u2019s not quite done yet, although there\u2019s enough here that a theoretical sequel could be something special. <br><br>The player in Bound by Flame is Vulcan, a build-your-own hero in the Bioware tradition who has given up his or her previous life to serve as a demolitions specialist in a mercenary company called the Freeborn Blades. The Blades, as the game starts, are one of the only surviving organized groups in the world of Vertiel, which is currently under siege by an army of undead led by the Lords of Ice. Most nations have fallen, with the elves left as the last civilization standing, and all the Lords have to do is cleanup. <br><br>The Blades are hired to provide security for another organization, the Red Scribes, as they conduct a ritual that\u2019s meant to provide some last chance at survival, if not victory. Vulcan\u2019s in the wrong place at the wrong time as the ritual concludes and ends up as the unwitting host of a previously-unknown entity: a demon with powers over flame. <br><br>The central ethical issue in Bound by Flame is how much free rein you\u2019re going to give the demon. The more power you get from it, the more it changes Vulcan\u2019s body; soon your skin darkens to black, you sprout horns, and you end up with parts of your body constantly on fire. If you side with the surviving humans and try to save as many of them as you can along the way, you deny the demon. If you listen to its advice and ignore all other concerns in the name of gaining enough power to challenge the Lords directly, you give the demon what it wants. <br><br>The demon\u2019s abilities represent one of three skill trees that are available to you. The Warrior tree uses a single two-handed sword and focuses on damage resistance, sheer power, and delivering massive damage with a few slow swings. The Ranger tree combines stealth and rapid attacks into a sort of swashbuckler option, sacrificing damage resistance in favor of dodges and counterattacks. Finally, the Pyromancer tree provides you with ways to set the undead on fire. <br><br>You can switch between the three skill trees at will and improve each one point by point every time you level up. Each has an ultimate ability that\u2019s unlocked when you invest at least 24 points into it, and heavy investment in a single tree makes the game a very different experience. In practice, you\u2019re going to be a Warrior or Ranger with occasional points spent in Pyromancer, and both approaches are intuitive and reasonably fun with a little practice. The enemies telegraph their attacks far enough in advance that you can figure out ways to deal with them, and you have a number of alternate options like explosive traps and a crossbow that you can use to help even the odds. <br><br>If anything, the skill trees are too top-heavy. If you try to spread your points around, the early areas will prove difficult. You really want to improve Burning Weapon as fast as you can, because even standard enemies tend to have tons of health, and whatever you can do to whittle them down is worth doing. <br><br>In fact, one of the major criticisms I have of Bound by Flame is its difficulty. The combat system feels pretty good once you get used to it, but any enemy with the ability to knock you down can easily kill you, and there won\u2019t be much you can do about it. Some kind of rapid recovery or roll would go a long way towards removing the frustration.<br><br>You can have a companion NPC with you for most of the game, but they\u2019re usually not a factor aside from absorbing a few stray hits; enemies usually mob your companion straight away and kill him or her, then turn to you once they\u2019re done. You have to work around that tendency for companions to be worth a damn. They all seem to have a death wish, and it\u2019s rare that they survive even a simple fight. In short, Bound by Flame feels like it\u2019s harder than it needs to be. Standard enemies are tough enough to kill you in a few lucky hits, bosses can send you flying or corner you with little difficulty, and it\u2019s rare that a death feels fair. <br><br>The graphics don\u2019t necessarily impress strictly from a technical standpoint. You won\u2019t be wowed by intricate detail or uber-authentic realism. You might even find the dark, forbidding world oppressive. Even so, there are many who will appreciate such an atmosphere, as the ambiance fits the action perfectly, and the style is what you\u2019d expect from a fantastical, medieval-type adventure. <br><br>The sound fluctuates between some generic hack \u2018n slash combat effects and an inspired soundtrack that really takes shape during dangerous encounters. On the plus side, I don\u2019t usually notice the musical score in such games, but I definitely noticed this one. It ratcheted up the intensity a few notches, and it\u2019s not overly repetitive. The voice acting is largely forgettable, but overall, the audio and graphics work together to present the player with a world that demands our attention. <br><br>All in all, Bound by Flame is a really fun game taken down only by its not-so-great story and voice acting. If that\u2019s something you can get past to play a good action RPG, then this is surely a game you should have no qualms about picking up. If you\u2019re more inclined to wince and shudder at poor dialogue and acting, then I suggest you give this one a pass.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20920540', 'summary' );

It strikes me as doing a disservice to the work, and more to the point, as being critically lazy. The problem when discussing something like Bound by Flame, then, is that you really can\u2019t get around doing so, because it is very deliberately meant to be a low-priced spin on Dragon Age. It\u2019s got enough of its own merits that it comes off as a homage or a work by fans rather than a deliberate case of follow-the-leader, with a surprisingly funny script, although it completely loses focus as you move into the third chapter, and a combat engine that has some genuinely interesting ideas built into it. The problem is that it\u2019s not quite done yet, although there\u2019s enough here that a theoretical sequel could be something special.<br><br>The player in Bound by Flame is Vulcan, a build-your-own hero in the Bioware tradition who has given up his or her previous life to serve as a demolitions specialist in a mercenary company called the Freeborn Blades. The Blades, as the game starts, are one of the only surviving organized groups in the world of Vertiel, which is currently under siege by an army of undead led by the Lords of Ice. Most nations have fallen, with the elves left as the last civilization standing, and all the Lords have to do is bat cleanup.<br> <br>The Blades are hired to provide security for another organization, the Red Scribes, as they conduct a ritual that\u2019s meant to provide some last chance at survival, if not victory. Vulcan\u2019s in the wrong place at the wrong time as the ritual concludes and ends up as the unwitting host of a previously-unknown entity: a demon with powers over flame.<br> <br>The central ethical issue in Bound by Flame is how much free rein you\u2019re going to give the demon. The more power you get from it, the more it changes Vulcan\u2019s body; soon your skin darkens to black, you sprout horns, and you end up with parts of your body constantly on fire. If you side with the surviving humans and try to save as many of them as you can along the way, you deny the demon. If you listen to its advice and ignore all other concerns in the name of gaining enough power to challenge the Lords directly, you give the demon what it wants.<br><br>The demon\u2019s abilities represent one of three skill trees that are available to you. The Warrior tree uses a single two-handed sword and focuses on damage resistance, sheer power, and delivering massive damage with a few slow swings. The Ranger tree combines stealth and rapid attacks into a sort of swashbuckler option, sacrificing damage resistance in favor of dodges and counterattacks. Finally, the Pyromancer tree provides you with a hundred and one ways to set undead on fire.<br> <br>You can switch between the three skill trees at will and improve each one point by point every time you level up. Each has an ultimate ability that\u2019s unlocked when you invest at least 24 points into it, and heavy investment in a single tree makes the game a very different experience. In practice, you\u2019re going to be a Warrior or Ranger with occasional points spent in Pyromancer, and both approaches are intuitive and reasonably fun with a little practice. The enemies telegraph their attacks far enough in advance that you can figure out ways to deal with them, and you have a number of alternate options like explosive traps and a crossbow that you can use to help even the odds.<br> <br>If anything, the skill trees are too top-heavy. If you try to spread your points around, the early areas will prove difficult. You really want to improve Burning Weapon as fast as you can, because even standard enemies tend to have tons of health, and whatever you can do to whittle them down is worth doing.<br><br>In fact, one of the major criticisms I have of Bound by Flame is its difficulty. The combat system feels pretty good once you get used to it, but any enemy with the ability to knock you down can easily kill you, and there won\u2019t be much you can do about it. Some kind of rapid recovery or roll would go a long way towards removing the frustration.<br> <br>You can have a companion NPC with you for most of the game, but they\u2019re usually not a factor aside from absorbing a few stray hits; enemies usually mob your companion straight away and kill him or her, then turn to you once they\u2019re done. You have to work around that tendency for companions to be worth a damn. They all seem to have a death wish, and it\u2019s rare that they survive even a simple fight.<br><br>In short, Bound by Flame feels like it\u2019s harder than it needs to be. Standard enemies are tough enough to kill you in a few lucky hits, bosses can send you flying or corner you with little difficulty, and it\u2019s rare that a death feels fair. Combined with the script losing cohesion at around the halfway point, Bound by Flame has an unfinished, generally unpolished feel that sometimes makes it a frustrating game to play.<br><br>It\u2019s entertaining enough despite its faults that it\u2019s worth checking out. If Spiders gets the chance to put together a sequel, with a more cohesive story and another pass or two on the combat system, this could be the start of a fun series.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Recommended<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13488424', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13488424' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13488424\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13488424' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13488424\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13488424', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13488424_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13488424_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24143939\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"69814719\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5dd8d3e1bf6bc99f180794f4c877ed0d3322a8b7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5dd8d3e1bf6bc99f180794f4c877ed0d3322a8b7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5d\/5dd8d3e1bf6bc99f180794f4c877ed0d3322a8b7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/\" data-miniprofile=\"69814719\">PrinzEugen<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/games\/?tab=all\">616 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/recommended\/\">77 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030080447\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">34.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Enjoyable but rather one-sided action-rpg.<\/b><br><br><i>Bound by Flame<\/i> is an action-rpg developed by Spiders Entertainment, the company that recently gave us <i>The Technomancer<\/i>. The game was released in May 2014 to subdued critical acclaim: currently it stands at 65% positive user-reviews on Steam and it only received a 56% score at Metacritic. Judging by those figures, it wouldn't seem like a game worthy to give a thorough playthrough, but in the end I am very glad I gave it a proper try.<br><br>The developers at Spiders, a small- to mid-size company, surely have been specializing in action-rpg's over the past couple of years. And their experience does show in <i>Bound by Flame<\/i>. At first sight, and during its first minutes of playing, the game doesn't feel special, or even good, at all. The story is once more one about the player having to save the world, this time against a horde of deadly Ice-Lords. The only twist is that as the protagonist you are possessed by a demon, and that by giving in or resisting to that entity, you can influence character development and playstyle (but only to a certain degree).<br><br>The story itself is by no means original and got only a couple of interesting twists during the 30 hours or so that my playthrough lasted. The different characters, most of them companions or allies in your combat against the evil Ice Lords, are hardly fleshed out at all \u2013 most of them are drawn inside the well-known lines of knight, archer or mage without any real personality. Happily, there are a few exceptions, such as an hilariously funny undead king, who peppers the latter part of the game with some wonderful lines which made me laugh out loud. This kind of black humour was an unexpected element of the game, and definitely helped me to get past some of its more repetitive parts.<br><br>Character development is pretty well done: by leveling up, one can spend attribute points, which can be put into one of three perk trees. One is warrior-like, focusing on two-handed combat, the other one is perfect for a more agile character, and finally there is a magic skilltree which unlocks both defensive and offensive fire magic. In combination with craftable weapons and armor, this offers a kind of rpg-light experience \u2013 not on the highest or deepest level, but still enjoyable nonetheless.<br><br>The one department where <i>Bound by Flame<\/i> really shines, is in its smooth and very intuitive  combat. Playing with an Xbox 360-controller, the combat proved to be both exceptionally fluid and very rewarding. Running into battle without thinking would mostly result in a quick death, so a plan of action and some preparation was often needed. Good use of the available means \u2013 skills, potions and quick actions such as parry or jump back \u2013 turned out to be essential on several occasions, and learning to use them as efficiently as possible was very rewarding indeed. Several boss-like characters offered quite a challenge; some of them even drove me close to the point of giving up, but I'm glad I persisted. Neither graphically or in its audio department does <i>Bound by Flame<\/i> shine, but it doesn't drop any major points here either.<br><br>All in all, this game is more than the sum of its parts: the extremely well implemented combat manages to lift it to a higher level, and although there is nearly not enough variety in environments or in enemies, it managed to hold my interest right to the end.<br><br><b>Recommended to everyone who likes challenging action more than the role-playing in an a-rpg.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24143939', 'summary' );

The actual game play represents a classic Action Game, consisting all of the usuals, heavy attacks, blocks, swipe attacks, as well as your magic abilities. The combt system can feel a little clunky to begin with, but once you work out the timings on when to block and parry attacks, it's OK. <br><br>I would say the mainstory is a little short for the price tag. I finished the game in just under fourteen hours. I would highly recommend you finish the majority of the side missions as to get a few levels advantage over the story, as some of the end bosses are quite challenging. <br><br>That being said, the bosses in Bound by Flame have a very Dark Souls'esk feel to them. You have to work out the best stratergy to take them down, often resulting in a number of failed attempts before it finally clicks. <br><br>All in all, this is a pretty good game, but I would wait until sale season starts before you pick it up since it is certainly not worth the full price tag.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12979550', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12979550' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12979550\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12979550' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12979550\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12979550', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12979550_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12979550_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30882594\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198173693499\/recommended\/243930\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"213427771\">Rework on profile<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Bound By Flame for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI like this game, but i think there is lot of what to improve , what rll huts my eyes is game camera in combat ...

The whole armor\/weapon upgrade system through crafting is pretty sweet and the story seems decent enough, as do the combat skills. But the graphics are a bit too overcontrasty and red filtered for my tastes lol.<br><br>That and the character models\/voice acting\/animations remind me of Dragon Age 1 and they don't seem to fit too well with eachother imo.<br><br>Combat is pretty good IF you can used to it. It's like a mix of the Witcher 1 (with the DDR style timed stuff that triggers combos) and Dark Souls (with the block\/slash\/dodge at the right time or you die) but it doesn't feel refined enough to me. Still though it does work as long as you get the timing right and the right skills in at the right time. Health is a bit hard to restore though seeing as the potions require materials that are a bit hard to come by in early game areas, but there are traits or talent points that can be used to get more mats out of everything.<br><br>I dunno, I might give it another go some day and see if I can get into it properly.
