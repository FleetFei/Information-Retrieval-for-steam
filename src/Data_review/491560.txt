It is not a &quot;real pinball game&quot;.<br><br>It's cute and relatively polished. The art is nice and clean.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br>There are 9 story levels, which are quite short and simple, consisting of multiple playfields divided by checkpoints that are unlocked by completing goals on each playfield. Some segments involved the character flying through a scrolling area instead of being controlled by flippers as a ball.<br><br>There is a simple, cute story featuring a handful of characters, all of which actually take part in the gameplay itself either as enemies or helpers (there are some multiball sequences).<br><br>The playfield design includes elements like collectible stars, breakable objects, and enemies that move around and sometimes shoot at or push the character\/ball. In some levels, you have 3 lives and can be killed.<br><br>The enemy fights (there's really only one type besides the boss fight, which is also similar) are cleverly designed to require an initial shot at an object, followed by a timed shot at the enemy. Again, the enemies also move toward and try to push you, and sometimes will shoot things at you. The normal enemies can be stunned by shooting them directly (but killing them requires the aforementioned sequence).<br><br>Each story level has 5 challenges, but only one is available at a time and they must be completed in order. The first one is always to simply complete the level. There is considerable variety in the challenges including time attack, collection, finding secrets, and a few creative ones like flying in between stars instead of through them in one of the scrolling segments.<br><br>The 3 bonus levels are one pachinko with finite balls, one endless? pinball, and one (endless?) non-pinball vertical scroller).<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Difficulty \/ Goals \/ Score<\/div><br>Simply getting through all the story levels is pretty easy. Perhaps some will find the last level to be somewhat difficult (I found it to be a mild challenge compared to the rest, but didn't have much trouble).<br><br>However, many of the challenges are very difficult, even for me (a pinball veteran with a tendency to appear near the top of leaderboards). Unfortunately the source of the difficulty doesn't have all that much to do with pinball skills. Sometimes it has to do with randomness - a bit too much so, in my opinion. Sometimes it has to do with non-pinball segments. I think the difficulty of some of the challenges could really use some tweaking.<br><br>One of the achievements is for completing every challenge. This is certainly by far the hardest one.<br><br>There is also an achievement for obtaining a 3 star rating on every story level (bonus levels also have star ratings, but do not seem to count towards this achievement). The other achievements are either trivially easy or are a grind (most notably the achievement requiring playing through levels 500 times! - beware!)<br><br>Star ratings are based on score, which is based on time to complete the level, collecting stars in the level, breaking objects, and hitting the bumpers until they stop giving points.<br><br>The story levels have Steam integrated leaderboards. Strangely the bonus levels do not have leaderboards despite being much more score oriented in design (2\/3 even have uncapped scoring, unlike all the other levels).<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Physics<\/div><br>The physics are super basic. The &quot;ball&quot; moves very slowly and rarely bounces, which reduces the array of pinball skills employed to flipping at the right time - but even there, the ball's trajectory and force doesn't really follow what you'd expect from &quot;normal&quot; pinball. In particular, backhand shots are nearly impossible and transferring the ball between flippers is very awkward and time consuming most of the time.<br><br>The bottom line is that you are not afforded a particularly good sense of control due to the limitations of the physics despite the very slow speed of the ball.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Issues<\/div><br>Overall the game is pretty solid.<br><br>There's some odd physics object penetration and hit detection sometimes, but it's a minor quirk.<br><br>I did notice some model flicker occasionally. Seems others see it too, but not sure if it's universal. It's tolerable, though, and possibly tends to occur after the game has been running for some time.<br><br>Noticed a few very, very minor interface issues that hopefully will get fixed (arguably incorrect text in one place, two achievements not showing as unlocked in the in-game interface, but unlocking fine in Steam).<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div><br>It's a fun little game, with emphasis on &quot;little&quot;.<br><br>Recommended for anyone, just don't expect too much and keep in mind what this game is and is not.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25557476', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25557476' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25557476\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25557476' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25557476\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25557476', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25557476_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25557476_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/491560\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">13 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25536657\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/261d1b98710ba5045394f965ce0997cc8f049d80_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/\" data-miniprofile=\"180034122\">foofaraw<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/games\/?tab=all\">1,134 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/\">102 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198140299850\/recommended\/491560\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis player just exited Momonga Pinball Adventures after 64 minutes, in order to write this review (and consider my future of play with this game. As far as going back in\u2026.yet undecided.) It\u2019s an extremely CUTE game, no question about it, and for beginners to pinball, it may be just the ticket. But it offers little along the traditional lines of pinball play or scoring, and instead perhaps might be considered pinball\u2019s first PURELY Steam pinball-hybrid game.<br><br>To get started in this game; if anyone else looks for the keys to use, as I did, you may fail as thoroughly as I. Here\u2019s all you need; left, right and down arrows. That\u2019s it. And for those beginners previously mentioned there are numerous \u201cvaluable hints\u201d offered throughout the game. For example, that the ball goes faster off the tip of the flipper. Or that the ball can be caught by the flippers. (Really good stuff for beginners to know.) The game is the story of cute fuzzy creatures, primarily a flying squirrel named Momo, as they fight the forces of evil.......owls.<br><br>Momonga Pinball Adventures (MPA) is broken into nine levels. Each level needs to be completed for story continuation, and also has four more accomplishments for optimal completion and scoring. There are also three other mini-games that will be unlocked as the game progresses. Frequently (in fact, very frequently) cut-scenes interrupt the flow of the game to interject story that may or may not add to gameplay, depending on the player. Stars obtained by ball contact count as points (as well as contact with set pieces), even though stars are often obtained by soaring through the skies, entirely independent of pinball. Each of nine levels as well as having five accomplishments, also has three overall levels of accomplishment represented by hearts. For a yet undetermined reason (just at an hour, remember), a timer runs as play occurs. So if you\u2019re a player obsessed with competition and measuring accomplishment, MPA just may be the game for you. Oh, BTW, there are also ten achievements and an online leaderboard, so certainly this pinball game, perhaps like no other, was designed for Steam-style gamers.<br><br>As far as pinball, well, not really. It doesn\u2019t feel, act or perform as pinball. I never had &quot;pinball fun&quot;. I rushed through the first seven levels, plus the mini-games, plus time on Level 8 in less than 50 minutes. Then the bigger boss level comes along, presenting a challenge that at first blush seems way out of scale to all prior levels. MPA advertises itself on the Store Page as \u201ca unique pinball game\u201d, but another game has already taken, and held, the title of Original RPG Pinball game for almost two years. (And in truth, the original feels far more like actual pinball, though admittedly at a significantly higher price.)<br><br>Momonga is what it claims to be, and at a reasonable price. For players looking for a cute game in which to search specifically for measured accomplishment, one could do far worse. But for those wanting primarily to play pinball, I fear MPA may be a disappointment.<br><br>Thank you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25536657', 'summary' );

There's a note on the OSX graphics settings recomending using a certain graphics level - I tested all of them and they all have the same issues. Lots of images and textures seem to flash white; images in the loading screen, images in the cutscenes, some textures during gameplay, even the buttons in the main menu. It's too distracting to really enjoy the game right now, but it has a lot of potential and I'll definitely return to it once it's fixed. When the images aren't flashing, I love the art style, it reminds me of cute action adventure games on the PS2. Recommending to others on Windows, hold off for a bit on OSX\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25539400', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25539400' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25539400\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25539400' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25539400\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25539400', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25539400_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25539400_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/491560\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 9 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25557476","25536657","25545718","25539400"]}
