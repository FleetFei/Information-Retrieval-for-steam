You might be pleasantly surprised by the setting though. <br><br><b>So what is this game then?<\/b><br><br>It calls itself the spiritual successor of Planescape Torment, a beloved, text-heavy old rpg which is a lesser known but much loved game in the genre.<br><br>In nearly every conversation I've had with another gamer who said he liked rpg's I've probably said: \u201cYeah, that's cool, but have you ever played Planescape Torment?\u201d If he\/she said \u201cyes offcourse!\u201d and I was drunk I probably hugged him or her. <br><br>I should stop asking that question \u2026 <br><br>If you enjoyed Planescape Torment you've probably backed this game so this review is rather pointless but you like reading wall's of text, clicking a button afterwards and influencing the world around you so, be my guest, and keep on reading. <br><br><b>Is this game something for me then?<\/b><br><br>I honestly don't know. It might be if you like exploring locations, talking to npc's, reading item descriptions and diving, head-on, into a world you haven't seen before.<br><br>The one thing I can assure you that you have never played a game like this one before.<br>Wether that's a good or bad thing is up in the air though. Like everything in life, the game is a mixed bag. Sometimes it shines and sometimes it stinks. Currently (06\/03\/2017) the game still has several annoying bugs, combat is repetitive, cumbersome and will test your patience. <br><br>It delivers on the text heavy style of its spiritual predecessor but unfortunately the story, although well told, isn't as good. Where Planescape left the downtrodden path of most rpg's where you're the focal point of the world who has to save the town\/country\/the world\/planes of existence\/ reality itself from a certain evil and his macguffin. Planescape told a personal story of a man trying to find the bane of his own existence, Tides manages to rehash the standard rpg story from the get go.<br><br> You're a castoff, on the run from or towards, depending on your point of view, of a big evil who threatens you and every one of your kind and the key to all this is, you guessed it, a certain macguffin that you need to repair. <br><br>Thankfully the creators, for the most part, told this story in a interesting setting and  there are several memorable gems in the dialogues with npc's and companions<br><br><b>Why a positive score if you're mostly negative?<\/b><br><br>In a world without Planescape this game would have blown me away, in a world with Planescape it only rattled my cage. It was an interesting ride and if you, someday, want to play something that's more different then most rpg's then atleast put this game in your wish list.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30347900', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30347900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30347900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30347900' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30347900\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30347900', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30347900_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30347900_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t110 of 163 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30408203\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alphyna\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"49951650\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36e0e07e65cc3b314ee86392bb0f640f14fd1d7d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36e0e07e65cc3b314ee86392bb0f640f14fd1d7d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36e0e07e65cc3b314ee86392bb0f640f14fd1d7d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alphyna\/\" data-miniprofile=\"49951650\">alphyna<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alphyna\/games\/?tab=all\">182 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alphyna\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alphyna\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">67.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst thing first: TToN is not an RPG. It's a story-driven adventure game and should be judged as such. Its progression type is actually that of a point-and-click game: you get a hub, you find the correct order to click things, you uncover the plot and then move to the next area.<br><br>This is all fine in my book, but should be kept in mind.<br><br>Sadly, the game has a bunch of glaring downsides:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>The visuals are imaginative, but poorly-executed<br>  <\/li><li>The balance is atrocious (as others have mentioned, most challenges in TToN are basically non-challenges and have no reason to be there)<br>  <\/li><li>The whole game feels clunky in a bad way<br>  <\/li><li>Glitches abound<br>  <\/li><li>Non-plot Meres seem to be pointless<br>  <\/li><li>It's obvious that the game was written by many different writers with different styles.<\/li><\/ul><br>Does this all make the game unworthy of playing? No. Unworthy of its price tag? Yeah, perhaps.<br><br>Trying to remember PST without nostalgia goggles, I'd actually say that TToN does a good job of capturing the spirit of the now-franchise. You get the sense of a huge and wondrous world with plots and events criss-crossing each other\u2014and there you are, thrown in the thick of it, your head spinning from the weirdness that surrounds you. This feeling is strongly enhanced by the fact that the game <b>rarely repeats the assets<\/b>\u2014meaning that most characters and situations you'll encounter will have unique models, scripts, and so on. The lack of junk content makes the world feel rich and true.<br><br>TToN actually builds upon PST's methods, trying little neat tricks to make everything seem... I wouldn't say &quot;more natural&quot;, but rather &quot;more engaging&quot;. You get dialogue options that are only available once. You get failure states more interesting than successes. You get hidden timers that make certain events change and unfold. <i>You can never be sure.<\/i> All these things are great improvements over PST.<br><br>Another thing that captures the spirit of the old game to a T is the soundtrack. Reserved, non-grandiose, yet full of genuine tingling sorrow, it seemed perfect.<br><br>Honorable mentions to some other elements of the game:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>The Bloom is dark and imaginative, rivalling the best moments of the whole PST setting; a brilliant concept that was well-executed<br>  <\/li><li>The &quot;Ashen Imitation&quot; quest (the one with the same girl being reborn over and over) intrigued me greatly<br>  <\/li><li>The replacement of monetary rewards with Oddities (pointless items that exist only to be sold\u2014so they're basically shins, but flavourful)<br>  <\/li><li>Some writing is quite captivating (The Genocide) or funny (&quot;coital cluster&quot;)<br>  <\/li><li>Companions have a lot of dialogue and react to A LOT OF things happening in the game<br>  <\/li><li>How Perception and other unasked-for checks are done, making you feel super smart every time they trigger<br>  <\/li><li>Some Crises are very engaging (like the one where you need to retrieve the Cortex)<br>  <\/li><li>The quiet, fanfare-less moment when you find Chile<br>  <\/li><li>Erritis<\/li><\/ul><br><b>A WORD ABOUT COMPANIONS<\/b><br>They're okay. The game features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Two well-executed typecast fan service characters (the &quot;naive little girl you need to protect&quot; Rhin and the &quot;charming rogue with a tragic backstory&quot; Tybir)<br>  <\/li><li>A rather bland companion who's important to the plot (Matkina)<br>  <\/li><li>Two characters who seemed very bland apart from the beginning (Callistege and Aliger)<br>  <\/li><li>A brilliant character who only shines if you use a particular skill\u2014a skill that I actually found detrimental to the rest of the game since the explication of characters' thoughts destroys the whole point of fiction in all cases but Erritis's<\/li><\/ul><br>They're less original than in PST, but way more fully-realized. However, for some inexplicable reason they are also all human.<br><br><b>THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM<\/b><br>Now, like I said, I do recommend this game. For all its downsides, it's more than worth your time if you just want to immerse yourself in the Ninth World and play an adventure game of epic scale.<br><br>But\u2014and there's no way to put in lightly\u2014the main plot sucks.<br><br>I'm not talking about the writing, although I did find the major plot scenes to be among the less well-executed. But that, once again, would be forgivable... if the game didn't spend its second half to destroy the great premise of the first half.<br><br>You start as a person in a startling, but not unique, situation: you are a shell of a body, cast off by your creator who jumps vessels to stay immortal. You are not special in any existential way\u2014however, you are technically the best candidate to oppose The Changing God\/Sorrow, since each new body he makes is better than the previous ones, so you're the best among your brethren. Sounds like a great &quot;fit for this story, but not The Chosen One&quot; setup.<br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Oh, only you are The Chosen One, because your skills and body are unique\u2014no one else could have triggered the events of the ending. And the tutorial guy is actually The Changing God, your creator. Oh, no, he isn't. The brilliant yet narcissistic and ruthless Changing God, so excuisitely built up at the beginning? He shows neitehr brilliance nor ruthlessness\u2014he's actually a lost and sensitive guy who started this whole mess to revive his sick daughter. Only he's not trying to revive her. And he's actually dead, because... reasons. Why was he even running from death so hard? What was his personality like? We don't know for sure, he never gets much of a spotlight. And that looming thing that's hunting him, called the effing SORROW? Nope, no metaphors, it's an ancient guardian or something. There to protect the Tides, that are a gameplay mechanic, but not really explained to you. Did you use Tidal Surge? Did we tell you it was bad, even though we never told you how and it had no repercussions? Yeah, now decide stuff in an ending that fully revolves around dilemmas and entities that were not explored in the game at all.<\/span><\/span><br><br>Basically, it's a mess of &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; proportions. In the third act, new entities get shoved down your throat one after the other, every new screen is a revelation that turns the plot on its head... leaving you confused and the game, robbed of focus.<br><br><b>THE TRUNK OF THE ELEPHANT<\/b><br>With all its oddness and quirkiness, down below PST was a very simple, almost Hollywood-like story of redemption. The question it asked was Shakespearean in its simplicity: <i>Is there a fate worse then death?<\/i> And the bittersweet yet fulfilling answer was, <i>Yes<\/i>.

Furthermore, after much thought, I do not reccomened it for what it claims to be. This is no Planescape: Torment and it is not a worthy successor. Nevertheless, there is something worth the time it takes to play, even if it is deeply flawed. Below is my first formal attempt at a review, which I have tried to do indepth and professionally as possible.<br><br>At the conclusion, there will be a numerical score with a breakdown for my reasoning behind it.<br><br>---<br>Background<br>---<br><br>I backed this game for a sum of forty dollars the week it was announced. I discovered the kickstarter just as I was finishing Planescape: Torment, the last of the great CRPG classics that I was cleaning out of my backlogue. Starting with Baldurs Gate, I have gone through that entire series, the Neverwinters, the Icewind Dales, Arcanum, and had also played entirety of the newer roleplaying games of both high and low prominence, such as Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Jade Empire, Inquisitor, Knights of the Old Republic, and was also following the development of Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Age of Decadence, and so on and so forth.<br><br>I was one of the cautiously surprised wave surfers of the &quot;age of incline&quot; or the &quot;new golden age of RPGs.&quot; And Planescape: Torment had just become the crown jewel and the capstone of that period of my life before the new era began.<br><br>Should a developer or InXile affiliate read this, I have a personal note. This was my first Kickstarter I ever participated in, and I was very hesitant to lay down that much (or any) money for any project. While my tier was low as far as backers go, it was a lot of money for me, considering that I was funding my own education at the time and came from a poor background. So I placed a lot of value in this game. During the years it took for T:TON to be developed, I went through multiple rough patches where suicide seemed to be the answer. Yet thought that persisted in my mind when I came close to doing something drastic was that I would never see the return on this monetary investment, and I didn't want to die after wasting thirty five \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing bucks. So yeah. I'm not claiming T:TON saved my life. It didn't. I had other reasons or pulling through in the end, but it was one of many minor things that kept me going.<br><br>---<br>Development, Production, and Publishing<br>---<br>Hype was generated through regular Kickstart updates and YouTube videos with lofty promises, but I have always been a pessimist and I decided early to not buy in. Many did, however, and ended up donating even more.<br><br>In the months to come, major cuts of important goals were promsied, but never mentioned. These were things that people donated for with expectation of their deliverance. It would have been forgivable if they had been straightforward and transparant about it, but they were not. A backer had to discover it and confront them before it was admitted.<br><br>An apology is owed to the backers. This is a shameful incident. Luckily, they managed to salavage (from whatever unknown difficulty and strife was responsible for these cuts) a decent game that delivers an excellent story.<br><br>They acceped a publishing contract with Techland  who, if I have the story correct, was responsible for the decision to port it to XBox-One and PS4, and footed the bill for the ports. The game was promised to be optimized for PC. In the end, it was not.<br><br>Of note, the Italians were also screwed over and never got a translation, as they were promised.<br><br>In the end, the hype:delivery ratio would make Todd Howard proud.<br><br><br>---<br>Review<br>---<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Artistic Visuals:  First off, the enviromental visuals are utterly fantastic in my opinion. The otherwordly vibe of official Numenera artwork and universe is captured perfectly. Every single location in the game seems irreplacible unique and incomparable to other settings. This is most definitely a worthy introduction to the surreal beauty of Numenera. +2<br><br><\/li><li>GUI: In stark contract, the GUI is minimalistic most of the time, and overwhelming at other times. Thankfully, this game is not one that is reliant on the GUI to be playable. During exploration, it is very clean. Perhaps a little too clean. During dialogue, the box is far too large. It is visually appalling and sometimes even detrimental to the actions being described, as characters and objects are often cut off and sometimes not visible at all.<br><br>A classic CRPG feature is pressing a 'tab' to highlight all objects. Here it is absolutely overwhelming. Every name is enshrined in a massive decoration that is unecessary, while everything else is covered in an icon indicating its purpose. It doesn't simply highlight, it adds a whole new layer of buttons and symbols, along with respective text labels for all of them.<br><br>There is also no way to see where a scene transition is going to take you without consulting your map, which is on a separate screen<br><br>The CYOA UI of Meres is nice, but I've heard of some bugs at higher resolutions. -.5<br><br><\/li><li> Combat: I'm not going to go into depth here due to the character limit, but it is mediocre at best and flat out atrocious at worst. It is not a focus of the game, but it is still a feature. A bad feature. -.8<br><br><\/li><li> Writing: Varies wildly. Most tertiery background characters and minor antagonists recieve the most depth, while most companions are lacking in enough dialogue to make them feel human. The main characters, such as the Changing God, the Sorrow,  and the Last Castoff are tragically the worst written. Rhin, Erritis, Tyber, Inifere, and the Bloom are the best characterized.<br><br>It frequently devolves into adjective porn and purple prose. More edits should have been done. I have a large vocabulary and was able to understand everything in the game without consulting a dictionary, but there were some cases of uneeded verbosity. However, what is actually being written, is indeed literary. Reminiscent of Gene Wolfe in particular, and yes, even PS:T. +3.3, -.7<br><br><\/li><li> Story\/Plot: It is definitely not on par with PS:T, but it isn't entirely dissociated from it. It is excellent for the era it was released in. This is a cut above Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Sword of Dragonspear, etc. On par with Age of Decadence, with better writing. However, it tries to be too different AND too similar to PS:T at the exact same time. The epynonymous &quot;torment&quot; element is particularly lacking. +4, -.2<br><br><\/li><li> Choice and Consequence: Average. It delivers what should be expected of all story heavy RPGs. Not as hyperreactive as promised, however. +0, -0<br><br><\/li><li> Pacing: Sagus Cliffs is the only decently paced area in the entire game and the ending feels rushed due to cut content that would have filled the gaps. -.3<br><br><\/li><li> Levels: The non-linearity and linearity is unbalanced, again, due to cut content again. But the content of them is rife with well designed quests, and non-quest exploration that is rewarded and engaging. Size varies, but feels right in the end. The Bloom is fantastic. +2, -.5<br><br><\/li><li> Mechanics: Stat Pools are laughable and easily abused, but are drained enough to need management. There is a bias towards being a nano and getting their mind reading abilities, but overall, the games skills are balanced and are checked often. They add a lot in the end. -.4, +.5<br><br><\/li><li> Bugs: Minor ones still present during writing of review, but nothing that will ruin your game. But some annoying ones none the less. -.2<\/li><\/ul><br>---<br>Score: 6.9\/10 <br>PS:T's score: 9.5\/10<br>---<br><br><br>Go in with zero expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It has an amazing world with a capitvating story. Expect what was promised, and you'll be very disappointed. This is one of the better examples of the RPG 'renaissance,' but a crude imitation of its inspiration, riddled with inconsistent quality, a bad development history and broken promises. I felt like it was worth my time, but I did not feel satisfied due to how much better it could have been.

After a successful kickstarter campaign, and several delays, the game is finally out. But how well does it hold up?<br><br><br>What sets Torment apart from most other CRPGs is the amount of reading you have to do. There's not a whole lot of combat in this game, and what is in there can usually be avoided through dialogue or skillchecks.<br><br><br><b>Graphics &amp; sound<\/b><br>Torment tries to emulate the look of the old infinity engine games, but with a more modern coat of paint. The result are some beautiful, and very imaginative looking environments, that look both familiar, and unlike anything I've seen in another game. The art style is consistently strong, and the environments are varied. From the sky docks of the city, that evokes a fantasy\/steampunk feeling, to the fleshy interior of the Bloom, there's a lot to like about the environments.<br><br>Sadly the character models don't fare as well. While they are not hideous, they do look dated, with a low polygon count, and relatively stiff poses. It's not something that really distracts from the game, but they could still have been done better. The humanoid models are also visually uninteresting, with little that really stands out about them. Where the game that inspired this had a large cast of very distinct looking characters, here they mostly look the same. Non-humanoid characters do fare better, and there are a couple of interesting looking creatures in this game, but once again, the quality of the character models do disappoint a bit.<br><br>There's not a whole lot to say about the sound in Torment. The music works as background music, and often feels directly inspired by that of Planescape, but after having played the game, there are no tracks that really stick out in my mind. The voice acting is overall not bad, but not spectacular either. Most of the dialogue is not voiced, but what is voiced does the job well enough.<br><br><b>Setting &amp; story<\/b><br>This is where Torment shines. The game is, as previously mentioned, set in the Numenera setting. The setting offers a mix between fantasy &amp; sci-fi, but in a more coherent and logical way than games like Wizardry or Might &amp; Magic. There are remains of ancient high-standing civilizations everywhere, with younger civilizations building on top of older. This means that during play, you run into both fantastical beasts, and robots, ancient constructs, and modern architecture. It's an interesting setting, one I wish to explore further after having played through the game. <br><br>In terms of story, you start the game falling from the sky. You're not sure why, who you are, or where you've landed. Unlike classic amnesia stories, there's a reason for this that makes perfect sense in setting. You're the creation of a god, or are you the god reborn in a new body? You're not sure, but as you move through the world you find out more about this god, about the struggle it faces, and about its conflict with its children. I'm not going to spoil it further, but it's a mostly well told story, although it ends up feeling rushed towards the end. The main story also ends up feeling a bit too linear, and once you've left an area, you can never go back. The way the progression is structured, the game world actually ends up feeling really small.<br><br>Like many other CRPGs of this type, there are also plenty of side quests to be done, many smaller stories that are being told around you, and that you can influence. There are no rats in the basement quests in this game, or go and deliver this box of cupcakes to that person, all the quests have their own stories, that are generally well written and interesting. There are also several different ways to solve most quests. You might talk your way through them, fight your way, use specific objects in the world, or a combination of the above. And they often have different outcomes that sometimes end up haunting you further into the game.<br><br>Each of your companions also have their own quests, and a large amount of dialogue, that lets you learn more about them. This is against quite well written, but I do feel that some companions are far more interesting than others. None of the ones I've used have been boring, but some could have used a bit more work. Still, if you're the kind of person who loves to get to know your party members, Torment has you covered. Sadly Planescape does trounce Torment: Tides of Numenera quite soundly when it comes to party members. There are more of them, and they are also more interesting.<br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>There's a lively debate surrounding this game's predecessor, about what counts as gameplay. Just the combat, or does the dialogue choices you make also count as gameplay? Depending on which side of the line you fall on, Torment either has very little gameplay, or still a fare amount of it. There are a lot of dialogue choices to be made in Torment, and they can have wide-ranging consequences. <br><br>One system that I really liked from Torment is the &quot;efforts&quot; system. When you're performing a task that requires a skillcheck, you've got a base chance based on your skills &amp; stats, and then you can spend &quot;efforts&quot; into improving your odds of success. These efforts are treated like a resource that replenishes  when you rest, and it's a really nice system, which allows you to be the judge of what skill checks you think it's important to succeed in. Efforts come in 3 categories, might, speed &amp; intelligence, and each character has its own pool of efforts to spend from these categories. I did find intelligence to be the far superior category to build my character around though, as there are more skill checks that requires intelligence than there are from the other categories.<br>As you level up you can also gain &quot;edge&quot; which gives you free efforts to spend in each skillcheck. So basically if you were to make an intelligence skill check and have 2 in edge for intelligence, you've already got 2 free efforts spent in each skill check  using intelligence. This is both a nice idea, allowing you to become noticeably better through the game, and almost gamebreaking, as you've got so much edge towards the late game that running out of efforts becomes a non-issue.<br><br>Combat is the game's weakest point. It uses a turnbased system that feels like something out of a pen &amp; paper RPG. The efforts\/edge system is in use here as well, and it works well enough, but sadly none of the combat encounters feel very well designed, and the slow animation speed makes them drag on for longer than they should. You're also never given enough options for it to feel really tactical.<br><br><b>Final thoughts<\/b><br>I'm a bit torn on Torment. On the one hand, the writing is great, the story is interesting, the setting hints at something amazing, I like the dialogue system and the effort system but on the other hand, the game feels too linear and towards the end rushed. The combat system also feels underdeveloped, though luckily you can easily avoid most combat. Despite numerous delays, the game still feels like it could have used some more time in development.<br><br>Do I recommend Torment? Yes, I do, if you enjoy dialogue heavy CRPGs, but it's not a glowing recommendation. The game has some very strong point, but also some weaker points that holds it back from greatness. But if you've already played Planescape: Torment &amp; Pillars of Eternity, and want to play another party-baed CRPG, Torment: Tides of Numenera is not a bad choice. Just don't expect it to be as good as Planescape: Torment.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30500699', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30500699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30500699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30500699' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30500699\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30500699', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30500699_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30500699_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30356890\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985945655\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"25679927\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/082c9c10b54d40126781558a7a6071f7b7526500.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/082c9c10b54d40126781558a7a6071f7b7526500.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/08\/082c9c10b54d40126781558a7a6071f7b7526500_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985945655\/\" data-miniprofile=\"25679927\">Drunk Crow AIDS<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985945655\/games\/?tab=all\">121 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985945655\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197985945655\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">51.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>TL;DR<\/b> <i>Tides of Numenera<\/i> is a good game; it only seems bad when you put <i>Torment:<\/i> in front of the title.<br><br>So - another game from the anointed messiahs of old-school CRPG development, and this one is supposedly the 'spiritual sequel' to the hallowed <i>Planescape: Torment<\/i>, no less!<br><br>On its own merits, <i>Numenera<\/i> is good game. I backed it on Kickstarter at the lowest level (which was about \u00a310-\u00a315 if I remember right), and for that price I got great value for money and lots of enjoyment. I think I would wait for a sale rather than pay the release price though.<br><br>The world is a weird and wonderful one, with lots of nooks and crannies to investigate, colourful characters to meet, and bizarre hightech powers and weapons to wield. Most of the inhabitants of the city of Sagus (where most of the game takes place) are ignorant of the technology behind all this, so all the fancypants electro-swords and brain-cooking zapper pistols are often seen as magic. The result is a pleasing steampunk scifi sort of vibe.<br><br>Combat is unfortunately a rather dull, clunky, turn-based affair - but thankfully as I broke from my usual habit of playing a tanky sword and shield guy and went for a silver-tongued brainiac nano (the game's wizardish class) I often found that fights could be ended early (or more often avoided completely) thanks to my gifts of the gab. This also made my psychic powers stronger so the occasional fight I did get into wasn't too hard with some help.<br><br>Companions are an amusing and varied mix of archetypes, if a bit shallow,<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>(apart from my little buddy Rhin :) )<\/span><\/span> with good flavour voice acting on a small amount of their and other NPCs' conversations, which add a little richness to what is otherwise large amounts of silent text. Lots of reading to do in this game which I enjoyed - descriptions and speech are well-written but brief enough so as not to interfere with moving things along. <br><br>Graphics are decent enough and quite pretty in places, although characters' faces do tend to look a bit like clothes mannequins.<br><br>Overall the story and setting were engrossing enough to have me playing enthusiastically until the credits rolled.<br><br><br><b> BUT WAIT - <\/b><br><br>This game isn't being judged entirely on its own merits. Instead of just being called <i>Tides of Numenera<\/i>, this game is called <i>Torment: Tides of Numenera<\/i>. And that's the main reason lots of nostalgic people like me funded this game (and a real can of worms).<br><br>What struck me most about the original was the main character - the Nameless One. Gravel voice, scars and tattoos, ghoulish looks. He begins as a fairly cliched amnesiac <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>, but as the story develops we find that he has lived many lives - soldier, scholar, mystic and many more. He has been a terrible villain, but later a hero. Worshipped and feared, hated and loved - he has commited terrible atrocities, manipulated and sacrificed loved ones and friends, but he has done great deeds of heroism, kindness, and selflessness.<\/span><\/span> <br><br>I get that in Numenera the Last Castoff is intentionally a blank slate so that the choices players make shapes his character, but what was so clever about Planescape was that the Nameless one could be a fully rounded prewritten character by the end of the game, whilst still being shaped by the player's choices. And these choices still made sense within the larger context of the Nameless' character <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>because they are drawn from aspects of all the various forgotten experiences he has had, as well as what the player has done. He could finally be redeemed, or be a villain far worse than the final boss, all because of the choices of the player.<\/span><\/span> The Castoff on the other hand, is a non-character. Voice acting has a generic hero sound, and he has no experiences because he was literally someone else just before the game begins.<br><br>The supporting cast of NPCs in Planescape was likewise so much more memorable than Numenera. Morte, Annah, Fall-from-Grace, Dak'kon, Ignus. That weird cube-man who had Homer Simpson's voice. The Lady of Pain, Deionarra, the Night Hag, the Silent King. That hive-mind of super-intelligent rats! I haven't played that game in years and I can still remember them all. I think the only character I will remember in any detail from Numenera is Rhin. Plus perhaps the Changing God only for his name, and the BigBad Sorrow <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>mostly because of a huge expositional dump of information at the end of the game.<\/span><\/span><br><br>Planescape had a grimy, grim, at times nightmarish atmosphere. Numenera approaches this later in the game <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>(the Bloom is the best area by far)<\/span><\/span>, but never manages to reach those heights before or after.<br><br>&quot;What can change the nature of a man?&quot; - the thought-provoking question and motif that appears throughout the game and is relevant to so many of its facets, and to its main character in so many ways. There is no simple answer to it.<br><br>Numenera's limp counterpart is &quot;What does one life matter?&quot; - the answer being &quot;it matters loads, because you are the Chosen One who must defeat the Big Bad.&quot;<br><br><i>Tides of Numenera<\/i> is a good game; it only seems bad when you put <i>Torment:<\/i> in front of the title.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30356890', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30356890' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30356890\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30356890' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30356890\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30356890', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30356890_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30356890_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t49 of 81 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30332262\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198115226378\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"154960650\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/afd0a1a271472a796555b5f1ae588c5e7a7b9670.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/afd0a1a271472a796555b5f1ae588c5e7a7b9670.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/af\/afd0a1a271472a796555b5f1ae588c5e7a7b9670_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198115226378\/\" data-miniprofile=\"154960650\">HappyEvilSlosh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198115226378\/games\/?tab=all\">65 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198115226378\/recommended\/\">19 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198115226378\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">103.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a tough one. tl;dr I *would* recommend the game, but it comes with a few caveats in particular: don't buy it at the present price. they're having a laugh.<br><br>The details.<br><br>The bad<br>1. As a backer I was *really* disappointed with the difference between what was proposed in the kickstarter campaign and what actually ended up in the final product. I tried to keep an open mind when playing but it still did leave a sour taste.<br>2. The companions are mostly... kinda uninspired. In PS:T you could choose 5 companions out of 7 and I always stuggled deciding who not to take in my party. Here you could choose 3 out of 6, so you think it would be harder, but I had no such trouble - especially since you can't have Aligern and Callistege in a party together so that rules out a bunch of party combinations.<br>3. The character models are kinda... bad. In particular I often found the Last Castoff's running annimation pretty goofy looking.<br>4. A lot of the character options seemed pretty cosmetic (backed up by some videos I've watched). Tides, foci, descriptors... just don't seem to have very much impact on how the game actually plays out.<br>5. The UI felt incomplete to the point where I tried to avoid using it.<br>6. It's simply not as good as PS:T although it's not a bad effort.<br>7. It felt like there was a real lack of item progression in the game, and the effects that the various damage types did were never very clear to me. I think I changed my gear like... twice.<br>8. The price, IMO it's well not worth what they are currently asking for it ($74.95NZD at the time of writing).<br><br>The good<br>----------<br>1. The Mark Morgan music is on point again. Like that guy is fantastic. <br>2. The world is well imagined, I loved following through asking about everything and seeing the backstory piece together during the game.<br>3. The companion Rhin is great, whoever wrote her (kidding I know it was Patrick Rothfuss) is a champion.<br>4. The level backgrounds were bautiful.<br>5. Did I say I really liked the Numenera setting? I hope they or other groups write games set using the system in the future.<br><br>Now I know there's more bad than good but I honestly felt the good passed the bad in terms of my overall enjoyment of the game. However if you haven't played Wasteland II or Pillars of Eternity definitely go and play those first because they are both better games. If they haven't satisfied your itch then I would definitely say give Tides of Numenera a go after those, and the price coming down a tad.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30332262', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30332262' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30332262\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30332262' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30332262\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30332262', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30332262_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30332262_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 73 people (59%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30482241\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"105817986\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9a\/9a76803a1bf5b150c923e4cae2ba49bc0db19d29.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9a\/9a76803a1bf5b150c923e4cae2ba49bc0db19d29.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9a\/9a76803a1bf5b150c923e4cae2ba49bc0db19d29_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105817986\">Bringer of the Apocalypse<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/games\/?tab=all\">1,503 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198066083714\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">65.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEDIT: After going through a second playthrough, I have some added thoughts. I stand by the original review and it have not changed it or removed anything, but have added some final thoughts.<br><br>Alright... Let's start with the negatives. There are a few. There are quite a few bugs, most of them minor annoyances (EDIT: See the end for how these minor annoyances became a lot more major.). But I have through one complete playthrough and well into the second one encountered two quest bugs that make it impossible to finish those quests. In the first case it was annoying, but didn't really ruin anything for me. The second one, however is a pretty big deal and almost causes me to turn on this game. I have decided not to continue with that playthrough until this is fixed. I should note that I had no problems at all with the same qeust on the first playthrough. This is not acceptable in a game that has had such a long ( and open) development time. There are minor technical issues here and there but I have not experienced anything bad.<br><br>With that out of the way - This in an incredible game when it comes to story, plot, characters, atmosphere, lore and worldbuilding. It is well worthy of its claim as successor to Planescape: Torment. The protagonist is slightly less interesting than in P:T but the progression and decisions make up for it. There is an army of characters and quests, mostly very well done and varied.<br><br>If you're not ready to read, and lots of, then this is NOT the game for you. The sheer amount of written dialogue and descriptions is staggering and very well done.<br><br>If you're expecting action then, again, this game is NOT for you. There are few combat situations and most potential combat situations can be avoided through conversations and skills. It's a plus in my eyes but some may disagree. As a matter of fact there is no actual combat situation - it's referred to as Crisis and can be resolved in many ways, including but not limited to combat. The combat system is turn based and old-school gamers will be very familiar with the good and bad of such. I like it but it can be on the tough side.<br><br>The character progression is fairly traditional and easy to learn but may not be for everyone. It's the ol' fashioned 'get a bunch of XP and level up' but with the added wrinkle that there are four levels \/ tier. You can only do so much every level but gain new abilities at every tier. The characters are pretty weak to begin with and get more versatile and powerful with time - no big surprises there.<br><br>Long story short, this is a very good game worth the wait (I kickstarted it back in 2013) but it sure as hell isn't for everyone. It's an incredible world and story with a lot of great content but it absolutely will not appeal to those seeking a fast pace and\/or action. This is a game that takes its time and rewards patience and immersion. That's my thing, may not be yours.<br><br>But is sure isn't perfect.<br><br>Finally (this will be a personal gripe, by all means stop reading if you're satisfied so far) I cannot, for the life of me, understand a looooooot of the other reviews for this game. I see an awful lot of complaints about the lack of action and combat and complaints about the amount of text. I don't mean to be rude, but it has been purdy clear from day one that this would never be a game drowning in action nor lacking in reading and lore. So I stress, again, if you're looking for action this just isn't the game for you.<br><br><br>EDIT: I went through and finished a second playthrough. Using some player knowledge of the quests, I managed to completely avoid any such bugs and could do (and finish) all the quests. I still think this is a very well written and thought out game, story, plot etc. I also still think it will never appeal to everyone, but then people forget that nobody bought Planescape: Torment on release and it took years for people to understand what a remarkable game that was. In my personal instance, I alone in my group of friends bought and\/or thought it was special. That's the good news.<br><br>There's just no way around it, this is a buggy mess. I've lost count of the number of issues I've experienced but they've ranged from tiny annoyances to game-breaking in a sense. I had to effectively restart a playthrough from scratch becuase of a quest bug. Late game I had to relaod the same encounter repeatedly because my character was knocked down for -1 round, which so completely baffled the program that I was stuck. I've had a situation almost at the end of the game where I was basically stuck because I was given a 110% chance at succeeding at a task. But the thing about bugs is that they can be fixed and I have a feeling inXile could have really used a few more months, but wouldn't have dared to delay once again. <br><br>The positives of the game, as far as I'm concerned, still far outweigh the negatives. But I repeat once more that this game will never appeal to everyone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

comparing numenera with planescape is simply stupid, they are two different games, but you can feel part of planescape in numenera, and that what devs promised us. so i dont get all this bad reviews based on comparison.<br><br>i have finished game and it was great, story is major part of this game and it is fantastic. i really enjoyed each quest in numenera. it has a lot of text walls, imagine something on you own, kind of interactive books you know. always enjoyed it in Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale etc. and even now. but if you want to playe rpg with fast action, it is not for you. as i said game has great story, the 9th world is phenomenal, locations are designed by people who understand what numenera is or planescape was and you can find that feeling everywhere. <br><br>about turn system. its not bad at all, it is quite nice, skills are well designed, i think that everything fit here. but what i want from this game and what i expected was a story. everything else is made well, they didnt break anything. sure that i wish devs didnt cut so many things from game, but if they made that for greater good of game, they made a good call. <br><br>remember it is not placescape, and if you free your mind from that idea, you will start enjoy this game as you will focus on game itself and what it has, not what is missing. <br><br>i would give 9\/10 for Tides of Numenera.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30381992',

I come from a background of 20+ years of playing many different kinds of RPGs and I am a huge D&amp;D fan as well. This game did an excellent job at its depth of story and lore, its playability, and its respect to the core of what this type of RPG is. <br><br>What drew me to T:ToN was an opportunity to visit and engage in a fascinating new world, full of excitement, adventure, and wonder. Torment: Tides of Numenara does have a lot of dialogue and reading text is a huge part of the game. So if you have ever enjoyed reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, than this game is right up your alley. <br><br>Combat isn't the forefront means of handling conflict in this game, so it can seem like it doesn't happen often enough. The combat system does provide something more fresh than the old D&amp;D controls as well, which could feel clunky and burdensome at times. I have put in around 12 hours (already good value) and I've only focused on my one character.<br><br>Needless to say, I am a huge supporter of this game. In terms of raw utility, this will provide me many hours of good fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30933857', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30933857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30933857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30933857' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30933857\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30933857', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30933857_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30933857_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30933707\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198068083284\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"107817556\">deltabluesman<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 33.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNearly perfect.

The writing is the standout feature - it's easily some of the most engaging and imaginative I've seen in a game. Most of your playtime will be spent reading. Plenty of choice with clear consequences. <br><br>Constructing\/defining your character (your character\u2019s CHARATER, not just your stats) is central to the game, which is unfortunately refreshing given the current state of roleplaying games. <br><br>Combat system is solid, but it's possible to avoid most fights if that's how you want to roleplay. <br><br>Your companions are interesting, and you will become invested in them if you give them the time. Although, I do think that each character could use one more quest to strengthen the investment. Experience is not gained by characters outside your party, so you are encouraged to choose three and stick with them.<br><br>Overall, if you are willing to invest in the game, like you would with a good novel, it offers a very rewarding experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30891427', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30891427' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30891427\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30891427' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30891427\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30891427', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30891427_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30891427_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30889809\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kirinyale\/recommended\/272270\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"75241515\">Kirinyale<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 113.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a game that wanted badly to be a Planescape: Torment successor, but never really came close enough to it in depth.

My expectations sank deeper and deeper through the last two years of development woes. <br>But even in the cut down state the game was released in (I weep for all the content that was left on the cutting floor) I was still wrong! I did replay through PS:T six months ago and just finished T:ToN  (Steam counts 76 hours). While T:ToN does not reach the heights of it\u00b4s sire imhO it does stand tall and proud among the 10 best RPG I did play in the last 30 years. For a better review I fully share Alec\u00b4s opinions in his Wot I Think on RPS<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2017\/02\/28\/torment-tides-of-numenera-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >https:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2017\/02\/28\/torment-tides-of-numenera-review\/<\/a><br><br>But there is an important thing to add here. This game sets a glorious monument to one of the best forgotten Rock songs ever. And for this alone it deserves a thump up.
