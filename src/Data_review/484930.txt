Let me explain this claim by focusing on some of the key gameplay elements.<br><br>You guide a cute but well-fortified bee through hazardous environments and shoot opposing insects, reptiles and even birds (!) while avoiding obstacles like rocks, branches or honeycombs. The foes look like their real-life counterparts - you'll encounter blow-flies, hornets, nymphs, praying mantises, frogs,  black widows, fishes or even birds ( check the pictures on the store page )<br><br>After I had booted up the game for the first time, it reminded me instantaneously of the AMIGA classic &quot;Apidya&quot; which is one of my all-time favourite, but &quot;Beekyr&quot; really outshines the original in every single aspect!<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u0yGziPjSxI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u0yGziPjSxI<\/a><br><br>The stages are quite short, but they'll keep you on the edge of your seat; every single level introduces a new environment or new enemy foes \/ formations to keep you entertained and challenged. Copy &amp; paste level design like we saw in the new iteration of &quot;Dariusburst&quot;? Hell no! &quot;Beekyr&quot; even alternates between horizontal and vertical gameplay and in these moments it turns into a next generation &quot;PopNTwinbee&quot; game.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X9vh3nTdMhw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X9vh3nTdMhw<\/a><br><br>What I loved the most are all the nice details throughout the campaign: you'll encounter a dark light section inside a hive and when it rains, it will have an impact on the flight behavior because the waterdrops on the surface of the bee wing will drag you down - so you have to act against this ongoing effect while dodging enemy fire! <br><br>Performancewise you'll encounter no problems and it'll run on any toaster! I'll tested it on my wife's PC that only has a dualcore and a AMD 6870 and this ancient machine maintained 60 FPS easily!<br><br>So, do yourself a favor and buy this well hidden gem!<br><br>Thanks for time!<br>Crypt!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28160438', 'summary' );

As the first reviewer said it has simalarityys from other games, which is very true.And another game it also plays and looks like in its subject matter is another cassic called Insector X which came out on the Sega Mega drive all those years ago, which is a good thing, as it was one of my favourite games on that console.<br><br>OK down to Beekyr Reloaded!<br>First I can't believe there's not more reviews for this as its a very well made and very polished game to.It looks very lovely to look at with its hand drawn art style graphics, which for me I did not encounter any bugs in the game, apart from the ones actually in the game! Excuse the pun guys!\ud83d\ude01.<br><br>This game makes a lovely change from space bullit hell shooters, and goes for a insect based ideal which is great!.<br>Everything as I said is well polished and no glitches in sight, but that's not to say other people may encounter the odd issues.If you have a half decent PC with a fairly good GPU you should have no problems.<br>The graphics as I said fit the game perfect and the music is amazing with catchy memorable tunes, which sound very much like prog Rock to me on certain stages.<br><br>It's not easy on arcade mode and takes some time to learn and get used to it, but at the same time it's very rewarding as well.So I would suggest to play it on easy mode to start with to get to know and get the feel of the game.<br><br>As for how to play the game, I found it best on a X Box 360 controller which is all set up ready to play the game.<br>Iam playing it on the D Pad part, but as for analog and keyboard or mouse Iam really not sure!.<br><br>As for the stages there's lots of combinations to play it, as it says in the discription of the game, plus more playable characters to unlock to, which I can't wait to discover.<br>This game has been out for a while on Google play store and its a awsome mobile game on mobile, but this improves on every level in content, control, sound and achievements to, which I have been told are on the way very soon.And one other thing the PC version has which the mobile version has not, is the bomb's you can collect and use, which charge up and fire at the enemy.<br>The bomb's take some getting used to and require a certain type of timing as they don't luanch straight away, but I guess they act as a timing thing and a skill to learn to.<br><br>Iam going to be blunt and say this game has production values far better than some \u00a310 games and even \u00a315  arcade shoot em up games to.And when you think it's just \u00a35.99 which I feel is a crazy price for what you are getting for that.<br><br>Last but not least! I really can not understand why this game has not got more interest in the Steam community and more reviews and downloads to, from what I can see<br>So far!.<br>So do yourself a favour and try it as you have nothing to loose.And if you don't like it then there's always the refund option to, but think alot of people would as long as you like old school shoot em ups with a modern look!<br><br>I could talk about this game all day! But do yourself a favour and give it a try guys! \ud83d\ude01\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29128107', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29128107' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29128107\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29128107' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29128107\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29128107', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29128107_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29128107_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/484930\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28160438","29128107"]}
