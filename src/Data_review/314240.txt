You own a kingdom. Why? Who knows. You build stuff (taverns, shops, barracks, etc.) in a large-ish grid of grass and trees. You attract people into your kingdom, in hopes of them buying some stuff from your shops, like your average tycoon, although as of yet it is a very small focus. The big focus is on quests. You send your heroes on certain types of quests (rescue, vanquish, deliver, etc.) in certain other kingdoms. You allot some points to certain categories, and they're on their way. Thats pretty much it. Build more, quest more. Thats kind of all it is now. Now on with the rating. First of all, if I could rate this game N\/A, I would. This game is simply unstable. There are many many bugs and imbalances. The developer himself said the game cost almost nothing to make, so I truly think the game would have been shed in a far better light if he waited to release it on early access. Although it is on the right track, its hard to recommend it as it is. Here is a pros and cons list, with that out of the way:<br><br>Cons:<br>Unbalanced<br>Buggy<br>Sensory-depriving color pallette, nothing but green and brown and gold highlights the whole game.<br>Somewhat repetative quests, with sliders that seem to do nothing (unlike the ever-important sliders in GDT) EDIT: Sliders are now gone, and are replaced with... nothing? Now its worse than before, but not stealing something anymore.<br>Slow progression, esp. in building.<br>Once money (sorry, 'gold') goes below 0, its game over. No exceptions or anything, just a game over screen.<br>Heros slowly die, with no apparent way to heal them. You even get a healing potion store, but not for them I guess. EDIT: This is aparently now fixed<br>Klunky UI<br>(keep in mind that almost all of these cons are things that can very easily be fixed by tweaking some numbers and code, so its up to the developer to make things right, for me atleast.)<br><br>Pros: <br>Interesting and unique graphics (though they could still use quite a bit of work)<br>Despite monotony, still quite fun. <br>Things to research,<br>Shops to run,<br>Not much else to say. <br><br>I recommend this game because it is absolutely on the right track. If everything goes as it is, this game will be good. I can't disrecommend this game because of unforseen bugs and unbalances. While the developer should have released it a bit later, he very well might not have gotten any playtesters, therefore not being able to find any of those bugs or unbalances. The core game is fun, and thats all I'm looking for. So overall, I'm cutting this game some slack. I'll probably only play it briefly after the large updates every few weeks or so. The developer very honestly says he will work as hard as he can to finish this game, but anything can happen to one lone developer. A caring, involved developer like this is what this game needs to be fixed. I just hope he will. As of now, the current update, wait to buy, but you eventually should.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13829760', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13829760' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13829760\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13829760' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13829760\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13829760', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13829760_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13829760_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22582810\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"90209721\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/43\/43a28e532affe2d2e143c3d79b2b29dae1bba338.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/43\/43a28e532affe2d2e143c3d79b2b29dae1bba338.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/43\/43a28e532affe2d2e143c3d79b2b29dae1bba338_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/\" data-miniprofile=\"90209721\">W.Henry<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/games\/?tab=all\">116 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/munkelschmunkel\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> RPG Tycoon - Review <\/div><br><b>Gameplay:<\/b><br>This game features two different aspects (RPG and Tycoon, duh), which are brought together in a rather interesting, but initially confusing way. Basically half of the game happens in text boxes.<br>You manage a kingdom, build it, take care of your people (your <i>followers<\/i>) and expand by meeting the needs of both your followers and your heroes.<br>Heroes bring in the aspect of RPG: You use the heroes to gain gold, experience, supplies and reputation all around, by sending them on quests. These quests do have direct effects on your kingdom, but in terms of gameplay are basically a few textboxes and a progress bar. It basically brings in another aspect of management, next to the management of income, followers and overall expansion.<br>The game was very confusing in the beginning, since you need to figure out how much you actually spend on working on your kingdom and how much you invest into your heroes and their quests. <br>There is a big repertory on buildings and quests, so one is faced with a lot of decisions.<br>The Tycoon part in general is filled with neat sprites, whilst the RPG part is pretty basic, yet it plays a big role in the development of your kingdom.<br><br>The game also features quite a lot of bugs, which, for a full-release title, certainly is a big down.<br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br>+The aspect of kingdom-management has been very well designed<br>+Long lasting gameplay<br>+Full workshop support<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>-The RPG aspect of the game is textbased and very basic<br>-Bugs<br><br><b>Conclusion:<\/b><br>The game seems to be in a strange harmony, with the graphic based kingdom management, and the text based quests, where you need to find the balance between these two aspects to be successful on your journey.<br>Since this game is already full-release I can not ignore the bugs and they therefore also will be part of the final score:<br><u>5\/10 - in its current state.<\/u><br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22582810', 'summary' );

Quests give experience, both toward the heros that youve sent out, and your kingdom, that goes toward new building types, kingdom expansion and player stats, that affect your dice roll during quests.<br><br>The gameplay is verymuch sandbox, but you can choose to undertake the general progression type quests, that give you money when youve completed a small list, which leads to another list, with more money.<br><br>You can also start a custom game, where you can choose how much starting money you have, experience amounts given, etc etc...<br><br>The devs are also happy to let people mod the game, and apparently its easily done... and, you can (if not a mod maker\/coding expert like myself,) you have to ability to write your own quest stories and layout (not that ive done so, but still.) ...I've checked therough the files saved on the compueter however, and i can see that, the config files are also quite easily changed... so theres that too.<br><br>EDIT: I have recently been in contact with a developer of this game, and they seemed very considerate and detailed within their responses. Good news.<br><br><br><br>....Yes, there have been issues with bugs, but upon realising that after uninstalling the game, files were left behind, so i deleted them after searching 'my computer' and then using Ccleaner to scan and delete old files and registry files3- i re installed and the game is prettymuch working perfectly, dont be offput by negative reviews... its a one \/two man team thatve been working on the game for a few years, and, through reading the replies from the devs toward bug reporting comments- the dev\/s understand there are issues, and havent made any poor comments toward constructive criticism.<br><br>be patient...it'll be worth it, im sure.<br><br><br><br>I've rebuilt and started over too many times... its my own fault, i cant help it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23605098', 'summary' );

I bought it yesterday and it's honestly shaped up to be a pretty good game.<br><br>Dont count this game out because of it's old reviews. I've had a blast playing it. <br><br>I'll try to update my review once this gets updated or upon full release but as for now I wanted to add a positive review to the list.<br><br>UPDATE 12\/2\/15<br>I havent tried this game again in a good while. So far I can tell the game has had alot of explanations for things added. Such as skills on your heroes. I didnt know what they really did before (or if they even did anything back then) but now you can mouse over things to see what they do. I also enjoy being able to make multiples of certain buildings. Like needing to build houses for each of your heroes, rather than just having one house that you cram all of your heroes into. IM SO GLAD I CAN BUILD MULTIPLES OF THE SAME BUILDIGN NOW! Now I can make massive marketplaces rather than only being able to have one weapon shop! This is something I wanted REALLY bad before.<br><br>This game keeps getting alot better as time goes on. Though I'm sad I lost my save from for freaking ever ago, there's alot of things that changed that I'd need to learn about by playing again. I'm a massive sucker for Town management games.

The game has come very far despite all it has been through. the new animations are good with clear tweaks to the quest system making it all better along with the idea of land that you have to purchase. where it is today, i feel like i could spend hours playing and making my kingdom the best it can be. I say give the game a chance and support if you like it, i love the game and can't wait to pour hours of my time into this game. good luck to the creator, you have my best !\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16106031', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16106031' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16106031\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16106031' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16106031\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16106031', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16106031_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16106031_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t51 of 86 people (59%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11552728\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010600112\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"50334384\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4f\/4fcdd242afe8b50d439f6d760a589182255c7dd2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4f\/4fcdd242afe8b50d439f6d760a589182255c7dd2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4f\/4fcdd242afe8b50d439f6d760a589182255c7dd2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010600112\/\" data-miniprofile=\"50334384\">GullofDoom<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010600112\/games\/?tab=all\">1,101 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010600112\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198010600112\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while RPG Tycoon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo here's my thoughts on this so far. <br><br>It's an absolutely great start , you get to plop down the basic buildings , learn to juggle upkeep costs with actually earning enough for your kingdom , upgrades , buildings stuff like that. The few downsides right now would be that the game tends to just freeze up every now and then , and there's nothing you can do about it. So if you're going to play this save alot and be prepared to be a bit patient as you'll only have 1 hero for a good while and he gets fatigued at times. And the other minor gripes I do have would be with the way you set the sliders for your heroes on a quest. Things like Rush , Guard , Conflict sure you get the basic ideas but it's still very much vague , however the game is in early access and I'm hoping they'll make things like that a bit more accessible to people so they actually know what they're setting their sliders to and how it affects your hero on a quest. <br><br>All in all , promising and excited to see more of it! And the price point is extremely fair too.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11552728', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11552728' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11552728\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11552728' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11552728\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11552728', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11552728_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11552728_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14650002\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Kica16\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"193741740\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2717406daef97c686a19dbf3a3314302f10c56.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2717406daef97c686a19dbf3a3314302f10c56.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0c\/0c2717406daef97c686a19dbf3a3314302f10c56_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Kica16\/\" data-miniprofile=\"193741740\">Choo Choo<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Kica16\/games\/?tab=all\">40 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Kica16\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Kica16\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">40.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while RPG Tycoon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am really enjoying this game, eventhough the development is slow.

Please find a way to tell people like me or tell me where I can look for updates.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14650002', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14650002' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14650002\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14650002' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14650002\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14650002', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14650002_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14650002_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13536774\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"45107094\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6f\/6f9afcce33b1e923022a0f2d5e35decff0c5b13d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6f\/6f9afcce33b1e923022a0f2d5e35decff0c5b13d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6f\/6f9afcce33b1e923022a0f2d5e35decff0c5b13d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/\" data-miniprofile=\"45107094\">Glasky<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/games\/?tab=all\">474 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Glasky\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while RPG Tycoon was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 22, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI understand the basics of this game and the fact that it is in ealy access. With that said, the current state it is in I would not reccomend it quite yet to those looking to play a game with some rough edges. This game has more rough edges than a un-cut gemstone. Personnaly I love the concept of this game, but no matter what I do, I lose before I can really get started. The learning curve of this game, I would say, is much higher than need be. The fact that you start with random quests, but the same towns is also a large cause for many of my losses as I've started with three quests none of the towns have cared for, thus ensuing I would not have enough gold income to survive. I also understand that roads need to be maintained, but dirt roads, (in real life can be made by a single person walking the same path over the course of time that all they need to do is keep walking it to keep it in decent shape) costs a fair amount of gold to maintain. That simple fact confuses  deeply. If there isn't another type of road yet in the game, fair enough, but if there is (which I can't get far enough in to find out myself) then there is no reason Dirt roads should cost anything more than being built. Another problem I have is the Item system. My meele hero can have either a sword OR a sheild? and are there no class speific items such as wands only useable by spell casters (I.e. wizzards, mages, ect.)?<br><br>In conclusion It's got a lot of rough edges, but I see that this game might just be a diamond in the rough at this stage. Reccomended for a easy to comprehend and play game for a good time? not yet. Reccomended for someone wanting to see a game as it developes and have fun learning the game and getting farther every update? Deffinatly recommened there.<br><br>As a Gamer I ask you to make this game easier to learn and have a better interface. <br>As a person who loves reffernces, I hope someday I can errect the tower of pimps in my city and have a hero that screws up alot of quests named Gavin the Commedian.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13536774', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13536774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13536774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13536774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13536774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13536774', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13536774_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13536774_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28098043\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"5978460\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbf8a1b5389d74aefc3e2c7f14b335a994c9a437_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/\" data-miniprofile=\"5978460\">Chris<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/games\/?tab=all\">1,712 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/\">88 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s taken me nearly 18 months to finally getting around to playing RPG Tycoon, during which time it\u2019s passed through Steam\u2019s Early Access, had its full release and most recently released its first DLC entitled \u2018Supply &amp; Demand\u2019.<br><br>RPG Tycoon is a city builder at heart played from the perspective of a Ruler who resides over a Kingdom. For their Kingdom to prosper it\u2019s the Ruler\u2019s job to make his settlement appealing and attractive for heroes to visit. Heroes they can hire to then send out on quests to earn gold, happiness and fame for the Ruler\u2019s Kingdom, so that in turn the Ruler can expand and improve their Kingdom.<br><br>Simple, right?<br><br>Well\u2026 no.<br><br>The game starts as a simple concept, which soon spirals into a deep interconnection between buildings, heroes, gold and happiness. Want a hero? Build a house for them. Now the heroes want paid. Send them out on quests, etc. But then the heroes want paid more as they level up from XP gained from quests, and such is the fame of your heroes that other adventures now visit your little kingdom and they want food, drink and entertainment. So, you find yourself having to build a Tavern, which makes an income from the visitors. Now your heroes are tired and low on health from manner quests, so you need to build a Medical Tent.<br><br>Somehow, you\u2019ve managed to get through the first year comfortably. Your Kingdom is happy, your heroes are doing well, your Tavern has levelled up. However, your town is looking shabby and the visitors aren\u2019t happy about the lack of decorations. They\u2019re also not happy about other \u2018things\u2019 and for me this is where the only real issue I have with the game starts to show \u2013 there\u2019s a distinct lack of visual feedback on what\u2019s making visitors and your settlements unhappy.<br><br>The lack of feedback makes it difficult to entirely understand how to improve your situation and stop your Kingdom going from being content and happy, to suddenly depressed. As far as I\u2019ve experienced so far unhappiness is the only end-state in the game. Perhaps there\u2019s a lack of money ending too, and perhaps your settlements get raided, but I\u2019ve never actually made it that far. Three to four years in-game time is as far as I\u2019ve managed before the sudden 0% happiness drop.<br><br>A brief check of reviews and Steam Discussion group shows you there are bugs still in this game, which isn\u2019t a crime by any means (even if some people have taken umbrage at DLC being released before old bugs have been fixed). The positive is that the game\u2019s developer, Matt Gambell is very active on both Steam and Twitter to answer and reply to feedback on the game. So, in an environment where indie devs are often criticised by some for hitting early access too soon for a quick cash grab, it\u2019s refreshing to be able to see an active developer who communicates with his player base and is keen to fix bugs.<br><br>In fact, during the time I\u2019ve taken to think and write about my experiences with RPG Tycoon, Matt Gambell has released an update that fixes an issue with Finance Happiness that was causing a drop in happiness rating. Yet, bugs remain, as shortly after starting a save game a few issues showed themselves including; rival kingdoms had reset &amp; a complete game freeze.<br><br>As you might expect from a title containing \u2018RPG\u2019 the game does have some basic RPG and tabletop elements to it. Heroes have attributes, which are used in quests (ranging from quick to epic) to gain fame and fortune. Yet the game lacks one essential element of any RPG or tabletop game and that\u2019s a basic set of rules and glossary for the user to follow and understand. That\u2019s not to see that the game doesn\u2019t provide information, as it does in the form of hero screens and quest descriptions. It just lacks the explanation of what those attributes do, and how they\u2019re used in quests. There\u2019s no real bridge between the game design and the user\u2019s experience. It\u2019s mainly left to chance, prior understanding and just a little bit of luck.<br><br>The little snippets of info and feedback that translate the developer\u2019s thinking and reasoning behind the game\u2019s mechanics into something the user can understanding (without giving the magic of the game away). At times I found the quest requirements unclear, and at times felt like I was guessing at what resources I should take on quests with me. Without a doubt I was guessing which slot they should go in to. On the plus side the game keeps a history of which combinations of items you\u2019ve used on quests, so it does provide a small amount of feedback to the trial and error approach it pushes you into.<br><br>I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a hope from the developer\u2019s point of view that the text quest provides enough information for the user to know what to take. A similar approach is used when you\u2019re offered a multiple choice situation during Epic Quests. There\u2019s no real feedback or insight provided other than the quest text. So when it comes to choosing an option, you\u2019re once again sort of just left guessing and hoping for the best. A roll check is then used to see if you meet the requirements, but the UI doesn\u2019t actually tell which attribute was used in the roll check.<br><br>So with all of that in mind I\u2019m left feeling that RPG Tycoon perhaps left Steam\u2019s Early Access a little too soon at the cost of detail and polish. The base of the game is there, it\u2019s just missing the smaller details to make the game more user friendly. You can enjoy the game\u2019s current state; it\u2019s presentation and soothing music, certainly make it a relaxing game to play and of course with a bit of time invested you will start to understand how to play. <br>It\u2019s certainly a nice idea, and one I hope gets the polish it deserves to make it more user friendly, as as far as I can see that\u2019s all it\u2019s really lacking.<br><br>A fun game, with an active developer that just needs that little bit extra to be fully enjoyable.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28098043', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28098043' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28098043\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28098043' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28098043\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28098043', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28098043_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28098043_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_container multiple_listing store\" id=\"ReviewDevResponsesummary28098043\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_exists_date\">A developer has responded on Dec 1, 2016 @ 3:11am<br><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mrluchador\/recommended\/314240\/#developer_response\">(view response)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: both;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30051566\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198081072891\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"120807163\">Cuccoruler<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 11.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is alot of fun!

The game has come a long way since its early days, with continued support, updates &amp; content added at a reasonable pace, with yet more work to be done &amp; bugs that may or may not pop up along the way, but also with a diligent &amp; friendly Dev that has stuck with it since the beginning &amp; continues to update, modify &amp; bug smash along the way &amp; is routinely responsive &amp; listens to his community.  <i>*End LSSV\/lazy\/ADD TLDR version.*<\/i><br><br><br><b><div class=\"bb_h1\">In-Depth analysis of the game &amp; the Developers performance to date:<\/div><\/b><br>The foundation the Dev has laid down for this game has always been solid &amp; the RPG, Simulation, Town-Building\/Management aspects incorporated into this game has always had lots of potential from its early days &amp; is mostly why Ive kept a good eye on it since then.  It looked promising enough back then but I was on the fence for several months, hesitant, mostly due to the critical reviews, while still checking back on it periodically.  <br><br>Eventually though, enough time went by &amp; after keeping an active interest &amp; a keen eye on it, &amp; seeing continued progress, development &amp; improvements &amp; watching his YouTube vids, I felt like this was a guy that was truly into his work &amp; committed to seeing it through.  So I finally decided to give in &amp; I bought the game..played it &amp; have had many hours of fun with it since then.<br><br>Since then &amp; along the way, many things have continued to be added, updated, improved upon &amp; expanded; some things becoming bugged, some things unbugged; all at a consistently reasonable rate; all of which is the standard norm for Early Access games with a small team.  Its just himself &amp; I think maybe he collaborates with 1 or 2 others.  Rinse, repeat; its an ongoing process, but one which the Dev has continued to see through on an acceptable basis.  <br><br>Aside from his normal To-Do list &amp; agenda of updating &amp; progressing the game over time in his own visions, hes also been receptive to the posts people have made with bugs\/suggestions, etc; as evidenced by the past posts from myself &amp; others here &amp; the change-logs &amp; resulting game-play changes that followed.<br><br>At one point, due to having a vested interest in this game; since its something very different &amp; so nicely encompasses so many cool &amp; different traits from other games &amp; genres that I really like &amp; since Ive always really hoped to see this game in completion someday; in my haste, I hadnt seen any Account activity or Discussion Forum posts from the Dev in about a month &amp; a half, so was worried that the Dev might have gone bye-bye as too many of them far too often do, with EA games these days...but he promptly &amp; politely responded, simply pointing out he always keeps a watchful eye, just not always from the Dev Account, which actually makes sense in hindsight.  <br><br>On that note, occasionally there will be the random\/rare person that posts bugs\/suggestions or w\/e &amp; then a week or 2 or more goes by without a response from the Dev &amp; that person becomes upset or says stuff like, &quot;Oh the Dev must not care&quot;. etc;  Which to be fair to them, up to a point, thats understandable.  I even jumped the gun myself once.  Its not unusual...&amp; in fact is sadly half expected anymore with EA games, for the Dev to bail on a game, or just not be at all involved with the community.  But I can personally &amp; honestly state, thats just not the case here, to this date.  He is just one guy &amp; has his own personal RL stuff going on, just like many of us do &amp; works on this game in his free time, which all things considered, seems like he must generally make a point to set most of it aside, to attend to this game.  <br><br>Also, he does personally respond to posts, just not every single one &amp; not all day, every day.  I personally can relate to that, as Ive got a super busy schedule myself, sometimes too busy &amp; have to prioritize the stuff I want to do VS the stuff I need to do, &amp; even stopping all that to do something simple, like respond to a text or email, can add more to my plate then I can already handle at that time.  I think a lot of Devs here on Steam fit into that category, as most of them arent full time programmers\/game-designers &amp; their game isnt their main source of income.  Some Devs dont bother to read &amp;\/or respond to their customers ever, but this Dev does fairly often.  And to me, as long as that level of customer service\/interaction continues &amp; the game keeps moving forward in a positive direction as its been; thats all that matters to me &amp; all I care about, to warrant supporting this or any Dev, that demonstrates that on-going level of commitment.<br><br><br><b><div class=\"bb_h1\">Bugs:<\/div><\/b><br>The last time Id put any time into this game was appx 2-3 months ago ( from time of this review @ Dec 17th 2016 ) &amp; had been wanting to play the game again after the last few updates\/bug fixes &amp; try out the new DLC.<br><br>So recently I was able to play several hours off &amp; on over the last week.  Started a new game, after buying the new DLC.  Everything was running smooth &amp; working great at first, with a few minor bugs like; every time saving &amp; quitting then reloading save game, the same few tutorial help boxes popped up, like if youre starting a new game.  Or while paused, clicking expand land, you hear the SFX of game like it was running even though visually, the game still appeared paused.  Nothing big or game breaking at all.<br><br>Some more problematic things started to occur later on tho, like upon saving &amp; reloading, most NPCs were unhappy &amp; leaving, with no indication there was a prob prior to saving &amp; quitting.  To be fair, Dev has a thread stating if you have probs be sure to erase that data which Im not sure I did this last replay. <u><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/314240\/discussions\/0\/35221584437504412\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/314240\/discussions\/0\/35221584437504412\/<\/a><\/u><br><br>Despite any bugs or probs along the way, I have faith in this Dev, from his past actions, not just words &amp; promises like some Devs can do.  My honest opinion is, if you like what you see advertised here from the games Vids &amp; Description, then you cant go wrong buying this game.  Its pretty much exactly\/mostly what youd want &amp; expect from a game like this.  Its not however a super duper in-depth game.  And its not meant to be &amp; doesnt have to be to still be fun &amp; enjoyable.  Nor is it on the shallow end either.  Overall its more of a mid-depth semi-casual gaming experience with several aspects that are still nicely in-depth, with other aspects to still keep you on your toes &amp; wanting to continue to play, manage, grow &amp; expand your kingdom.<br><br>Bottom line is, this games been in development for a while now &amp; continues to progress steadily, considering its from an Inde Dev.  Depending on the current state of the game &amp; where its at, you may experience a relatively bug-free game, or you may be in the middle of a recent content update with the inevitable bugs that follow, which TBH, yes can get frustrating.  But thinking about it... Why does one get frustrated with something in the first place, instead of just not even caring or thinking twice about it &amp; instead just walk away?  Cuz you care about it.  Cuz you like it.  Cuz theres some part of you that has a vested interest in that thing to begin with lol.  <br><br>Which is ultimately a testament &amp; compliment to RPG Tycoon &amp; what it does right &amp; why its worth most peoples time even now, &amp; especially once its 100% finished.  And which is why Im still glad I bought this game, even tho it has some polishing to do yet &amp; hopefully a few more features\/game-play additions.  I look forward to the future when well see this game in its fully realized, finished state.

Most games of the tycoon or city builder nature have multiple resources competing and impacting your progress, with selection of stats to grow being very impactful to your success.<br><br>In RPG Tycoon, the only really significant resource is money and everything else is tiertiary at best unless your aiming at unlocking specific achievements (which is what I've enjoyed doing!).  A single resource isn't necessarily a bad thing, however there's also only really one effective way to get that resource, and that is quests.  Within a single game, you'll come across the same quests multiple times, and while it's nice the first playthrough to see what the alternative choices would get you, it gets a bit grindy.<br><br>As your heroes grow, so does the amount of gold quests give.  This also keeps your settlements happy, so you don't need to choose between doing quests and having your heroes help around town since the answer is always do quests.  This results in the game getting a bit on the grindy side, but since I'm usually playing it while doing something else such as cooking or waiting for something to compile, it doesn't bother me as much as if I were trying to sit down and stay focused only on the game.<br><br>That said, I liked the game though it's very simplistic (nothing really matters but money, even though the &quot;Grow Your Kingdom&quot; tasks make you feel like you might have something to do other than run quests over and over again to grind out more money.  The only decisions you really make early on are avoiding going into severe debt early on because you don't know to grind quick quests and epics for cash yet.<br><br>The idea behind this game is great, but the execution still needs a bit more work and polish.<br><br>I'm hopeful the game will continue to improve with updates since it's been updated rather frequently recently, so I am currently recommending it!<br><br>EDIT:<br> I also agreed with the reviews about a number of bugs that break the game, but that said when I came across an issue, it was fixed within the next update after I posted a review about it, so I can't really complain too much there.<br><br>As a result, I'll be buying the expansion &amp; update my review later.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28398227', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28398227' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28398227\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28398227' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28398227\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28398227', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28398227_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28398227_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_container multiple_listing store\" id=\"ReviewDevResponserecent_short28398227\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_exists_date\">A developer has responded on Dec 17, 2016 @ 3:34am<br><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197992108067\/recommended\/314240\/#developer_response\">(view response)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: both;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26676931\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/CountGrishnackhh\/recommended\/314240\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"325751831\">CountGrishnackhh<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game reminds me so much of an old game called Lemonade tycoon, everyone remembers that old gem?
