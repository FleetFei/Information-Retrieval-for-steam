Trajectory revolves around the fact that your prison sentence is nearing its completion and you will have to complete various tasks to serve your sentence. <br><br>These tasks are varied in nature and range from normal things like repairing parts of corridor or something more exciting like making a jump to another spaceship. While the game does not have any sort of action sequences or anything of that sort, it gives players a very relaxing space environment to roam around in and uncover various secrets of the organization that has been keeping you in.<br><br> The game more or less stays on its path and the various jobs you do all lead to different endings. These endings feel quite different from one another and slowly let you uncover more of the game\u2019s lore, which in itself is pretty interesting to say the least. <br><br>While the tasks are many and you might not even see all of them during your playthrough, they do start to feel repetitive and i started to wish that the game gave me something else. You can roam around the prison quarters and in your own room where you are intended to sleep after the work has been done.<br><br> The space station is surprisingly quite small and it takes a short while to explore all of it. It is not helped by the fact that the said quarters look strikingly similar to each other and makes the environments feel a little drab. You might find secrets of the evil organisation Orbitek along your way but that is pretty much where the game stops.<br><br> The other mechanics like low gravity jumps are also not done well and leave a lot to be desired. Trajectory is not a game you will play for hours and hours on end as the experiences are similar to each other and aside from uncovering new endings, there is no real incentive to replay the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Visuals<\/div><br>Trajectory has a great visual aesthetic which shows in the environments created inside the space station. While the rooms get repetitive and some environments are drab featuring really low textures making them stand out in a bad way from the other well crafted places, it gives you a great feel of what it would be like to be stranded on a space prison knowing there is nothingness floating outside the room you are standing in.<br><br> But the game does falter in the use of its lens flare whenever you are looking out of a window. There is a blinding white light filling your eyes and might leave you stunned for a few moments. I might have preferred a more subtle use of showing the outside space through the windows than this overly enthusiastic greeting of the sun to my eyes.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div><br>Subtle sound system helps in building a solid environment for trajectory. There is a creepiness factor involved right from the start where every sound effect seems to echo throughout the entire station. The voice which reminds you of your tasks is monotonous and while that may sound bad on paper, it works perfectly given the overall nature of the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall<\/div><br>Trajectory is an unique game but not one which will be liked by many. It does not feature your traditional gameplay tropes and tries something different with its designs. And while not all of them work, Trajectory succeeds in pulling off some great environments and some surprising endings. It has a lot of issues at the time of writing but you can give it a try if you are craving something different. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Rating: 65\/100<\/div><br>This review was brought to you by <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/SilasReviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Silas Reviews<\/a>.

There are only a few days left of your sentence, and everything you do now has an effect on whether or not those few days are also the last ones of your life.<br><br>Some of the tasks, as instructed by the ominous voices in the intercom, consist of simple maintenance of your life in the space can. Every so often, though, you are required to undertake a special mission. These will have you perform a space jump over to an another spaceship, often abandoned for one reason or another. The special missions are the meat of the game, and there's a pleasing variety to them.<br><br>In fact, there are so many of these, you might not come across certain ones even after finding several of the endings. There's a lot more content than it might seem at first. The endings are also far and away from being a simple button press (I'm looking at you Deus Ex), as instead you'll find them branching out fairly well from each other.<br><br>As for the gameplay, at some points it can call for some patience as the game doesn't necessarily lay everything out for you in terms of what you're supposed to be doing. Being a first title of the developer in what's mostly a one-man show, perhaps AAA-grade game design is a bit much to ask, but I'd still hope for more hints. It helps to hit ESC when you're stumped, though, as the in-game menu always has some hints in the way of what you're supposed to be doing. While jumping to the other spaceship, I felt it wasn't clear enough that you were supposed to be aiming for the middle of the largest part of the ship, where there's a doorway for you to enter into the special missions. I'd also like the ability to use a flashlight, as I find myself reaching for one in a few dark spots.<br><br>The ending branches are great. These will send you to the most exciting locations in the game. The game even gives you a glimpse of what happened to Earth in this universe, and you might feel better about having had your warm prison module while visiting the home of humanity. Turning against the company you involuntarily work for is totally possible in several ways, and they won't hesitate to go after you at that point. Just keep your wits about you, and keep messing up Orbitek's plans is what I'll say.<br><br>Oh, and for a secret ending... Don't forget your pills.<br><br>-----<br><br>The reviewer has participated in the beta-testing phase of Trajectory.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30443846', 'summary' );
