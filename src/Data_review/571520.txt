Also, please see the developer's response to the previous version of this review in the comments as they explain that they plan to make improvements to the game.<br><br>Kalaban is an interesting game, which unfortunately suffers from the fact that the developers had to release it before it was complete according to their vision. It's still very enjoyable and playable, but you can tell some things could be improved (and according to the developper, they will be). It's not that it feels unfinished, it's just that the developers wanted to do more.<br><br>+ The atmosphere and the plot are great. Some games in this genre just stitch together random spooky things and hope that players will enjoy it, without really any concern for how it all comes together, and often it ends up like a collection of sad horror stereotypes. But this game's atmosphere seems to have been carefully designed, with an interesting plot.<br><br>- On the downside of this, the game lacks in storytelling. The character doesn't really make detailed observations about the environment or the events around him, so it's hard to really get immersed into this game. This is one of the things the developer said they plan to improve.<br><br>+ The combat is easy to pick up. It's simple and straightforward, there's nothing complicated to learn and no complex thinking required. Lots of games try to be original but end up being frustrating because the mechanics are hard to grasp. Kalaban gives you a standard combat mechanic, yet the fights can still be challenging.<br><br>+ The monsters are original. At least it's not zombies, for a change! I agree werewolves aren't exactly rare in video games either, but there are other unusual monsters in this game that set it apart.<br><br>+ You can use accessories like a flashlight and torches.<br><br>+ There's a lot to explore and investigate. <br><br>+ There's quests, and they're interesting and not repetitive.<br><br>+ The dialogues are well-written, every character you encounter sounds different in the way they speak. This is great, because too many indie games have NPCs who all sound like the same person talking.<br><br>- On the downside of this, characters don't always feel very realistic in the things they say or do. You'd just expect people to behave differently in a situation like this in real life. But that can probably be said of nearly all video games, and sometimes to have an interesting story you need to take some liberties.<br><br>- Despite the developer's response, I'm still not convinced by the food meter mechanic. Its only purpose is to regenerate your health over time (except on hard difficulty, where you lose health if you are hungry). There are already healing items, so I'm not sure why the game needs two different healing methods.<br><br>Was the purpose simply to add a survival element to the game? If so, I would say that a single survival mechanic isn't enough to make a game into a survival game. If I want a survival game, I need more survival mechanics than just a food meter. If I don't care to play a survival game, then I don't need a hunger mechanic at all so just give me additional medkits to heal myself instead. Hunger mechanics work in true survival games where managing your food and other supplies is important. But this is an action game, so this hunger mechanic only serves as a secondary healing system (and on higher difficulties, to make you race to finish the game before you run out of food). I just don't see what's interesting about that.<br><br>Also, having to wait for your health to regenerate isn't the most interesting thing to do. It just makes me watch as the health bar goes up before resuming my exploration. Again, I'd rather have more medkits instead.<br><br>Finally, the food meter goes down a bit too fast for my taste and it annoys me to constantly have to eat anytime I need to regenerate health. I'd rather find less food and have the food meter go down more slowly, so that I can focus on actually playing. Also it would make food consumption feel mor realistic, which would improve immersion. I must have eaten 1 week's worth of meals while the game takes place over the course of a single night!<br><br>Anyway, on to other things...<br><br>- The game is quite short. It's long enough for that price, but I would have loved it if it were longer.<br><br>- The ending left me unsatisfied. I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but the main objective is to escape the town. There's a secondary objective, which seems to be optional, which is to uncover the cause behind the mutant outbreak. The ending I got for escaping didn't make a lot of sense to me (didn't feel logical), plus some plot elements remained unexplained as if the game had suddenly forgotten about them. As for investigating the causes of the mutant outbreak, I'll just say that I found answers, but when this part of the plot was completed it was barely acknowledged in game. It was kind of &quot;Oh, seems I figured out why these mutants have appeared. Whatever&quot;.<br><br>Overall, I'm getting the feeling that the developer ran out of time to work on the endings properly, and hopefully this is something they will improve as well.<br><br>- While looting the environment, some visual feedback would be nice. Like containers having an open animation when you search them, or at least an inventory window opening up to show you the contents of what you are searching. Right now the world feels too static. Thankfully this is another things the developer mentioned they want to improve.<br><br>- Finally, there are quite a few bugs. None of them prevented me from enjoying the game, I did have to reload the last checkpoint a few times due to getting stuck or crashing, but you never lose much progress if you do this. Bugs are being worked on quickly anyway, so this should soon no longer be a problem.<br><br>Overall it's a very good game despite some minor flaws. It has an interesting plot and a creepy atmosphere, you can tell the developers had a good vision that they really wanted to put into a game. The gameplay is also enjoyable. The endings need work though because they're a bit of a disappointment right now, and it's too bad the game isn't longer. But overall it's a good experience and I recommend it. I also hope for a sequel that explores more of the plot related to he mutant outbreak.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28894496', 'summary' );

It's cheap and these are the kind of game devs that deserve the support.<br><br>I'll update this review after they release enough bug fixes for me to keep playing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28856404', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28856404' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28856404\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28856404' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28856404\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28856404', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28856404_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28856404_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29089520\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/abhigyan\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"170391369\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/9828c829c92df3c895dd89c215ea7f3458b165e6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/9828c829c92df3c895dd89c215ea7f3458b165e6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/98\/9828c829c92df3c895dd89c215ea7f3458b165e6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/abhigyan\/\" data-miniprofile=\"170391369\">Silas Abhi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/abhigyan\/games\/?tab=all\">1,538 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/abhigyan\/recommended\/\">123 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/abhigyan\/recommended\/571520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Kalaban for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Kalaban<\/div><br>Kalaban is a horror adventure game which focuses on the main character trying to escape a town where things have gone awfully wrong. Does it manage to creep out the player or becomes another snoozefest, let\u2019s find out:<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay:<\/div><br>Kalaban starts with the character waking up in an old house to see a werewolf standing on his dresser. He grabs his axe which was just beside his bed to kill down the beast with one swing. Kalaban manages to set up a creepy atmosphere from the get go. The unknown danger that awaits once you step outside the house is terrifying. Despite managing to setup a creepy atmosphere, Kalaban is let down by a number of issues. The combat presented here is very simple, you hack and slash your way through the enemies like a madman.<br><br> Even though the difficult rises somewhat towards the end, the game is way too easy on normal settings. Kalaban also suffers from a case of awkward movement and bad lighting. The lighting is so dim that a couple of times I had difficulty finding the door which was two steps in front of me. The same lighting is also responsible for a very genuine level of creepiness. Even the outside areas are dimly lit which casts a huge shadow over the whole town.<br><br> The plot while interesting in start devolves into something very generic later on where you have a main objective of escaping the town. It is not helped by the fact that the NPC\u2019s are one dimensional characters who are just plain boring.<br><br> Kalaban also tries to have some survival RPG elements which fall flat. There is a food meter in place which is supposed to regenerate health. It decreases with every passing second and forces you to scrounge up food wherever you can. The placement of this food meter which is a essentially a second health bar which decreases every moment is completely useless. The game also has some performance hiccups and lagged around a couple of times throughout my playthrough. It also tends to crash quite some times.<br><br><br>You can also find some loot in various areas which lets you upgrade your armour and weapons. The enemy variety is diverse and somewhat different from what is found in many other titles right now. The environments created in Kalaban are genuinely creepy and downright terrifying at times. The characters never fail to remind you that the place you are in looks creepy and that makes it quite annoying.<br><br> The gameplay is somewhat enjoyable even though it is the same basic hack n slash. The game is also short in length lasting around 2-3 hours. As usual your mileage may vary on the game length depending on how you play it but there isn\u2019t much to collect around or to replay for. Kalaban does the same job as another game called Dark Fear. It instils fear just by text and environments and never lets go in that regard but is let down by the many issues which are plaguing the title right now. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Visuals<\/div><br>I have mixed feelings about the visuals in Kalaban. On one hand, it is amazing how it manages to instil fear and convey messages through its environments and on the other hand, it suffers from a certain lack of polish. While the dimly lit areas manage to provide a scare element, they also a cause of major frustration at times. The enemy design is very generic and provides nothing new to look at. Overall, it has its hiccups but the environments created in Kalaban are stellar to say the least.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div><br>The soundtrack of Kalaban is perfect for what it is. Subtle music that lends very well to the creepy atmosphere created by the game and solidifies the environment. It gets you really immersed in the title makes your legs go weak at certain points. There were a couple of audio bugs and hitches during my playthrough but nothing that would break my immersion. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall<\/div><br>Kalaban suffers from a lack of polish. The environment created by Kalaban is amazing and manages to scare you but it feels way too lacklustre out of those areas. The combat is simple, enemies are weak and NPC\u2019s are boring. Kalaban has its visuals and some brilliant sound design but is let down by a weak plot and a number of performance issues. If you want something unique in terms of world building and creepy environments, Kalaban might be suitable for you. But someone looking for deep gameplay will be very disappointed.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Rating: 58\/100<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29089520', 'summary' );

Overall, I enjoyed it, but I would not recommend it for everyone.<br><br>The story mode is pretty short with ten different areas that are well designed.  I wish there were either more sub maps (that is, buildings or just unique locations or events) or more areas in the game.  Maybe Bethesda has spoiled me here, but I think this game could use more.<br><br>I was actually surprised by a few moments in the story and for that I would recommend this game even though it has an unfinished feel to it.   I really don't want to describe those moments as it may spoil it for some.  There are, however, certain &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; type events in the game which can possibly lead to immediate death which in a way feel out of place.<br><br>Combat is pretty basic.  At first you start with an axe (a good lumberjack would have spare chains...) and this can either give the game a survival horror feel, or make the player incredibly bored.  Essentially you will be running backwards trying to time your swings just right to hit charging enemeies.  I don't have any problems with it, but I can definitely see others not liking it.  From there you slowly collect other ammunition types and then build up your arsenal: pistol, shotgun, submachinegun,  revolver, and even a flamethrower.  Combat will present the player with two choices for healing: use an item to immediately heal or eat food to slowly regenerate.  If you take your time you can save your instant healing items for hard spots (and there are a few).<br><br>There are only a few different enemies, but they all fill a certain combat niche: a couple are ranged, one is melee, and one does area damage.  More enemies would always be nice, of course,  but I never felt like there needed to be more.<br><br>Dying is not really a problem, as the player can just relaod the &quot;scene&quot;, or area map.  I'm glad this isn't yet another permadeath game, as it doesn't need that element.  Maybe some people would want this choice, but I don't miss it in this game, especially since there is already a horde mode.<br><br>The horde mode is  a nice addition.  The story mode itself does not have a lot of replay value, but I did go through that a couple times.  In horde mode you just run around a couple of the area maps from the story mode trying to survive as long as possible against enemies that keep spawning in.  It's a good idea to add replay value to the game, but it's not exactly Crimsonland.  There just seems to be something lacking, but it's hard to describe why.  Besides the obvious, the way the two modes play are different.  You won't be accessing your inventory in horde mode, you just try to pick up what you need when you need it, if the enemy is kind enough to drop it.  It can be a nice frantic pace, but sometimes the enemy pathfinding is bad and there can be a lull in what should be a frantic mode.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed the game, and I'm glad to see there will be more updates.  This was a good effort and I hope to see more from those involved.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29155176', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29155176' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29155176\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29155176' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29155176\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29155176', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29155176_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29155176_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28810301\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Neptunesnookgames\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"84177214\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d2da48324eec778365ed4819185350b17f32935.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d2da48324eec778365ed4819185350b17f32935.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2d\/2d2da48324eec778365ed4819185350b17f32935_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Neptunesnookgames\/\" data-miniprofile=\"84177214\">Nook<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Neptunesnookgames\/games\/?tab=all\">223 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Neptunesnookgames\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Neptunesnookgames\/recommended\/571520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Kalaban for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKalaban is a mystery\/horror adventure game with a bit of RPG hack 'n slash thrown in.
