See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.<br><br>Your Ship:<br>Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.<br><br>Your Crew:<br>Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station\/planet offers different crews with different skills.<br><br>Gameplay:<br>Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple &quot;go there and shoot..&quot; missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command &quot;Fire at will&quot; which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).<br><br>Trade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.<br><br>Development:<br>Patches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.<br><br>Current Verdict July 18 2014:<br>Highly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.<br><br>*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)<br><br>Current Verdict September 16 2014:<br>Latest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign\/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).<br><br>So still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9927365', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9927365' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9927365\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9927365' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9927365\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9927365', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9927365_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9927365_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t339 of 370 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>69 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18886676\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"35219459\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa93bff5e2e11b8f236601d3b9682d4976f33901.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa93bff5e2e11b8f236601d3b9682d4976f33901.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aa93bff5e2e11b8f236601d3b9682d4976f33901_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/\" data-miniprofile=\"35219459\">lecoto<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/games\/?tab=all\">61 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995485187\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">146.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 4, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain\/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story\/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining\/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.<br><br>Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?<br><br>It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.<br><br>Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space?

It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.<br><br>I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him. <br><br>So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.<br><br>You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?<br>Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.<br><br>Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane &quot;Let's Moon'm&quot; cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.<br><br>You are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.<br><br>What is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.<br><br>In my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.<br><br>TL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12260123', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12260123' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12260123\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12260123' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12260123\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12260123', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12260123_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12260123_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t246 of 266 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">13 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9949805\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48906640\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c686a051c139ed9262126643e526ea6f02d38820.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c686a051c139ed9262126643e526ea6f02d38820.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c6\/c686a051c139ed9262126643e526ea6f02d38820_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48906640\">Sarogus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/games\/?tab=all\">278 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009172368\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Starpoint Gemini 2 was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 27, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim\/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!! <br><br>Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome. <br><br>Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.<br><br>Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields. <br><br>You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you. <br>Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight. <br><br>Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.<br>This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9949805', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9949805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9949805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9949805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9949805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9949805', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9949805_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9949805_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t260 of 289 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">25 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary7691938\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"91992755\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/cce143254f7092872d6b3f75e610d3c66a3a34c0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/\" data-miniprofile=\"91992755\">FastJack<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/games\/?tab=all\">651 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jax43\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">85.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 18, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t======================================<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Starpoint Gemini 2\t<\/div>(Updated review!)<br>======================================<br>**Don't Forget to Nominate this Game for the Steam Awards!**<br><br>LGM Games\u2019 successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.<br><br>On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...<br><br>======================================<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros\t<\/div>+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!<br>+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.<br>+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.<br>+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!<br>+Combat in big ships with fleets...<br>+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...<br>+Very well done Faction system<br>+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities<br>+Developer support that sets a new standard<br>+Best Community on Steam<br>+Awesome Replay value!<br>+Free content updates<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>None really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Neutral<\/div>+\/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)<br><br>======================================<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div><br>Starpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...<br><br>======================================<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Game-play<\/div><br>I have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.<br><br>I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don\u2019t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)<br><br>When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...<br><br>Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.<br><br>This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.<br><br>I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you\u2019ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>======================================<br>======================================<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div><br>Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals.

Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.<br><br>However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!<br>----------<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> LONGER REVIEW: <\/div><br><br><b> The good: <\/b><br><br>Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it. <br><br>The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun.<br><br><b> The not-so-good: <\/b><br><br>The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay. <br><br>Side-story missions boil down to &quot;repair structure there for $$$ and XP&quot; or &quot;kill enemies here for $$$ and XP&quot; or &quot;ferry person over there for $$$ and XP&quot; with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.  <br><br>During the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged. <br><br>Certain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude\/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet\/station where you can sell them.<br><br>Character progression is RPG-like, yet character skills\/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot.<br><br> For me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture\/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship. <br><br><br><br>------<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Long segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game: <\/div><br><b> Multiple plotlines in the game. <\/b> <br><br>The &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.<br><br>Examples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates. <br><br>I didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.<br><br>I think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of.<br><br><b> Being able to hail and talk to other ships and planets. <\/b><br><br>You don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion.<br><br><b> The ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text. <\/b> <br><br>Though it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station\/planet\/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts\/descriptions to great effect.<br><br>Why is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat! <br><br>Planets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click &quot;info&quot; and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land\/dock on every planet\/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.). <br><br>Overall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive. <br><br>Also, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12812308', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12812308' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12812308\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12812308' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12812308\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12812308', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12812308_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12812308_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t187 of 204 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>9 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18519627\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"49652953\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/1331d827124af414ee0481dad49ec22a5a7505e6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/1331d827124af414ee0481dad49ec22a5a7505e6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/1331d827124af414ee0481dad49ec22a5a7505e6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/\" data-miniprofile=\"49652953\">supersixty | vox<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/games\/?tab=all\">237 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sVoxxx\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">52.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC\/Privateer\/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.<br><br>PROS:<br><br>++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.<br><br>++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.<br><br>++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...<br><br>++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.<br><br>++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.<br><br>++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!<br><br>CONS:<br><br>++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad \u2665\u2665\u2665 with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is. <br><br>++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.<br><br>++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.<br><br>++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you. <br><br>I give this game an honest 10\/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target\/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an &quot;easy button&quot; but for me it really makes the game.

Even then, I rarely ever use them.<br><br>Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.<br><br>Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.<br><br>The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.<br><br>Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.<br><br>Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.<br><br>Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.

Bonuses are not being counted.<br><br>Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.<br><br>Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.<br><br>Show radiation areas on the map.<br><br>Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.<br><br>Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.<br><br>Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.<br><br>Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.<br><br>Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.<br><br>Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.<br><br>Fix the pathfinding.<br><br>Improve AI for wanted bounties.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12990617', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12990617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12990617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12990617' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12990617\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12990617', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12990617_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12990617_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30321910\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Grimtongues\/recommended\/236150\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"139349135\">Grimtongues<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm enjoying the game quite a bit because the graphics and core gameplay are enjoyable.  There's also a relaxed atmosphere to the game - I don't feel pressured into &quot;grinding in order to get to the good part&quot;.  The story is decent and there's plenty of &quot;flavor text&quot;,  galactic &quot;news&quot;, and loads of other ships flying around that altogether make the game world feel alive.  The GUI is well-designed and easily accessable with the mouse - I don't even bother using the hotkeys 90% of the time.  This also means that learning to play the game does not require memorizing a bunch of hotkeys!<br><br>The random mission system is better than average compared to other games in this genre.  Also, progression happens at whatever pace you choose - you can sit near a station and shoot asteroids in relative safety for small rewards, or you can do the level-adjusted missions for a modest reward at minimal risk, or you can rush straight to the hostile sectors and do missions 30 levels higher than your own.  Or you can skip the missions entirely and capture ships, selling them for massive profits if you have the skill to pull it off.<br><br>On the negative side, the game's ambient music lacks variety, so it gets annoying quickly.  Also, the ship's computer sometimes repeats warnings more frequently than necessary, which is especially annoying if the shields repeatedly drop due to EMP effects.

There are some issues that I have with it that are just hallmarks of past space sims. So if you hate typical downsides of space sims, then this game doesn't really break that barrier. If you're not a fan of classic space sims, then this game doesn't deliver much outside of that. But first off, I got this game when it was 80% off 2 years after it released. I got it primarily to scratch that never-ending itch of playing a worthwile space sim while waiting for Star Citizen to be a more complete game. My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.<br><br>The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.<br><br>You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting\/protecting\/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.<br><br>The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with &quot;bad&quot; factions, stay lawful\/chaotic neutral, or side with &quot;good&quot; factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.<br><br>You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine\/salvage\/scan\/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If\/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.<br><br>One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.<br><br>I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29964818', 'recent_short' );
