There's an achievement for spending 10 hours in the game, I know a few people cheat (hex ed) to get it (I dont care, each to their own) - but I truely was having so much fun I spent just over 10 hours in the game (I hexed it to get the 4hr cheev). <br><br>This made me feel like an interplanetary explorer. <br>The story reminded me of awesome 50's, 60's, and 70's classic sci-fi novels; especially Bradburys <i>The City<\/i> and <i>The Long Rain.<\/i> <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>And the monoliths\/power sources toward the end<\/span><\/span> lent it a superb feeling of.... I don't even know... mindblownness, a la Clarkes <i>2001:A Space Odyssey<\/i>.<br><br>The soundtrack gave the entire game an incredible feeling of desolation, bewilderment, and heightened the ups and downs of hopeful expectation. The soundtrack (and incidentals) was beautiful, a hecking blessing for the game.<br><br><b>The technicalities of gameplay<\/b> - it all worked. No glitches, no bugs, no issues except my dumbass poorly timing really easy jumps. Framerate dropped occasionaly making it a bit stuttery. Lowering the graphics settings and then turning them back up fixed the framerate issue. The controls are easy, wsad\/space\/m\/q\/e\/rmb<br><br>Some people have said Lifeless Planet is like an empty sandbox walking sim - well, yes it is. Thats the point. It's literally called Lifeless Planet because it's about a guy on a ... <i>wait for it<\/i>... <i>drum roll please<\/i>... <b>Lifeless Planet<\/b>. Theres actually a really good story happening on that planet and a pretty resilient little guy to take you through it. Honestly, I barely cared about the story, just walking around that planet was awesome. You can see places far off in the distance and you just know, 'Stick to the path. You've got to find a way home. You go wandering, you're going to die'.<br><br>The thought that my oxygen could run out was always in the back of my mind but never stressful. It was never (or rarely) a reason to rush. Other games give you survival elements like that and you just have to rush through stuff so you don't die, and you're forced to miss scenery or pick-ups. There's no rushing here. There's a sense of urgency but it instilled (in me at least) a sense of <i>'let's get this done properly, not quickly'<\/i>.<br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote with_author\"><div class=\"bb_quoteauthor\">#Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author<\/div>it's no AAA title however it has bags of atmosphere, exploration and that feeling you rarely get in games - a sense of wonder and imagination with a superb musical score by Rich Douglas.

It had a successful Kickstarter and passed through Greenlight to go to Early Access and to be released as completed game.<br><br>Its made by Stage 2 Studios which consists mainly of David Board, and the game is the outcome of years of passionate hard work, while it utilized all the stages an Indie project can pass through, till its released on Steam.<br><br>This game is a unique work of art that inspires and entertains with its beautiful visuals and its story, unlike anything you can find in big budget titles. Words hardly can express the accomplishments this game reached. Its a Sci-Fi Story Adventure comparable to the books of Isaac Asimov or Games like The Dig.<br><br>The atmosphere is carrying this game. It makes you feel lost, helpless and afraid, even sad and isolated, but then again it evokes curiosity, hope and amazement. It has very little action but a lot of exploring and platforming and a bit of quite easy puzzling. Its pretty linear, but that's to be expected from a game that tries to tell a story I guess. There could be a bit more to do in some parts of the game. <br><br>I will not reveal anything of the story, its yours to discover for yourself, because that's what the game is about. But I can assure you that it is very much worth it, if you have an open mind and search for something meaningful that you can enjoy without feeling pressured. It will take you around 5 hours for a playthrough. This is not a game for the impatient or simpleminded tough, those players will get bored or fail to grasp the storyline.<br><br>If there's one thought that I had while playing it, it was that the more you think you know about the world and the universe, the more you discover what you actually don\u2019t know. The Storyline and ending is partly open to interpretation. Its not very strictly explained, which gives room for your own imagination. A freedom very few games ever trust the player with, and therefore it has to be complimented on such bravery.<br><br>The technical aspects of the game are robust for such a small team, reasonable performance, hardly any bugs, no crashes for me. I had to restart a level because something to advance the story didn't trigger first time, but that wasn't really a problem. Controls where fine for me with KB &amp; Mouse, jumping around with the jetpack is a lot of fun. Gamepads are supported.<br><br>The graphical style is fitting for the game, although the way its done, also means that its looking pretty simple at times. Its definitely not a Crysis, but the aesthetics and level design make up a lot for it and make the game nonetheless a pleasure to explore and screenshot. It also has nice particle effects like dust, and the levels have a great variety of environments.<br><br>The musical score and sound is very good also, it really works well in combination with the storyline to emphasize important moments and add tension to the game. The voice acting is great, there are native Russian speakers who did the voiceovers and this makes this aspect really shine.<br><br>In conclusion I can say this game is well worth its price. The game has to be played and developers like these have to be supported. Buy and play this game, so we hopefully see more of this studio!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11542564', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11542564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11542564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11542564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11542564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11542564', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11542564_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11542564_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t386 of 512 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/recommended\/261530\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">27 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9361679\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"20611041\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b4ff724810e9025bf61139b087e37cfb052ab0b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b4ff724810e9025bf61139b087e37cfb052ab0b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b4ff724810e9025bf61139b087e37cfb052ab0b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/\" data-miniprofile=\"20611041\">\u00b0infinitus\u00b0 \u221e<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/games\/?tab=all\">369 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nimby1\/recommended\/261530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 6, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&gt;&gt; can somebody tell me why I can't make paragraphs(?) for every point (pro\/con)&lt;&lt;<br><br><br>EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:<br><br>___________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Wow! The atmosphere in this game is simply amazing. I have to say this is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.<br><br>You feel pretty helpless all by yourself on this vast abandoned planet as you slowly uncover the story of this planet and it's inhabitants.<br><br>The music and voice acting is really good, nothing to complain here! <br><br>There are still some things annoying me. For example:<br><br>I've got some FPS-drops sometimes and i run a GTX 680 and a i5 3570k + 12gb RAM... But the FPS drops won't make it unplayable but still it's a little bit annoying.<br><br>All in all this game is worth it's money (12.99\u20ac for me [that was early access now it's 19.99\u20ac). <br>I don't know how long it will take until you'll finish the game but for now it looks like you will spend a couple of hours with the game :)<br><br>(Now I know :D it took me around 5 hours I think)<br><br>___________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br><br>EDIT AFTER FINISHING THE WHOLE GAME:<br>___________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>After finishing the game my opinion about this game did not change :)<br><br>I will add some pro's and con's about this game:<br><br>PRO:<br><br>- breathtaking atmosphere (in my opinion)<br><br>- really interesting story which makes you wanna play more and more :) <br> (finished the game in one day because i couldn't stop playing)<br><br>- easy controls (it's a simple jump n' run)<br><br>- pretty graphics (not the best but they're okay)<br><br>- many different terrains\/locations (desert\/ice\/vulcanic\/etc...)<br><br>- AWESOME music, this is a huge plus<br><br>- good voice acting<br><br>- huge areas which have a beautiful view<br><br><br>CON:  <br><br>- the gameplay itself can be a little bit boring, the puzzles aren't that hard and the rest is<br>  simple jump n' run gameplay<br><br>- it's rather short (finished it in one day in ~5h)<br><br>- the graphics are okay but some textures are really &quot;wishy-washy&quot; :)<br><br>- a few times i did not know what i need to do, so i needed to check out some youtube videos<br>  (but that could also be my own stupidity)<br><br>- not very good optimized i had some fps drops while playing (~15FPS) even though i have<br>  pretty good specs<br><br><br><br>But still I can recommend this game A LOT. Especially because of the awesome music, the great atmosphere and the really thrilling story which won't let you stop playing the game :)\t\t\t\t\t<div

puzzle-exploration game.<br><br>An astronaut crew crash-lands on a distant planet, you awake alone and try to find your crew and quickly start realizing, that this planet isn't what you thought it would be.<br>Promised to contain life or at least good living conditions, you find yourself in a desert-like wasteland and soon discover, that you weren't the first to be on this planet.<br><br>The game is mostly about exploring the different locations, some platform jumping, solving some rather easy puzzles and collect log-entries, which will unveil the story to you.<br><br>The mysterious atmosphere of the planet is pretty well done and the story itself is presented in a way, which kept me interested and wanting to know what was going on.<br><br>Be aware that the game itself is rather slow and pretty linear, although the areas are sometimes quite big (but mostly empty).<br>The last third of the game feels a bit stretched and although you had some highlights, it could have been a bit shorter at the end, which would also be another point to watch out for: the game itself is rather short. <br><br>If you like slower paced exploration games, mysterious sci-fi\/fantasy stories then this might be a nice little game for you.<br>Personally i would wait for a sale to buy.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

You play as an American astronaut that is sent to explore a planet that your readings suggest is brimming with life. Upon arrival you find that this planet is nothing like you expected. It houses strange secrets of past explorers and a nation trying to find the perfect life away from Earth only to find that meddling with things they don't understand almost never ends happily. An interesting mix of casual exploration and platforming, it keeps things relatively fresh most of the time. You should feel the want to get to the end to see how everything pans out and what the mysteries of this Lifeless Planet are, but at the same time your feeling of eerie isolation and the ambient sounds of the world make you want to take your time looking at the planet and chilling out as well. I became lost in the isolationist atmosphere and didn't want it to end. <br><br>If you peer at the store page for this game and look at the user tags you would think that this is a game in the same genre as Dear Esther and the other &quot;walking simulator&quot; sorts of games. In some instances this is accurate, but in Lifeless Planet you have more than just your feet to work with. You are in a space suit with a jetpack! So while this game is semi-casual most of the time, there are a fair amount of platforming situations in which you must use the jetpack to make some pretty intense jumps now and then. I wouldn't say that this is extremely difficult to do, but you don't just walk from point to point here like a &quot;walking simulator&quot; would suggest. Not only that, but there are puzzles that you will come into contact with that force you to ponder the environment a bit as well as some technology to help you solve these puzzles. So it definitely delves into much more gameplay than just walking from story point to story point. <br><br>Besides the tags being somewhat misleading, that META Score is completely off base in my opinion. Lifeless Planet is a fantastic game with a fantastic atmosphere, a cornucopia of map changes that will give you an explosion of color in some areas that is intensified by the more \u201cLifeless\u201d areas you will find. The game has about 20 different areas with about 15 of them feeling like something completely different from the rest. Each area can be blown through in 10-15 minutes if you want to unless there are puzzles to get through, but anyone that enjoys looking at scenery and taking their time to explore game worlds should find more joy. (While discussing the want for even more little discoveries outside collectibles like random gravestones and such to add to the flavor of the world on the forums the developer said that they will be adding in more of this in a future patch.) It is not open world, but the areas feel wide and spacious enough that you will be able to wander a bit. Not to mention that there are some collectible items such as minerals and documents found in the game to give you a reason to check some of the back corners. Documents, which add a great deal of the story aspects to the game tend to be on the main path, however so you shouldn't miss any of these. <br><br>The soundtrack is used sparingly, but feels like when the music comes into play it is escalating the situation and your feeling of isolation and the importance of where you are. It creeps into the feeling of the game and gives you the impression that it is pushing you towards an important moment when it begins to quietly chime in as you move forward. Most of the time, however the isolation you feel is intensified by the ambient sounds of a barren world. Winds and other strange sounds like rocks falling while looking into a great chasm add to the effects of your play. <br><br>The story is mysterious, creepy, and interesting. While the main protagonist is your view into Lifeless Planet, you can hear the echos of others throughout your exploration in documents. Some documents contain a sound file in which you can read along as a Russian speaker transcribes it in their own language. It is a Russian speaking voice from someone native to the language as well so it feels authentic. Based solely on the game's title graphic, it is obvious that there is a Russian aspect to the game, but a Russian aspect from the Soviet Union of old. While you are an astronaut from the United States, and there is a Soviet Union background within the game, it does not delve into politics of any sort, nor does it make any statements about either of these nations, or any conflict they had other than maybe a passing note here, or there if necessary to understand the story within the game. The story is one of DISCOVERY, and what it would be like for someone to travel many light years away from Earth and to explore a new world. Their excitement with seeing new forms of life, as well as their struggles with dealing with the unknown. <br><br>The best part of the story to me, however is your own discovery of something else being there, and your interactions with it throughout the game. Very little communication is had as you feel it out and it brings an aspect of humanity to the game that is wonderfully done I feel. Without talking, or actively communicating you do feel a sense of closeness to something while making your way to the end. It is too spoilerish to discuss it really, but it is something I feel should be mentioned because the impression you will get mostly looking at this game is that you are fighting the planet and the story is just one of looking at the past more than anything else. This is a major part, but there is the sci-aspect that all good sci-fi stories have in which humanity and human experience comes into play. <br><br>Graphically the game is solid and gives you a great many screenshot opportunities. The game uses a bit of a filter on it that you would see if you were on such a place to blur it up some, but it is clear for the most part. On the outside of the FOV you will see blurring on the edges, however. Even on fantastic the game looks very good, but it is definitely not a AAA title quality level of HD graphics. For an Indie title they are great though and they fit the game perfectly. <br><br>Gamepad support is good and is preferable to me while playing the game. I used a PS3 gamepad with Xbox 360 plugins and it worked fine the entire game. <br><br>The game is predominantly bug free from my playthrough except there seems to be a bug with an Achievement that the developer has said will be addressed in a patch coming soon. There is an Achievement in which you must collect all documents in game, but as of now it seems the few of us that have looked for this final document to unlock the achievement cannot find it. The document is known to exist from the game files, but does not appear to be in the game anywhere. The developer is quite active on the forums and said they will fix this soon so there should be no worries here. <br><br>TL;DR\/BOTTOM LINE: Lifeless Planet is a great game that will appeal more to a casual gamer from a gameplay standpoint, but to a wider audience of gamers who like sci-fi mysteries, exploring new worlds, and feeling the isolation of a lost planet. The developer, David Board and his team should be proud of their work and congratulate themselves on an epic and unique game. I loved it all the way through and plan to play it again. There is an Achievement to beat the game in under 4 hours, so it could be completed in under that time, however it would be a complete waste to blow through it that quickly. It took me close to 10 hours to finish the game taking my sweet time. There is an Achievement for playing 10+ hours in one game as well too, and I got that without actually having to just idle the game so it is possible to spend over 10 hours in it easily. <br><br>9\/10 Space Suits\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12583335', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12583335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12583335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12583335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12583335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12583335', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12583335_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12583335_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16812678\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Radekus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"48487936\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Radekus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48487936\">Gamechanger<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Radekus\/games\/?tab=all\">110 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Radekus\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Radekus\/recommended\/261530\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 30, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's cute, not worth more than 5 dollars though. <br>There are moments where movement and level design become a problem. <br>Story is meh, could've been better.

like and trust me when i say i did,i &quot;REALLY DID&quot;.<br>The graphics really suit this game and do a good job of portraying the lifeless nature of a barren planet devoid of all life and the vistas and sites you will see in game would not look out of place in a full blown sci-fi film (hope someone takes note as this would make one of the best sci-fi films ever),the sound does a really good job of putting you in the position of being the astronaut stuck on the lifeless planet with the weird sound effects and music that you hear at times doing all they can to portray that lifeless feeling of loneliness the game is aiming for.<br>The story is really entertaining and very mysterious (and pure sci-fi gold) and at times lost me a little (but in the best of ways),lets just say you are on a mission from which there is no return to a planet that could sustain life,you have lost all contact with the other crew members you came down to the planet with,so alone you then discover that you dont have enough oxygen in your tank and so you wander of to find some (and the other crew members) as your tank only holds so much and it has run out (right at the start of the game-HELL thats considerate) and this game play mechanic comes into play a few times through the game and some of these times it can be quite nerve wracking as you wonder if you will find that next oxygen tank to get your levels back upto normal (they are usually somewhere near but can be a pain to find as you run out of that life sustaining O2).<br>As you play you come across various puzzles that need solving for you to progress and most of the time these are quite easy to solve (some of them stumped me quite a bit though i must admit),and this is where the robotic arm comes into its own.<br>This device offers you the chance to reach out of place switches and also reach those heavy out of place item's you just wouldent get to without it,which in turn then leads to the robotic arm then helping to solve that puzzle that has been getting on your nerves for the last 30 minutes.<br>Your booster pack also plays a huge part in the game and without it you just wouldent get past those really hard platforming areas to get access to the next area and therefore uncover more of the mystery that this planet holds.Your booster only has a limited boost capability (normally just one charge) and can only boost you once so in some of the situations you find yourself in you need to go and find the special tank that provides you with those extra charge's you need,so instead of one boost charge you can have upto between 4 or 6 which really helps out with those hard to do areas that without these extra charges you just would not over come.<br>Lets get back to the story (dont worry wont give anything away),the script that accompanies the game as you play is one that kept me fully hooked and i must admit that i havent come across such good writing in a game in a long time,as it turns and twists its way right up until one of the best and most satisfying endings it has been my privalige to play through to get to in what seems like a life time of playing games.<br>In summing up this game would you enjoy it well answer the following questions and make your own mind up--<br>1 - Would you like to play a game unlike anything you have played before and which also has one of the best and most engrossing storylines any game has had in quite some time ??<br>2 - Are you a huge SCI-FI game fan who is looking for that something different and unlike any other SCI-FI game you have ever played ????<br>If you answer yes to both of the above what are you waiting for buy this game now,and if not then you will be missing out on not just one of the best sci-fi games ever made,but in this reveiwers humble opinion one of the best games that the medium has seen in quite some time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

( which she did but it happen after every single russian colonist have killed by the lifeform there which i presume took a lot of time to kill them all). <br><br>Honestly i feel sad for those colonist because they didn't expect such thing would happen to them but honestly speaking they deserve it in a way, they have shortcut and they use it to the fullest. they don't deserve to be on that planet,they didn't take a leap for mankind or a small step for man, they just stand there and have silver platter giving to them,the director for the colonist understand this concept and even he know that they don't deserve here<br><br>In the end, the colonist mission are doom to failed due to they took too many shortcut and rely on the alien tech for everything they do compare to the astronaut crew who came to the world using they own tech, sure nearly all the crew is dead but at least they prove that they have the tech and knowledge needed to get to this planet meaning they at least earn it through they own tech with blood,sweat and tear while the colonist just use the alien tech to get to the world without any effort giving, sure they work hard to build every building, equipment and other stuff in the planet but they still use the alien tech to fasten they arrival there including using the alien power source as they own power<br><br>well that the end of my story, to everyone that read this till the end, thank you for reading this and have a nice day\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30808854', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30808854' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30808854\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30808854' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30808854\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30808854', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30808854_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30808854_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30689266\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979827095\/recommended\/261530\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"19561367\">MavengeE<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI liked this game.  <br>I'd love to see a game like this with much, much more content.   It was the game I wanted to play but not enough of it.  It was atmospheric and thoughtful, and while the emptiness of it really added to the feeling,  I'd still like to see more to it.  Get it on sale and you won't be disappointed.  It's not a puzzle game, just a few minor things, it's more about the atmosphere and the back story.   It does some things very well and captures a mood that few games can capture.  Something lost and empty; a mysterious dreamlike quality...  tons of potential for this kind of game.

I mean this in the most flattering way. The game offers very little in terms of challenge, and it can get quite repetitive, but as interactive storytelling it works quite well. It helps that some of the alien landscapes on the Premier Edition, like the volcanic Inferno level, are truly breathtaking at first glance (hence the Myst comparison). If anything threw me off it was the character models, which look as if they could've used a little more design or better texturing. But considering this is mostly the work of one guy, David Board, I am willing to be lenient. Bottom line: Lifeless Planet is a nice short trip that may or may not stick with you, but either way you'll be glad you decided to take it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30208522', 'recent_short' );
