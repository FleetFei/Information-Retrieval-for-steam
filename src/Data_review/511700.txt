Definitely recommended. If you enjoy tetris this game is for you. It has simple mechanics, but as the intensity picks up it provides plenty of challenges. I found myself playing over and over again trying to beat the high scores. There are a ton of achievements to unlock. This will make a great party game trying to see who can get the best score. <br><br>You will see me refrence tetris here many times as its the easiest thing I can compare it to.<br><br>This game doesnt have a ton of content right now, but neither does Tetris, or Space Pirate Trainer (SPT), or Hover Junkers, etc. They are all about simple addictive game play and beating the high score. Tetris is really simple but continues to be played for many years. Thats what I think this is going for. <br><br>There is a lot of little detail that add up to a quality game. Professional art, music, and voice acting. The art and models look great and they all stick to a consistent theme. The music is awesome! Very addicting tracks! The voice acting is hilarious and fits perfectly with the overall theme. The posters are creative and amusing. the sky fades from day to night and accurately casts shadows. All these little details add up to a quality game with total immersion.<br><br>pros:<br>-simple mechanics, addicting game play<br>-great music, art, voice acting<br>-well thought out design and environment<br>-the immersion is real<br>-lots of potential for new mechanics and creativity<br><br>cons:<br>- needs more music tracks and the other game modes!<br>- can we get the OST? :P<br>- no multiplayer yet (its an upcoming feature)<br>- there are a few bugs, but nothing that gets in the way (it is early access after all)<br>- Endurance mode needs another lose condition<br>- the challenge mode levels need some diversity. Each level only seemed to add a little more speed. Theres a lot of ways you can imagine they could add different spice to each level though.<br><br>additional comments:<br>Endurance mode needs some additional way to lose. From what I can tell you can sit there forever and just lose a point for each block not placed. The only way to lose is to have 3 blocks explode.<br><br>You can get streaks of blocks of colors you dont need. its ok but it feels like it should be smarter about what it gives you (similiar to tetris). It could also use more shapes. <br><br>The 3 prong shape felt really hard to use. I almost always intentionally left it go unless it was an obvious place or an empty box. There may already be, but it feels like the more complex shapes should have a bonus to motivate you to play them. In tetris you dont have a choice to pass on shapes.<br><br>Summary:<br>Overall I definitely recommend this game. Its early access with a ton potential to grow. You can tell the developers have put in a huge amount of effort and seem dedicated to future development. I am excited to see what they come up with next!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26058637', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26058637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26058637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26058637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26058637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26058637', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26058637_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26058637_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/511700\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 3 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["26058637"]}
