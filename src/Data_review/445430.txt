I'm only writing this now because literally no one else has written a review yet :\/<br><br>First thing first, this is a visual novel(VN) so if you don't know what that means or don't like visual novels you probably shouldn't start here, mostly because this is a sequel to another game, Aselia the eternal. For the longest time I thought it was only thematically a sequel but that isn't the case, it is a true sequel. You could play this before Aselia, but I loved Aselia so much I would hate you if you did that :[<br><br>Special note: this is the All ages - Special edition, If you want the adult scenes purchase it on j-list.<br><br>If you are still reading this and are like &quot;I don't know about VNs but that combat system looks interesting&quot;, after 3 hours of gameplay there have been 2 choices and only scripted battles. From my experience with the prequel the battles will be much more important and take up a larger portion of the game, but if you just want the strategy game portion and are the type to skip cutscenes, there is a lot to skip.<br><br>If I haven't dissuaded you yet let's actually get into what makes this game good so far. I really love how much detail the Eternity Sword games have to their world. It takes it's time establishing it's characters and their relationships, what they eat, how they live, the language they speak, the day to day chores. This was what grabbed me so hard about Eien no Aselia and that level of detail is here as well. It would be annoying if the sped through the first chapter to get to the fighting faster, because the characters motivations wouldn't be as developed. <br>That said I feel there are a few things that take me out of it. There was one scene that confused me because it jumped away from the protagonist to see a conversation we wouldn\u2019t know about, which is fine, except the protagonist was on their way to that room and it seemed for a bit he was listening in to it but he wasn\u2019t and it made me kinda glitch out <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/(https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cEzVllYsbH8#t=154m10s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >(https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cEzVllYsbH8#t=154m10s<\/a> if you wanna see in my video my reaction, it is a like 5 minute scene and i don\u2019t figure it out until after the scene.)<br><br>I also felt that certain characters we see in chapter one should have spoken in Phantasmagorian (their special made up language) so we wouldn\u2019t know anything about what they were up to the first time through, but oh well.<br><br>The art has a similar style to it as the previous title but it shows that it is a newer title in how clean the art is. Art is too subjective for me to say it\u2019s good or bad, I like the designs of all the charactors, if you want to see for yourself the art check some videos.<br><br>The music isn\u2019t anything really special, but the use of the music is on point and I would suggest playing it with the music as it really helps set the emotional moods and makes it more immersive.<br><br>All in all it is a worthy successor to Eien no Aselia, and I\u2019m looking forward to finishing it.<br><br>I streamed onto youtube the prolog and chapter 1 with a friend of mine, if you wanna see some of that to get a feel of the game check it out here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cEzVllYsbH8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cEzVllYsbH8<\/a><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29555148', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29555148' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29555148\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29555148' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29555148\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29555148', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29555148_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29555148_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29619889\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xhh2a\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"102943091\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xhh2a\/\" data-miniprofile=\"102943091\">xhh2a<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xhh2a\/games\/?tab=all\">78 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xhh2a\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xhh2a\/recommended\/445430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst off, this was translated by Aroduc so if you like previous translations from Seiha then get the game. I know that on the blog for the translation there were complaints about removing flavor text from the second page of abilities to display what the ability does. I PREFER the way Aroduc translates because having what the abilities do is FAR MORE IMPORTANT imho than random flavor text. That bein said, Aroduc does try to localize sometimes so if you are a 'purist' then you probably won't like it.<br><br>Second, this is one of the only game heavy VNs licensed in English in existence right now. So if you want a VN with good gameplay, BUY this to send a message to the industry for more. In addition, if you are put off by typical JRPG games due to grinding, this game does not require heavy grinding but rather smart gameplay.<br><br>This game is still a VN however, as evidenced by the very long intro (2-4 hours before a real battle) and numerous dialogues in between each campaign. Plot wise it follows the standard 'call to action' -&gt; 'journey' -&gt; 'climax' -&gt; 'denoumont' format of fiction. It does try to put in a few mature real life scenes. It follows the setting of introducing characters in a school setting to try to connect to (I guess the target audience) and then transports them to the actual story setting like Muv Luv does.<br><br>With regards to the gameplay I would describe it as a simpler Madou Koukaku\/Nobunaga's Ambition without empire building and better battle mechanics. Madou Koukaku is an anime fantasy themed Total War like SRPG (except not translated into English). Nobunaga's Ambition is a Total War like game as well.<br><br>For a more mainstream comparison, imagine controlling armies on the world map from Fire Emblem Awakening and having turn based Rock paper scissors combat instead of a tactical grid.<br><br>Do note that this game took a long time to get onto Steam from release so art assets are dated somewhat. I think the art looks fine as it is. As a disclaimer, if you are looking for Eushully like quality or more modern art quality you will be dissapointed. I would say the art quality is a notch above Recettear and around the same as Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon.<br><br>Lastly if you are looking for the non all ages version you should buy from other sites. Or honestly you should just go and buy Sakura Dungeon or something because that will get you want you want for far less effort. I think the all ages version is fine so far and they added new scenes for the all ages version.<br><br>Advice for playing: - Turn off combat animations in settings after the first campaign (cutscenes prior to that won't make sense without animation). Save frequently! If you lose a battle you have to restart the campaign. Also build artificats early on that increase Mana conversion rate, you will want it later.<br>_____<br>Aside: I kinda wish they made a 2D campaign map though, Madou Koukaku had a prettier 2D map and honestly for indier games like Nobunaga's Ambition or Seinarukana 2D looks so much better than 3D and it's cheaper too. Oh, and if you are reading this JAST: I would love a translation of Madou in English because machine translation is unintelligable.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29619889', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29619889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29619889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29619889' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29619889\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29619889', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29619889_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29619889_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30272929\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078329875\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"118064147\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36cfed44856992dc3f7eb6c7e360d204d3b1e6e0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36cfed44856992dc3f7eb6c7e360d204d3b1e6e0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/36\/36cfed44856992dc3f7eb6c7e360d204d3b1e6e0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078329875\/\" data-miniprofile=\"118064147\">butterbattle22<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078329875\/games\/?tab=all\">54 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078329875\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078329875\/recommended\/445430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">154.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSeinarukana is a lengthy game with 6 possible routes (my hours aren't accurate since I left it on while doing other stuff...). It's about 50% visual novel and 50% SRPG, imo. Your choices and gameplay matter for which route you get. With that said, each route simply focuses on a specific heroine in your harem, and the mechanics for getting the end you want is fairly obvious. It's technically a sequel to Aselia the Eternal, but other than taking place within the same universe (er.....multiverse) and a couple small easter eggs (<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Tokimi is still best girl<\/span><\/span>) this is completely stand-alone, and you won't lose anything from skipping the first one. <br><br>On the strategy side, units take turns traveling on points along fixed lines, with each point having small stat modifiers and healing\/leveling\/etc. taking place in towns. In this series, units are generally squads of 3 characters, with an 'attacker,' 'defender,' and 'supporter.' When your squad of 3 sprites meets an enemy squad of 3, they proceed to take turns beating each other up within that 'encounter' in a different screen. The vast majority of your tactics lies in how you organize your squads and their abilities (and there is a dizzying plethora of abilities) rather than how you move them, although that's important too.   <br><br>I personally enjoyed the story of the first game a bit more. The dark tone and sense of desperation that persisted for so much of Aselia was addictive. Additionally, the harem cliches are slightly stronger in this one, which is always a bad thing in my book. However, I still enjoyed the characters, and I don't want to give too much away, but while I like the Iliad better, the Odyssey has some charm as well. So in the end, it's an apple and an orange. <br><br>The SRPG side is significantly improved from the first game. They got rid of the stupid mind mechanic and added something called combat mana. The outcome of each encounter is no longer predetermined. Your typical encounter now plays out in 10 turns (each side takes 5), so skills no longer have multiple 'actions.' Your skills cost 'combat mana,' and your characters only charge 2 combat mana per turn, so if a skill costs more than that, it won't occur. You can change the positions in your squad every turn, and the AI NOW CHANGES POSITION TOO! This adds a small element of luck since the enemy behavior differs from squad to squad. <br><br>Unfortunately, a few issues from the first game are still present. In particular, the awkwardness of constructing buildings and manually leveling up your characters to prepare for unknown threats while trying to finish a mission as quickly as possible has not gone away. The weirdest part of it is that in the first game, you were often trying to survive the onslaught of an enemy horde on your decrepit villages, so towers were ubiquitous. In contrast, in Seinarukana, every mission is an offensive campaign, your buildings will only last for two or three missions max, but it offers a smorgasbord of defensive buildings. I literally built defensive buildings on one mission in this entire game, and even on that occasion, it panned out that I was just overreacting and didn't need them. <br><br>tl;dr<br>- Story was good but not amazing? Like a 6-8\/10 <br>- Tactics is a lot better, but still has a couple of flaws.<br>- If you enjoyed the first one, it's almost guaranteed you'll like this one too.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30272929', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30272929' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30272929\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30272929' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30272929\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30272929', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30272929_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30272929_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/445430\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 7 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30565160","29555148","29619889","30272929"]}
