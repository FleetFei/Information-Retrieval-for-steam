If you liked any of the following games:<br>- Terraria (similar in terms of item stylization and stack sizes\/tools\/building\/npcs)<br>- MU Online (back in the day)<br>- Any roguelike game (because this isn't 100% roguelike, but it's a sick hybrid)<br>- Turnbased strategy games.<br>- Runescape (similar in terms of skills and money)<br>- Sprite based games.<br>- Open world games.<br>- Challenging games.<br>- Games with a decently large amount of content.<br>- Games that don't seem to constantly crash, even run smoothly with very low CPU usage.<br>- Games with attention to detail:<br> -- You can get hurt mining.<br> -- When you talk to someone asleep you scream them awake.<br>  -- Drinking and eating give you buffs at full health.<br>  -- You get a puppy from the start, and it does fun stuff with you.<br> -- Many, many, many versitle ways to make money.<br>  -- Some notes you pick up are dirty and you have to dust them off to read them.<br>  -- Bugs can randomly appear in your backpack.<br>  -- Hitting a deer with a fireball and killing it cooks it % based on damage.<br><br>It's just a lot of small love that adds up to a good game, I'm actually struggling to come up with too many bad things...<br><br>The kind of bad (so far, I'm only on chapter one):<br>- Building is limited to a special 'safe' area.<br>- AI tracking seems a little bit off, I always seem to outrun NPCs.<br>- Then again, if it wasn't off I'd be getting \u2665\u2665\u2665-blasted every four seconds, so at least it helps when you play as a mage.<br>- Bosses are hella hard when playing on hard. I always go for the challenge, but I'm having to grind a bit; which, all in all, when there's plenty of random crap to explore, I don't mind that much.<br>- Music cycle seems repetitive, but not awful. In the starter city you do notice the loop though; and it's slightly taxing on the ears. The ambience easily makes up for it though. Amazing cricket\/bird\/wind\/rain noises.<br><br>Beyond that, dude, for $15? If you're complaining about the price you don't understand how the economy works.

Booted it up, started a character on Master difficulty. Died so many times that I... insert Dark Souls meme joke here.<br><br>YMMV, but Master difficulty t'aint fer thee faint o' haart, laddy!<br><br>I've only played ~10 hours, but I feel like that's enough time to get a good impression of the game and leave a review for those of you who are still on the fence. If you like CRPGs...<br><br>BUY IT NOW!!! It's more than worth the price. It's a bit like Eschalon, for those of you who've played that game, but Balrum is expanded and improved in just about every way. It's a touch o' the old Ultima Online about it, too. Just a touch. And it's a good touch. Not a bad touch.<br><br>I'm rather eager to get back to playing, so LET'S DO THIS THING:<br><br>Brutal, rewarding difficulty? Check. See inserted Dark Souls meme above. (My last death was to a giant praying mantis that prayed away my mana, poisoned me with its horrifying pincers, and healed itself when I finally had it down to a sliver of health. I died to poison as I ran for shelter, sobbing.)<br><br>Varied, multidimensional crafting? Check. I can't even. The crafting is strong with this one.<br><br>Free-form base building? Check. Build a house, build a fortress, build an orchard, build a farm, build a pigpen, build a spiderpen. DON'T LEAVE THE GATE OPEN ON THE SPIDERPEN FOR THE LOVE OF web web web venom venom death<br><br>Customizable pet? Check. I'm currently running with a giant shadow-magic-wielding rat named Boggles. And that praying mantis monstrosity I was telling you about? Also tameable. The world shall fear my giant green bug... as soon as my skill-level is high enough to tame giant green bugs.<br><br>Stats? Check. I almost came to tears over stat distribution. The game is neither kind nor generous, but I must have Stockholm syndrome, because I don't even car.<br>Care.<br><br>Skills? Check. More in-depth than the stats, I felt. Most skills have at least two significant effects, and sometimes three or four. And again, the game does not hand out &quot;learning points&quot; often, so they really matter. Ranks in the Survival skill don't just let you heal more HP at the tents you build, they also let you cure ailments like broken bones, increase the light radius of your torch, slow Fatigue\/Hunger\/Thirst growth rates, and give you a double digit % chance to avoid death whenever you hit 0 hp.<br>THAT'S A SKILL, BETHESDA.<br><br>Varied spells, combat and utility? I think so! (I just came across a teleportation spell that I hope to use mischievously. Combat spells are most certainly varied. I've been using one that creates crystalline walls to great effect.)<br><br>Factions? Check, the system is there and the character sheet has a faction affiliation section, but I'm not far enough to have actually... affiliated.<br>Giggity.<br><br>M-to-the-ASSIVE world to explore? Check. You have no idea. I've barely mapped out \u00bc of the first map, and that's not including dungeons, chests I couldn't open, beasts and the locations they guarded that I couldn't tackle yet, etc.<br><br>Secrets and treasures and quests in every nook and cranny as far as the eye can see?<br>Check-checkity-check-check-check.<br><br>Brutal, immersive survival elements? Balrum is to Minecraft as Saw is to Teletubbies.<br>Or maybe I should reverse that?<br>Teletubbies are pretty scary.<br>Balrum is to Minecraft as Teletubbies are to Danny Devito.<br><br>...<br><br>...<br><br>I mean Check.<br><br>Dying of dehydration? Find a well, eat a watermelon, collect falling rainwater (if it's raining, newb) and fill your cantine, or heck, collect swampy puddle water in a bucket if you're desperate. (Pray it doesn't have maggots in it.)<br><br>Dying of starvation? Hunt deer, chop down a tree, build a campfire with the wood, cook the meat on the spot, eat the meat. Or shoot a newborn fawn with a fireball, skip the campfire stage, and eat fire-ball-grilled baby-meat with half the effort. Then find an outhouse. (Outhouse for roleplaying purposes only. Assembly required, pooping optional.)<br><br>Oh, and one time I found a bug in my character's backpack eating all the apples I'd just picked. I squashed the little bugger (lol) with my bare hands. Don't touch my apples. ACTUAL THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME SERIOUSLY.<br><br>I've not run into any major bugs so far. (Except the one in my backpack.) The game has a classy, retro look that I absolutely dig.<br><br>It's a really good CRPG. There's less choices in dialogue than there should be, (at least in the first main area, which I'm still in,) the writing can be a bit too info-dumpy, and I have yet to find any Necromantic skeleton-army-animating spells, but apart from that, it's a real gem.<br><br>TL;DR: For the current price of thirteen-ish USD, Balrum is a criminal steal.<br><br>Oh, robbing people blind and getting away with it?

Make sure you are cool with that before considering purchasing this game even for another moment...<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9H3OUDzqN8s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9H3OUDzqN8s<\/a><br><br>Good?  Now imagine you starting off in an all too familiar RPG back story... we've heard this same sort of story many times before and as you start the game and read the dialogue, you'll swear it's deja vu again.  ..You were a kid and your parents died to some horrible death, something so bad that even dear old grandfather can't bear to tell you anything about it.  Something awful happened is all that you know and your grandfather raised you well as other nearby people of the NPC type taught you some basic skills such as basic carpentry, a little bit of alchemy, etc.  Twenty years later, you now wake up with dear old granfather just a little older, but still much superior to you with ten times your starting HP and MP etc and theres rumors of someone with a torch trying to burn your granddfather and your wooden house down and they burned down the house completely of a nearby family.<br><br>And that is where you start.  You'll get to wander around exploring the town and visiting all the NPC people, choosing what to say and what tasks you'd like to complete.  The great thing here is that every quest feels like it has a real purpose, none of the &quot;go kill 10 wolves&quot; or &quot;go collect 10 butterfly sacs&quot; garbage that drive so many of us RPG fans bonkers.  It's refreshing to have quests that actually feel like they serve a purpose.. things like chopping down trees in a forest and buying nails from another NPC to repair a burnt down wall of a house or fixing another npcs crop field fence.<br><br>Be careful as well in this game.. Don't think you can just walk in people's house and start snooping through their chests and taking whatever you like because doing so in their line of sight will pi.ss them off and have them attacking you until either you or them dies.  I love that.<br><br>So let's talk about the UI...  it's a little awkward to get used to for sure and will take time.  For example sending in your pet (yes you can have pets you command and who serve you) ... but sending your pet to attack an enemy require you left clicking the target foe.  But for you to attack, you need to choose your attack and then right click on the same foe.  ..That's just one example of how the UI can be almost overwhelmingly confusing when you begin.  But soon, you'll get the hang of it and feel much more comfy with the game that definitely doesn't hold your hand.  <br><br>My biggest gripe early on is the hunger and thirst survival mechanics of the game.  I chose the normal difficulty and haven't tried the easy mode yet but...  at this early point into the game (4 hours), the thirst and hunger is almost annoying because it feels like every 30 seconds, you have to drink or eat.  Fail to notice these chat messages or icons in the upper right of your screen, you in no time flat you'll be near death from damage taken from &quot;invisible pain&quot; due to hunger or thirst.  The solution?  Easy once you figure out to stock plenty of food on you and hydrate and eat to 150% of both thirst &amp; hunger each morning when you wake up.  <br><br>The hybrid turn based mechanic is one I really like.  It means that every NPC (including enemies) move and do their thing and time moves if you stand still or if you are working to complete tasks.. it's a real time game, except once you engage or once an enemy engages you into the games combat.  Once you are in combat, whether your choice or not, it's all a slower, much more strategic life-or-death turn based battle where any wrong move could be the difference between you surviving ot dying and re-loading the game from your last save point.<br><br>There's also a rune your grandfather gives you early in the game that you'll want to put in your hot bar immediately.  I didn't even notice it until 4 hours in, and it allows you to click it anytime to be whisked away to a safe facet of your existence where the map looks the same, but no other npcs including enemies exist.  It's your safe haven, and when you first go there, there is a huge empty prarie the size of the small town all your own.. a place you can build your dream home and escape to any time you wish.  There, you are given a nice starting supply of resources to help get you started building whatever home you want, and pressing the B key (for Build) opens up a generous build menu where you can build your dream home, place furniture, trees, shrubs, chests, etc.  This safe zone is an awesome feature that I absolutely love and to me is something that takes this game over-the-top.<br><br>While this game has it's steep learning curve and interesting UI to get used to, it offers a depth rarely seen in even the most hyped triple-A RPG games.  This is certainly not a review where I've played the full game and can tell you exactly how much depth it has, but at four hours in, I feel like someone here on earth looking up into the sky at all the stars thinking OMG WOW.  It feels like I haven't even scratched 1% of this games offerings at 4 hours in.  There are tons of ingredients everywhere for crafting and alchemy, more then you can shake a stick at.  There are dozens of dungeons I haven't even begun to explore.  There is a safe zone area I've only started to build my house on.  And there are so many strange creatures I've stayed away from seen peering at me from the thick woods beyond the town.  When I get killed by two spiders near the town or a bear on the edge of town, I can't even begin to think of battling whatever evils exist in the depths of the woods or all of those dungeons yet.  And THAT is a feeling that leaves you in awe as you are learning the ropes and UI of this game and completing all the many tasks and quests available at the start.<br><br>There is no doubt in my mind that this game will be up for &quot;RPG of the year&quot; on many peoples lists to choose the best-of-the-best from once 2016 is over.  It's refreshing to see, especially at this games surprisingly lose price point.  Many people will compare this game to Diablo or Diablo 2 looking at the graphics, but I have played both of those games long ago, and from my early game time in Balrum, this game may not be an action RPG like Diablo or throw quite so much crazy loot out, but it looks to have a depth that far surpasses both Diablo and Diablo 2.  It does have a steep learning curve, and a strange UI that takes getting used to, but I think this game is one that any true RPG fan shouldn't miss!<br><br>Once I complete this game, I'll come back and give it a proper review, and share how many hours I spent beating it.  Until then, here is my scoring just based on what I've experienced so far...<br><br>Value (Worth 40 points max) :  40, no doubt about it, this game delivers crazy over-the-top value and likely hundreds of hours of gameplay for it's small asking price.<br><br>Fun (Worth 30 points max):  27, very high fun value in my opinion and I expect the fun to increase as I get even deeping into this games lore and gameplay.  This score will be very subjective depending on what style of game you prefer, but I can't see any true RPG fan not having a hell of a time with Balrum.<br><br>Controls &amp; Bugs (Worth 20 points max):  A few weird control mechanisms lower this score, and the steep learning curve also plays in because it certainly could leave many players feeling over-whelmed... but I'm giving this game a solid 15 out of 20.<br><br>Graphics &amp; Sound (Worth 10 points max):  The least important aspect of any game when it comes to value and overall fun that can be had in my opinion, but this game delivers an old school style of graphics that is both dark and classic awesomeness and I love it!  8 out of 10 here from me!<br><br>My initial score that I'd be shocked to see it change much:  90%  Very Solid A-minus grade from me and a MUST BUY for RPG fans at this price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21558506', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21558506' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21558506\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21558506' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21558506\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21558506', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21558506_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21558506_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t66 of 91 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21556713\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970128471\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"9862743\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6b4d820bef79961cbbdaceeba8aa99da2f9fce30.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6b4d820bef79961cbbdaceeba8aa99da2f9fce30.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6b\/6b4d820bef79961cbbdaceeba8aa99da2f9fce30_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970128471\/\" data-miniprofile=\"9862743\">Sevens<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970128471\/games\/?tab=all\">257 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970128471\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970128471\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">64.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo far so good.  Great production value for a small team and small file size.  Nice rpg elements and survival aspects.  RPG elements allow for initial character creation of Fighter, Mage, or Archer.  The game starts you off with a pet wolf that is of some help in the begining.  The controls for the game are intuitive.  It's realtime\/turn based.  Move around the world in real time, when you are not moving time is standing still.  The system is similar to the Echelon RPG games, but the animations and graphics are a step up compared to that series. Survival aspects consist of hunger, health, and thirst.  The game has a variety of crafting and cooking options for the survival aspect, also hunting, gathering, and alchemy.  There are a variety of tools you have to have to perform various jobs, and these are auto selected when you go about performing a job, such as mining or chopping wood.   Artwork and music are top notch and you are able to zoom in and out in the game's isometric perspective.  Overall I feel that this game is a great value, lots of content and gameplay options for the price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21556713', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21556713' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21556713\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21556713' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21556713\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21556713', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21556713_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21556713_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21667029\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cuchulane\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93102206\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32532ff865eca11de9ee02a7d34c573cf340d3d2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32532ff865eca11de9ee02a7d34c573cf340d3d2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/32\/32532ff865eca11de9ee02a7d34c573cf340d3d2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cuchulane\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93102206\">Cuchulane<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cuchulane\/games\/?tab=all\">349 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cuchulane\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cuchulane\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">46.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWow, such an addictive game.<br><br>I look at the shortcuts on my desktop this morning when I get up, ready for full Sunday of gaming. There's Elder Scrolls Online, there's my Witcher 3 expansions, Balrum... and I instantly go back to Balrum. There is something so compelling about the opportunities for exploration, crafting advancement, and building opportunities. Of course, at the heart of any RPG is the quests, and the quests in Balrum have a great feel to them. There is a really interesting story arc building from the quests and I really want to see where it leads.<br><br>What really makes a great RPG is the feeling of investing in a character that seems real, where the player can truly take on a role that offers an escape into a separate life. It has been many years since I have felt suach an instant attachement to a character, and it does remind me of the way I used to lose myself into RPG's back in the 80's and 90's.<br><br>RPG fans owe it to themselves to buy this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21667029', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21667029' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21667029\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21667029' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21667029\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21667029', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21667029_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21667029_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21819456\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">Zorder<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/games\/?tab=all\">2,516 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/\">179 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Old school RPG goodness!<\/div><br><b>Balrum<\/b>, which was developed by a two-man team, is an old school RPG with survival elements. What interested me was how it took the basic formula of old school RPGs with turn-based combat and added more fun ingredients to it. It is a pretty simple RPG but it is challenging enough to keep players on their toes.  <br><br>Balrum is not just an RPG, but a survival game as well. It has a hunger\/thirst system, so you have to hunt for resources to keep yourself fed and hydrated. One other characteristic, which I think makes it even more hardcore, is that the map barely gives any information. You have to explore by yourself and add markers to the map, or memorize the locations. Both are a far cry from having a full map handed to you on a silver platter.<br><br>Right before you\u2019re thrown into the world of Balrum you\u2019ll get to choose from a wide variety of starting skills such as farming, alchemy and archery. You also have full control over distributing your stats. Intelligence and wisdom are good for mage-like characters, while strength and vitality help if you're going for a more aggressive approach.<br><br>Story wise, I admit that I haven't gotten far with the main quests, but I've gotten a taste of what is at stake. Many years ago, armies of the undead invaded the world of Balrum. The king's armies were defeated, and a group of people took shelter in the forest of Darkwood. You are part of this group. The story starts off when you realize something is amiss in Darkwood. You embark on a journey to figure out what it is. The game has a lot of dialogue. Be prepared for a good amount of reading, as the game is not voice acted. The writing is fantastic, so I enjoyed reading all of the dialogue.<br><br>A short while into the game, you're given an item that allows you to teleport to a safe haven. It's there that you have resources to build and decorate to your liking. You can build a house with different tiles, walls, furniture, doors, decorations, along with crafting equipment such as an anvil and a whetstone. You\u2019re also able to decorate the outside of your home with different fences, foliage and trees. If you enjoy building, Balrum has you covered!<br><br>There are other optional activites that help to increase your character's combat effectiveness. These include farming, cooking, mining, smelting, hunting, taming, woodcutting, and building. While you can ignore these, I recommend pursuing such activities. They add to your experience, make your life easier, and add variety to the game itself.<br><br>The game involves a lot of looting and searching. That said, your inventory doesn\u2019t have a limit of weight like in some RPGs. Instead, it is divided into food, alchemy, weapons\/tools, armours\/trinkets, scrolls\/recipes, materials and quest items. Each one of these sections has its own limit so you can make sure to carry with you only what is necessary. You can also find letters that contain recipes or hints about certain quests.<br><br>Your journal is where you\u2019ll check your active quests and quests that you\u2019ve already completed. Some quests are given to you by other people, while others appear after your character has a memory triggered. I've been going through every side quest I can find before going on the main quest, and I'm surprised by the development put into the dialogue of these. They don\u2019t feel like fetch quests, and they easily captivated my interest.<br><br><b><u>Pros:<\/u><\/b><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Huge explorable world<br><\/li><li>Lovely soundtrack<br><\/li><li>Well written and interesting dialogue<br><\/li><li>Side activities such as farming, building and crafting<br><\/li><li>Runs on pretty much anything<br><\/li><li>Tons of side quests that feel like actual quests rather than fetch quests<\/li><\/ul><br><b><u>Cons:<\/u><\/b><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I had to use a third party software called \u201cWindowed Borderless Gaming\u201d to get the game running at 144hz.<br><\/li><li>No warning when looting something that is considered stealing.

There is around about an hour of playing before the game mechanics are understood.  I dont really like farming stuff, but it was kind cool in this game.  I didnt do it much though.  I more liked the exploration, and just gathered and hunted for food.<br><br>*** Edit: They seemed to have added a new option to make the hunger\/thirst practically non-existent* Personally I dont need it, and like being a hunter gatherer ***<br><br>Actually, I've notice people are complaining about hunger and thirst - this seems like an issue at first too, as the bars goes down fairly fast especially if you are doing activities.  However its just a temporary thing, you very quickly work out that there is an huge supply of apples and food growing all over the place and lots of dear around that you kill and cook the meat from.  On top of that you have an (almost) unlimited inventory so you can collect a ton of stuff then not worry about it.  Plenty of things to steal too :)<br><br>Lots of secret stuff, dialog and some really good game systems (day\/night cycle has a few in-game effects - hint: why are these rocks that look normal in the day, glowing at night?)<br><br>Looks MASSIVE.  I mean, really massive - you really feel like your out in the wilderness and there is just tons of stuff to discover.<br><br>Please above all else, make sure you use the AUTOSAVE! Set it to every 5 mins or somthing.  Sometimes the game can be tough if you get stuck into a 2v1 fight early in the game.<br><br>Love the old school graphics, reminds me of a zoomed out ultima.<br><br>*** Edit: I made a short video about how to play with hunger and thirst on ***<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AnCwJD276RQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AnCwJD276RQ<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21601049', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21601049' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21601049\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21601049' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21601049\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21601049', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21601049_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21601049_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30093216\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198120632907\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"160367179\">Acer Slasher<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 26.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> Balrum\t<\/div><b> Pros: <\/b><br>+ Farming, Crafting, Hunting, Potion Making, and Cooking<br>+ Stealing<br>+ Pets<br>+ Lots of things to Harvest<br>+ Home Building System<br>+ Decent Main Story with okay Side Stories<br><br><b> Cons: <\/b><br>- Slow Paced<br>- Organizing Inventory<br>- Lots of Walking Around<br><br><b> Review <\/b><br>Balrum makes me think of what would be a old Terraria. I actually was pleasantly surprised by this game. This is a game that I will be playing for a long time. It was a little odd playing this game at first, but I soon found the hours slipping away as me and my dog ran across the forest in search of some game to hunt. That doesn't sound like that would take that long, but then you have to pick some apples, kill a spider that's trying to kill me, drink some water, cut down some trees, then remember that you were trying to hunt deer the whole time. I really enjoy playing this game. I do think that 14.99 is a little too much for it though, but that could just be because I am cheap and\/or poor.<br><br>This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: <br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/PC-BetaG#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/PC-BetaG#curation<\/a><br><br>If you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

Its rather slow - character development takes ages (after 11h I'm on the 4th level). Still missing development points, need to decide if I want to mine,craft armour or weapons... or maybe carpentry? But - I feel I will spend plenty more hours with Balrum. It is addiciting and have a syndrome of &quot;one more turn&quot;. I have a real problem finding games that would give me fun (I've played so many over the years) - but Balrum did it. I can reccomend it for people who can forgive the graphic and wierd controls.

When I'm not playing, I'm usually wishing I was playing.  Balrum just scratches an itch for me and is the perfect game for what I want to play right now.  A lot of the game isn't particularly intuitive, but once you're able to accept some of the rough edges in the UI, it usually plays well.<br><br>Balrum's got a pretty sedate pace, which is a little odd for a game with Hunger, Thirst, and Tiredness meters.  But even though the survival mechanics are reasonably well implemented, they simply aren't strict enough to be problematic once you're clear of the early game.  This isn't Nethack: as long as you pay a bit of attention and plan slightly ahead, you probably won't have &quot;starving&quot; be your most common death.  Since farming and cooking are important mechanics, it's not especially hard to keep yourself going.  The game is perfectly happy to let you spend some time dawdling.  In a bit of a twist, it's usually *your* character that pretends they're in a hurry (&quot;I'll go do that right away!&quot;) and the other characters are much less urgent about the things they ask you to do.<br><br>The combat system is...servicable.  It's nothing very fancy, and I wish there was a bit more depth to it, unfortunately there's just not enough variety in the things you do (and since everything is weighted to a &quot;turn&quot;, this may actually be for the best anyhow).  There's a huge amount of status effects, and roleplaying choices are often rewarded with status effects (though it's somewhat frustrating to get these buffs and then not actually be in any position to do any fighting and take advantage of them). There are a specific set of enemies on any given map, with no respawning, so there is a definite ceiling on your experience.  And since enemies provide very little experience compared to the huge sums you'll quickly start needing to level up, you'll eventually clear things out, just trying to scrape together as much experience as you can.<br><br>Quests provide the bulk of your experience (at least as far as I've gotten in the game) and so you definitely are encouraged to seek them out.  Exploration is often rewarded.  There are some pretty satisfying puzzles, and there are several quests for which the easy answer isn't the best one.  The most valuable resource in the game appears to be the learning points which you spend to get skills.  A big problem is that several of the crafting skills don't seem to have much bang for the buck -- at least not at first, I haven't gotten to the point where they're &quot;decent&quot; -- so it feels like a waste to invest in them (which is a shame, because the crafting system is pretty interesting, though not necessarily intuitive).<br><br>The lore is, at least to me, quite fascinating.  It's scattered around in bits and pieces, and there's often a surprising amount of environmental storytelling -- usually implying a gruesome end to whoever's journal you've been reading.  There are some characters who I wish I could tell things to the game doesn't allow.  I'd love to be able to give Thurza the letter from her husband that you find on his mauled body.<br><br>I sank forty hours into the game, then decided &quot;you know, I *like* this swordplay character, but I'm wondering if I'd be happier as an archer.&quot;  So I started the game over and happily  discovered the answer is &quot;yes&quot; (and then did so again a couple hours later after I discovered that you don't want to take Alchemy as a starting skill -- there's a skill book to teach it to you early on, saving you money and ever-precious learning points; I had always had Alchemy and had picked up Alchemy 2 by the time I got the Herbalism book on my first character, so I didn't get to try out the books and see how they worked until my second character).  <br><br>Balrum really isn't a game for everyone.  Some people won't like the relaxed pace.  Some people won't like the just-barely-deep-enough-to-be-interesting combat.  Some people won't like the quest structures, which often demand exploration and experimentation or don't give you much to go on.  Some people won't care for the survival systems.  But me, man, I love this thing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29535083', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29535083' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29535083\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29535083' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29535083\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29535083', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29535083_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29535083_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29328041\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999914689\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"39648961\">Mark Rushow<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 40.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was a backer. That said I actually really enjoy this game. It keeps me intrigued, wondering, exploring, and trying things out. Typically games I would group with Balrum as of the same type I do not enjoy. There are all these little neat details that are not typical in games. Like lightning stikes giving a buff or low light giving a negative buff, larva showing up in your inventory that need to be squased else they eat your food. To be specific I would have to do a video with voice over. But this game has my support for what it is worth. I must state that most games disapoint me. I may find one or two games a year that are actually fun to play and maybe 1 every 5-10 years that is a game I just can't get enough of. I can see it isn't a game for everyone but it sure is a game for me.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29328041', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29328041' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29328041\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29328041' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29328041\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29328041', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29328041_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29328041_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28722012\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198138188652\/recommended\/424250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"177922924\">RavnosFX<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNice game remind me of Ultima series. Had a lot of fun playing it especially when I could design my own house and a backyard with plants in it to harvest. Crafting system is quite nice had a lot of nice features. You can cook, make your own recipes, brew potions at alchemy bench, make your own armor or weapons, mine and smelt minerals etc.  There are some bugs in dialogs though. The story is nice and there is quite a lot of reading what is expected from a rpg game. I miss out fishing in ponds for extra food so there is no fishing in the game. When you sell off your things in a shop a merchant will eventually run out of money and he won't have more the next day you visit him. Same goes with buying things from him he won't refresh stock the next day so economy in this game is useless. Killing all the animals like deer in the forest will permanently erase the population of deer. Next day you'll visit the forest it will be empty and boring. There is no re-spawn in this game. It's quite sad and game breaking. I thought I could hunt for deer, skin them, make leather armor and sell it to a merchant and make a living out of it. Forget it won't last. Picking all the plants and mushrooms in the forest is also one time only. I remember in Ultima VI and VII there were always new things in the forest to hunt or pickup the next day. So no re-spawn :(  It would be nice to own a mine in this game :) or at least there should be an option to melt down your old sword and make an iron ingot. You can forge a sword out of iron but you can't melt it down at a smelter :) and they said that this game has a deep crafting system :)  I think that if you can put things together you can break them down and use them to built something new. When you brew potions at a alchemy bench you can hear a bubbling sound but when you make swords on an anvil or cook diner there is no sound at all. Character creation is simple you can't choose gender and you can't name your hero everyone is calling you BOY!. There is no race like Black or Asian only Caucasian white to choose from and you can't change your appearance like hair and stuff. This will sound silly but there are no hanging tick-tock clocks in houses :) the only way you can tell time is by pressing &quot; I&quot;  for inventory. This game is a simulation of life of some sort. It would be nice if there were seasons in this game. So in winter a character should be wearing some warm clothes etc. There is a lot of things to do in order to make this game sooo much greater and much more enjoyable.  I hope they will make all of these thing in a dlc or in some upcoming patches. <br><br>Anyway beside my ranting this game is fun to play and I will recommend it to all the fans of old-school rpg's :) Cheers           <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28722012', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28722012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28722012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28722012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28722012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28722012', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28722012_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28722012_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/424250\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 242 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30645528","30705691","30436304","21576771","21663818","21558506","21556713","21667029","21819456","21601049"]}
