There are slight echoes of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (mood and pacing) alongside a subject matter that was reminiscent of the film The VVitch (yes, I know the game predated that film's release) with combat inspired by Skyrim and Far Cry. <br><br>I started the game about 8 months ago and then was pulled away from it after only playing the first few hours due to a busy life schedule. Since then I have started and played other games but Betrayer stood out in my mind and left a lasting mark. I kept thinking about my brief initial experience and finally decided to revisit the game in recent weeks. I am glad I did and played it through to the end. <br><br>Despite some moderate repetition and a playtime that lasted a little longer than the core concept could sustain comfortably I had a very positive experience with the title. I loved the colonial setting which is noticeably underexplored in gaming and the flintlock firearms and bows made for very tense and deliberate combat--just like in Far Cry 2 the experience is best when you crank the enemy difficulty up!<br><br>Overall the strongest element is the unsettling and foreboding mood laced with just enough unexpected disruptions and peripeteia to keep the tension high and the player questioning. This game is worth playing for the setting and the mood and will leave a lasting impression in an age of well-crafted but forgettable alternatives. <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30495599', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30495599' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30495599\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30495599' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30495599\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30495599', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30495599_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30495599_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30412775\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198118452763\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"158187035\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/17\/175cf95b6299220c47f6773213307762a1c8c40d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/17\/175cf95b6299220c47f6773213307762a1c8c40d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/17\/175cf95b6299220c47f6773213307762a1c8c40d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198118452763\/\" data-miniprofile=\"158187035\">L337Dude88<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198118452763\/games\/?tab=all\">96 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198118452763\/recommended\/\">29 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198118452763\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMy review of Betrayer<br><br>Pros: Fantastic setting,  Incredibly immersive and atmospheric,  Beautiful art style, The stories you uncover are very well done and quite tragic,  Firearms are realisticly slow to reload which adds a level of strategy, Good sound design, The wind mechanic is cool.<br><br>Cons: Repetitive,  The world lacks depth,  Combat is fairly bland (Lots of kiting).<br><br>Rating: 7\/10-Good.

In fact, I'm not entirely sure it can even be categorised as a 'game' per se... I shall try to explain. <br><br>You begin shipwrecked on a beach in 1604; all you know is that you sailed from England to join a colony in the Americas. You are met with an eerie, black-and-white landscape, devoid of colour and, apparently, life. You make your way up the beach, and from there you must begin to explore your environment in order to work out where you are, and what has happened here. Things are clearly wrong in this unsettling place. Your only ally is a mysterious woman in red who doesn't know her own name. Your enemies vary from Spanish Conquistadors with demonic red eyes to bow-wielding natives who utter unearthly howls as they stalk you through forests and grasslands; you barely see them coming before they are upon you, attacking and darting away before you can return fire. When you find and ring the fort's bell, the world around you shifts; just when you thought the daylight was scary enough, the night-world is ever more terrifying with skeletons and ghosts to be found all around you, shrieking in the darkness. <br><br>So, scene set, let's start with the basics. The monochromatic graphics are brave and striking; the rendering is gorgeous and you soon get used to looking at this greyscale world, as items of interest are vividly marked in red. But don't be fooled, this doesn't make anything easy to see coming, as realistic wind effects keep the trees and grasses shifting, fooling the eye into seeing movement where there is none, or covering the stealthy approach of a foe. The wind is both your enemy and your ally; you freeze when it blows, for fear that you've seen or heard something moving, or you can dash through the gusts, knowing the sound and movement of the wind will disguise the noise of your approach. <br><br>As if this didn't make things tense enough, sound is extremely important. There is no background music and no vocal acting; all you will hear is the wind, and the sounds around you - some enemies can be detected by the clanking of their armour, distincive howls, or gutteral roars. Early on you gain the ability to listen, using your HUD to follow sounds to be led to clues, locations and lost souls in need of rescue. Ring a bell to enter into the night-world and the sounds are amplified; the dull clanging of the bell, the screaming of wraiths, and having to use your listening ability to pinpoint the next clue... Seriously, play this game at night, alone, with the lights off and no other background noise, and you will discover a whole new level of immersion in this terrifying world. It will probably give you nightmares. And PTSD. Especially if there's a sudden noise in the house while you're immersed... honestly, last night, my cat sneezed while I was creeping up on a heavily-garrisoned fort area, and I had three kinds of heart attack all at once. <br><br>One of the hardest concepts to grasp in this game is that for pretty much all of the time you will not have a single clue what you are supposed to be doing - or even if you are supposed to be doing anything. Think about it - most games you play will have clear cut objectives, quests and story lines to follow. Betrayer doesn't give you any of that, and to be honest, why should it? It's realism at its finest - in real life, a stranger doesn't approach you in the street and tell you that the answer to all you seek is in the next town, here's a map, speak to so-and-so and report back to me so I can tell you what to do next... Betrayer expects you to behave as you might if you really did wash up on a beach in 1604. Figure it out for yourself! Take a walk - look around - collect clues - piece it together - find scraps of paper - talk to the friendly folk - kill the ones that try to kill you - trial and error; you'll get there in the end. Hopefully...<br><br>...Which is why this game gets mixed reviews, it seems. Betrayer will frustrate you as often as it rewards you, because when you're missing a clue and you don't know where to look, then it's hours of map-trawling to try to work out what you've overlooked. There is no handholding here; once you get used to that and start to work things out for yourself you can really start to enjoy it, but this game probably loses a lot of players early on who don't like that style of play. However, the rewards for perseverance are exceptional; intense, involving play; clever use of stealth and strategy; incredible characters and a deeply shocking storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. <br><br>So when I said at the beginning that it can't be characterised as a &quot;game&quot;, it is because of the incredible amount of realism involved, despite the supernatural themes. It is a media form in its own right; a cross between a game, a movie and a real-life action adventure where you have to work everything out for yourself. Betrayer will not even ask you the questions, let alone tell you the answers - you will literally have to suss everything out for yourself. The beautiful thing is that you will be vey pleased with yourself when you do!<br><br>One of my favourite elements of this game was in not knowing where the true evil was; in the deeds of the settlers you learn about, or in the shadowy realm of ghosts and monsters. The irredeemable acts that people do to each other in their own selfish interests and the ways in which those deeds come back to haunt them are intriguing, horrifying and tragic all in one go. <br><br>Betrayer is, essentially, a simple game that can be incredibly difficult at the same time. For example, the combat is apparently straightforward in a point-and-shoot manner, but the nature of the weapons and the environment makes tactics important. Stealth is essential in many cases and reload times for muskets, pistols and crossbows have to be taken into account. You can only carry a realistic amount of ammunition so being able to recover spent arrows from fallen enemies is a nice touch and saves your precious resources. You quickly learn the best weapons to use against each enemy, and there is a grim satisfaction to be had in being able to &quot;stealth kill&quot; an enemy silently from a distance using your trusty longbow (my personal favourite weapon in the game) or by sneaking up and throwing a tomahawk at them. <br> <br>In fact, it is hard to pick fault with Betrayer. Any frustration at not knowing what to do is negated by the fact that it is simply part of the point of the game; you just have to keep searching until you find something that takes you forwards. If you don't like the greyscale graphics, you can adjust the settings of the game so that it is in full colour; personally, I enjoyed the atmospherics much more without any additional colours. If you don't like the eerie silence of the game, you can ruin it with your own background music or something. <br><br>My only real nitpick is that it would have been nice to have some voice acting - if the Lady in Red and other &quot;characters&quot; could talk directly rather than using text boxes, then it would have made the game feel even more realistic. The text boxes were, for me, a jarring interruption to an otherwise flawless experience; even the HUD has been carefully considered to be as unobtrusive as possible, and can be turned off for ultra-realistic feel. <br><br>Otherwise, I thoroughly recommend this game. This is definitely one for those with patience and tenancity who are looking for a real challenge. It is not something to be played through quickly or for light relief. If you invest some real time in working through Betrayer and give it - and yourself - a chance, then you will not be disappointed.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12489852', 'summary' );

an arrow fly's past your head and then the intrigue and mystery start's to kick in.<br>Keep on going and you come to the fort (now to say any more will spoil not only A-your enjoyment but B-all the mystery that await's you)<br>Keep playing and the game show's its mystery and just keeps on giving,i wont say any more as its allway's better in any game to discover it for yourself.<br><br>Blackpowder Games Betrayer Announce Trailer - YouTube <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bKCqIYa8fiA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bKCqIYa8fiA<\/a><br><br>This is one of the best game's on the early access program and deserve's people's time and money but if you would rather wait until the full release who can blame you and let's hope that BLACK POWDER (who listen to all comment's that have been passed on the game and have made improvement's and hopefully will continue to do so in the future until release) can get it finished and release more update's soon as i wait for this game to come out in its entirity with eager anticipation.<br><br>FULL RELEASE REVIEW BELOW (MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOLIER'S)<br><br>Ok so i was waiting the release of the full version of this game and had got my self into quite a fever pitch for its arrival.Am i dissapointed no not in the slightest.The full release contains all the element's that intrigued me in the early access and then expand's on this to the point that it has become so much more than what it allready was.<br>You start of on the beach after the shipwreck (no spoiler's so dont worry) and then proceed from there into a story full of both intrigue and mystery,you wander of up the trail and soon you reach the next area and then the game world expand's and you will be on the way to the first safe haven (WHO AM I KIDDING THERE ARE NO SAFE PLACE'S) Fort Henry and then the game start's to show you its otherwordly side.<br><br>Betrayer - Cleansing the South Gate - YouTube <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QF8iUHH15pg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QF8iUHH15pg<\/a><br><br>Let's just say that the game take's place in both the real and the not so real,but in both you will come across some pretty scary opponent's who need to be felled (in a lot of case's) for you to open up new area's and therefore expand the game world,which therefore open's more challenge's and yet more different (and hard to beat) foe's.<br>The graphic's in game do the job they set out to do perfectly and you often wonder why the world has lost its colour and why certain item's still have their's (mostly item's will have a redish colour to them,but you can mess about and change the setting's so that your world is more colourfull-i wouldent bother though as the game is more striking in black and white and thats how it was meant to be played).<br>The sound in game is (only one word for it) amazing and does its job to perfection,foes will grunt and howl and sometime's you will wonder if its a beast after you or an otherwordly spirit,the much talked about game play element of listening to the wind to adavnce both the story and aid you in quest's has been worked on and now works perfectly (sound was coming from both my speakers and got louder the nearer i got to my objective,also you find that if you heading the wrong way you can tell by the sound coming from your speaker's also).<br>Quest's in game are both entertaining and will advance the story and allway's help uncover that little bit more about what is going on in the world and also why what has happened has &quot;HAPPENED&quot; (and trust me the ending will be one you wont forget in a hurry and will leave you with that &quot;COME ON WHAT'S NEXT&quot; feeling and an urge to play the inevitable sequel).<br><br>SPOILER ALERT*****DONT WATCH IF YOU HAVENT FINISHED THE GAME OR WANT TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF*****SPOILER ALERT<br><br>Betrayer - game ending scenes [spoilers] - YouTube <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ojRyuI2IY8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ojRyuI2IY8<\/a><br><br>The gameplay element that i most liked in the early access release was the &quot;PERMA DEATH&quot; one,when it came to dying and getting your money back you had just one chance to do so,its still in the full release but after a patch you can now set this so that you can get your money back from where you fell no end of time's not just one,but also the game can now be set so that the enemies are easier to fell (i will not be using this function as i enjoy the game the way it is,but its there if you find the game to hard and want to just enjoy the story and the game world).<br>In closing will you enjoy the full release now its here,well if you enjoy a game that is full of intrigue and mystery then YES,if that doesnt sound like you and you dont like these sort of game's then avoid it and buy something else,but do i reccomend it now its out in its entirity &quot;HELL YES I DO&quot;<br><br>(JUST TO ADD 5 HOUR'S OF OVERALL PLAY TIME WAS IN EARLY ACCESS RELEASE VERSION)<br><br>(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEO'S PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNER'S AND ARE THEIR'S BY COPYRIGHT)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8761668', 'summary' );

Fine.<br><br>You end up shipwrecked on a beach in Virginia in 1604, as you get up and proceed to work your way to the colonies and small settlements you realized everyone is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing gone except for a girl with a red hood, and Spaniards. And form there you must unravel what happened to the colony and everyone in it, that's the story right there. <br><br>The game is classified as horror, and this appears as you unravel the story, the history, and even in the enemies. I'm telling you right now that when you think you've seen it all, the game pulls another punch that catches you offguard. You'll also find that the game is split between two worlds.<br><br>Gameplay.<br><br>Gameplay is fantastic, it's a mix between Dark Souls and STALKER. Everything virtually takes away 50% of your health, you drink water to restore your health and can carry two charges of water with you to use, and it gets tougher as the game goes along. If you die you drop all your loot in that area, it disappears if you die before picking it up. You can change it to easy mode though but why would you do that? <br>Moving around the map is also pretty damn nice, as you can run for as long as you want, no sprint bar or anything, and fast travel is an option, making traversing a breeze. Combatwise you don't get anything, you only get a knife for melee and that's it, you can stealth kill with it and you can upgrade the damage it does. Weaponry includes musket's (pistol and rifle), bows (short and long), and a crossbow, there are unique versions of it which overhaul how you fight, and the bows are silent for stealth killing, you also get a tomahawk, which you throw, also silent, it oneshots nearly everything.<br><br>As you go through the game you will find pages which explain more of the history, and areas that are buried, these hold clues for your investigation jobs, and items. Speaking of which, your investigations play a vital role in the game, seeing as how no one cane be talked to in the light world, they happen dynamically, as you find items or otherwise. They really help toward the end game as well as open up the history more. <br><br>Moving on from that, we move to various tidbits, you can buy and sell, and you don't need to be at a merchant station to sell, you can sell from your inventory, pretty convenient. You also can retrieve arrows, ammo, and tomahawks off of killed enemies, as well as various loot items. And speaking of loot items, there are chests everywhere, and some hold upgrades to items, these include and extra tomahawk, and charms.<br><br>And charms are the next part, charms are those items you apply for various additions to what you have. These include the ability to be harder to see, faster reload, and more health. The charms and weapons all come in various qualities, from crude to exceptional, there's also unique weaponry, which upgrades on a different scale. You can carry three charms, and three weapons, and all weapons are tied to hotkeys and of course, the scroll wheel. Oh, and I forgot to mention, you do get set amounts of ammo, such as 10 arrows, but your ammo count is also upgradable, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in' A!<br><br>There are also bells in every section of the map, that lead to the Otherworld\/Bell World\/Purgatory. This is also a major area in where the horror manifests, as well as a whole different map to explore for loot, enemies, and the story of course! It's shrouded in fog and everything else you saw in the video on the store page. It's fun! You can also hit X for help, no waymarkers are used, despite having a compass, and hitting X will give you some creepy audio which leads you to clues and objectives, it can't be used constantly though, mashing X won't give you a stream of the audio; it &quot;recharges&quot; after use which takes a few seconds.<br><br>There is a toggle button which does give you a subtle waymarker on the compass to help you.<br><br>Stealth.<br><br>Stealth is one of the biggest aspects of this game, occassionally in the overworld the grass rustles, this lets you run through it for the duration without alerting anyone, and running will bring attention, as will firing any gun. You can crouch, which hides you, and get close to enemies to shank them, or hit them with a tomahawk. An important note to take is that wind does not affect arrows or bullets, so feel free not to worry if you are aiming and the wind suddenly blows.<br><br>Enemies.<br><br>Oh boy this is fun!<br><br>I'm only gonna reveal two, because I can and the enemies are really something to see.<br><br>Spaniards: One thing you'll notice fast is that the Spaniards dotted around the map are not quite humanly, these are your standard enemy, and they stop at nothing to kill you, they come in numbers, and force. They will be armed with bows, muskets of both kinds, and they tend to run up and stab\/punch you in your face. Remember! You can't take too many hits, so even four of them will require some kind of planning. Worry not though, as the game does not penalize you for choosing one combat type over the other, but running in guns blazing is still a risky move.<br><br>Skeletons: The common everyday grunt of fantasy games returns and wants you dead! The skeletons are not push overs, every bit as strong as the Spaniards, but at least five different kinds of lethal. Unlike the Spaniards they are mostly melee oriented, but a good number of them will attack at range, and seeing as how they don't have guns or bows, they fire energy blasts at you at a rapid rate, did I mention they also have good aiming? Also unlike the Spaniards, they pop up at random around the Otherworld, some may pop up no more than a few feet from you. Spooked solid? You \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in' bet.<br><br>Non-enemies.<br><br>Wraiths, Shadows, The Red Hooded Maiden.<br><br>Wraiths and Shadows are there to tell a story, don't expect too much from them. They are the people to talk to do everything investigation related, don't expect them to be fully fleshed out, however their own histories are pretty interesting. Shadows however are there to tell a story like the Wraithes and give you sidequests and rewards. Both Wraithes and Shadows really really add to the horror factor, and the Wraithes especially make it seem like it's some kind of purgatory where they are. The Red Hooded Maiden is the person you'll be in constant contact with, she's the only person to talk to in the light world, not much more to say but to experience it for yourself, sorry for \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665tting my way out!<br><br>Tid-bits.<br><br>The game is in an entirely black an white color scheme, punctuated with shades of red. This adds to the horror, and the red shows you something is not right with the world. You can change the color contrast, but why would you do that also? I do recommend playing through it the first time on black and white, it was the dev's artistic vision and it really makes the game. There's also no music, relying on ambient and various sounds, some superb audio if I ever heard any.<br><br>The game also throws punches in terms of difficulty, as you do progress your weapons do let you deal with the enemies more smoothly, but as you get better so do they, as new enemies appear and as they get more agressive in numbers and to ane extent, power. Did I mention arrows have a chance of deflecting off armor?<br><br>There is one problem, and that is a bug that makes you crash to the desktop. This is the only bug and it happens by accessing the menu and just rapidly moving through things. It's not the worst, but it does break the immersion when it happens; tread carefully around that. The game also saves often, so no worries if it does crash.<br><br>Overall, Betrayer is an unsettling game, that gets better as you progress, it doesn't get over complicated or lost in telling the story, the combat remains challenging and grows as you go along. The total game time is at least 8-10 hours, not bad for an indie game.<br><br>I give this game 4 out of 5 Axes!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9638842', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9638842' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9638842\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9638842' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9638842\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9638842', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9638842_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9638842_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t107 of 119 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12380720\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meat_bug\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"61719574\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18b831826ed490cbf2a35094209dafdb6d1349a7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18b831826ed490cbf2a35094209dafdb6d1349a7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18b831826ed490cbf2a35094209dafdb6d1349a7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meat_bug\/\" data-miniprofile=\"61719574\">Meatbug<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meat_bug\/games\/?tab=all\">611 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meat_bug\/recommended\/\">46 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meat_bug\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBetrayer is a first-person game, where you awake on a small beach after your ship wrecked. <br>You are thrown into the game, without any explanation or a real goal first, so you'll start exploring.<br><br>Controls are basically like any other first-person game. you can jump, crouch, use your weapons and interact with objects.<br>So, until here, everything is quite the usual.<br><br>What makes it so interesting and unique in my opinion, is the visuals. <br>Yes, having a game being black and white and only highlight enemies and objects with the color red was a great move. It adds a lot(!) to the atmosphere (you can however play with the contrast, and color saturation yourself to make it  colorful again, though i wouldn't recommend it).<br><br>After you have made your first steps, you encounter quite mysterious happenings.<br>Enemies appear and will try to shoot you on sight, but they don't seem particularly human. <br>After finding and entering your first settlement, you'll find burned corpses and try to find out what happened to these poor souls and then, there is also that mysterious maiden in red, which appears out of nowhere and then there is also, what i would call, the &quot;ghost realm&quot; (after ringing a bell in a settlement, everything darkens and you'll end up fighting skeletons and talking to souls, which got murdered).<br><br>Together with the visuals, the great sound and the spooky atmosphere it makes a quite good game.<br>The world itself is divided into larger hubs, where you can roam and explore freely, though, there isn't that much to find (graves, some clues and diary-entries which will give you a bit of backstory and few settlements or smaller places of interest).<br>You will find (or buy) different weapons throughout the game, like bows, crossbows, pistols and muskets to fight of the enemies (which you should do stealthy in most cases, as you can't take much damage).<br><br>The middle part feels a bit stretched and sometimes, it can be a bit frustrating, not knowing exactly what to do and where to go, but if you like exploring and a rather stealthy first-person mystery game which doesn't take you by the hand, then i would definitely recommend this one!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12380720', 'summary' );

It was a breath of fresh air from the usual mundane FPS games out there.<br><br>The atmosphere, gameplay, and narrative, were all spot on. You can tell this was made by a passionate group of developers who wanted to make a game different from the rest.<br><br>Mystery and suspense are the key areas of focus when it comes to the story. You're continuously driven to explore and uncover more about the events that unfolded in one of the first New World colonies. It's a very interesting time period\/setting, and the feeling of isolation and terror are captured very well.<br><br>Gameplay evolves as you progress through the game. Stealth takes a bit of practice to master and becomes more necessary as the enemies become more difficult to fight. Each area has &quot;crime scenes&quot; that let you piece together what happened to figure out what to do next. It's deeply satisfying to find all the clues and work out where to go next. The game doesn't try to do too much too quickly, but rather presents itself gradually and expects you to keep up. Very nice stuff.<br><br>I couldn't recommend Betrayer more. It's everything I personally look for in a game, but still managed to surprise me. I can't wait for the next game from Blackpowder Games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19542436', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19542436' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19542436\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19542436' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19542436\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19542436', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19542436_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19542436_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t77 of 79 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15815876\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10458486\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f801062e688000a20d9a7d86ec119da75bc9c7dd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10458486\">Auburok<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/games\/?tab=all\">670 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/recommended\/\">75 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Auburok\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI didn't know what to expect when I began Betrayer, but it was pretty good. While it's definitely focused on first person combat using bows and 17th century firearms, there's a large focus on exploration and figuring out what happened. It's straight forward and linear, as horror stories tend to be, but good, nontheless. One of the major draws is the desaturated graphics, which are adjustable from fully desaturated aside from red, and full saturation. You can adjust these as you please, which is pretty cool, although I will admit it's easier to pick out items and enemies when it's played in its default state (and it actually brings a horror aspect to bright daylight areas).<br><br>You go from map to map piecing together what happened, along with collecting weapons, charms, ammo and cash. There's a sneak mechanic to the game which works well, and isn't finicky. There's a melee attack, but aside from charms there's no variation there. Bows and tomahawks are reusable but not as strong as firearms initially, so a lot of the first half of the game you'll be balancing what weapons to use, etc. The maps are of a medium size aside from the tutorial map, and there's even fast travel and &quot;return to last location&quot; so you can hop back to town to pick up some stuff and go right back to where you were, which is nice and leads to more engaging gameplay over endless walking.<br><br>The game is about 8 or so hours long if you do everything, probably 10-12 if you go for all the achievements. The story is interesting though it'll require a lot of reading. It's definitely a more subtle kind of horror, which I think works a little better in the long run for a game like this. I'd say at $20, this is a decent buy, but I got it for $4 which is a huge steal for this.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15815876', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15815876' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15815876\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15815876' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15815876\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15815876', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15815876_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15815876_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t99 of 116 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12808129\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">62.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou begin Betrayer washed up on the shore of the New World, a country rendered in stark monochrome. A linear path leads you inland, acting as a tutorial along the way, but it's once you reach the abandoned Fort Henry that you really begin to grasp what awaits you.Or rather, you don't. Betrayer is the sort of game that delights in keeping you on the edge, never entirely sure what's happened to rid the land of human life or what you're supposed to do about it. It's a game with no missions, no quest markers, no breadcrumb trails. Blackpowder Games, largely made up of former Monolith developers, has dipped into some obvious influences for this stark and striking horror adventure. The Elder Scrolls is one, with an open map through which you navigate by icons on the compass. You'll also sense strong echoes of Far Cry 3. Corrupted, animalistic Conquistadors patrol the wilderness, and since your only defences are crude bows, old-fashioned muskets and a throwing tomahawk, you'll spend a lot of time skulking through long grass, masking your movements in time with gusts of wind and thinning their numbers as stealthily as possible.Should you fall in battle - and you will, since these Conquistadors hit hard and are relentless once they have your scent - you'll respawn back at the fort, leaving all the valuables you found at the site of your death. If you die again before reclaiming them, whatever you found or earned is gone forever.But Betrayer is also an adventure game, of sorts, and one that is driven by mystery and puzzles. Not the crude block-sliding, lever-pulling puzzles that games so often fall back on, but deeper, more abstract problems. In terms of tone and mood it reminds me, more than anything, of the hallucinatory and terrifying climax of 2009 metaphysical viking movie, Valhalla Rising. It's a game that presents exploration as cloying terror and colonisation as a creeping cancer. It's scary, not in the cheap sense, but at a more primal level. You're compelled to explore this land - area by area - but it never feels comfortable or empowering.While Betrayer succeeds in atmosphere, it fares less well in pure gameplay terms. The lack of direction is thrilling, but becomes problematic when the game only marks specific locations on the map.Combat is, sadly, where the game is weakest. The enemies are fairly crude creations, wandering back and forth in fixed, meaningless patterns, and their AI doesn't stretch much further than simply charging at you once roused.Once you've got their attention, they'll follow you across the whole map, displaying only the most rudimentary of tactics - at a distance, they'll use ranged attacks, and up close they'll batter you senseless. Betrayer is rougher around the edges than its stylish exterior may suggest, but it's never less than fascinating.The whole game is a question, intriguingly posed and offering no easy answers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12808129', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12808129' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12808129\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12808129' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12808129\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12808129', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12808129_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12808129_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t204 of 271 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">14 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>15 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15362078\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"122384121\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/52ff3188dc7ad80e0d738a645d0ec1c6d87f384c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/52ff3188dc7ad80e0d738a645d0ec1c6d87f384c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/52ff3188dc7ad80e0d738a645d0ec1c6d87f384c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"122384121\">\ud83d\udc7e \ud83c\udd7c \ud83c\udd70\u274e\u30c4<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/games\/?tab=all\">2,441 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/recommended\/\">127 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MaximumPlayer\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 14, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">First thing after starting the game was setting up the saturation level to make the colors appear. Then, suddenly the game looks much better! The atmosphere in Betrayer is quite mysterious and induce you to explore the &quot;New World&quot;. Environment looks good. Trees, leaves and grass moves with the wind naturally. One thing that I miss are the animals, you hear them but, do not see. The story is about helping the lost souls to find their peace. To navigate through the world you can use special ability to hear. Actually there are two dimensions, the light world and the dark one which you are switching by ringing the bell. Shooting is more about timing and accuracy. 17th century guns reload very slow so missing a shot is a mistake you will regret so badly that it will make you cry... just kidding. Betrayer is quite unique so it's worth a try!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15362078', 'summary' );

That being said, I never really heard much about Betrayer and think it far exceeded my expectations. You can play this in black and white, or turn the color saturation to max and let the visuals really shine. I thought some parts got to be very repetitive, but solving some of the mysterys really kept me pushing through it. Each zone you get to seemed to present a new enemy. I really enjoyed the combat and thought it gave you plenty of options. Like others have stated, the ending was a bit strange and definitely leaves you asking some questions. So if you're on the fence about it, pick it up when it's on sale. This game should not be overlooked and I wish I had heard more about it before I started playing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30780052', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30780052' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30780052\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30780052' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30780052\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30780052', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30780052_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30780052_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30772581\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Poirot633\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"30512259\">Poirot<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all, the graphics and the atmosphere of this game are fantastic. The major problems come in when you realise the world is quite empty, and there is no real use to being stealthy, since enemy encounters are so far and few, and they are basically random ambushes which you cannot really avoid. The story is also not so compelling and the combat system is not very sophisticated, although still quite enjoyable. Overall this was a great experience. This game has some flaws, but for its price I still recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30772581', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30772581' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30772581\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30772581' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30772581\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30772581', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30772581_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30772581_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30716113\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/yurgon\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"21382983\">Yurgon<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPicked it up in a sale a while back and just recently discovered this gem in my library.<br><br>I like the art style and how the game slowly introduces its mechanics.

You will find some chests which you could loot to get some money. A stranger will shoot an arrow with a message into a tiki totem and tells you to escape before it is too late. Obviously you won't do this and keep exploring around. Objects or other interactings will give a nice indicator or a sign that you can do actions with them. Like a piece of paper has an obvious different color and is shining from a distance. When getting chased by an enemy or an enemy has spotted you, A heart beat sound will keep ticking and it will stop whenever you &quot;safe&quot;.<br><br>There are auto-saves available.<br>There is a shop stall to buy new things.<br>You are able to change the color settings at all times.<br>You are able to change the difficulty settings in-game.<br>Health\/ammo indicator font is pretty small.<br>Graphics are okay.<br>Scenery is okay but could be bland\/stale at times.<br>Terrain effect is nicely done.<br>Game feels short and it has a story.<br>Doesn't have alot of enemies.<br>Collectables\/Interactings have a good visible indicator. They also make a sound when you are close to them.<br>There is a map available and you can fast travel to some locations after you have discovered them.<br>The map is also showing all locations of each collectable and which kind of collectable.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Other things.<\/div><br>The game is nice, but on the same time The game feels boring as well. There are not alot of enemies around the world and i have the feeling this game is more story\/explore based than fighting.

I can\u2019t believe that some people complained enough to get a standard color version added to the game [later].  It\u2019s a shame that they can\u2019t appreciate the artistic vision that the design team had.<br><br>The game relies on sound, as there are mechanics associated with exploring each area and also for stealth combat.  There is no music which makes the sounds of the wind, birds and enemies enjoyably pure.<br><br>The item system is simple, but ramps up appropriately until the end.  There was never a point where I felt particularly flooded or starved for ammo.<br><br>Combat is of a straight forward, first-person style with weapons and items appropriate for the time period.  Stealth is a reliably useful ability that punishes people who run headlong into battle.<br><br>Finally the story\u2026 despairing, brutally violent, suspenseful.<br><br>I strongly recommend this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30605593', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30605593' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30605593\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30605593' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30605593\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30605593', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30605593_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30605593_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30604291\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xetrocoen\/recommended\/243120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"257871963\">\u221a\u03c0<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t!!
