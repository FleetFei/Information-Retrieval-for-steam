This is incredibly apparent playing through AlphaNuts premiere Steam title, it truly feels like a love letter to a generation where RPGs really found their stride. The aim was clearly to make a game the developers would love to play and to incorporate everything from the genre that makes it special. They succeed very well at the replication, only it comes with a few warts and tropes included.<br><br>You begin your adventure by joining your hero Seil and his companion in the middle of a heist gone wrong. It's a welcome break from inhabiting an unassuming young adult, moments before his village is burned to the ground and vows revenge against the nefarious empire. That's not to say you won't recognise a lot of traditional set-ups from JRPGs, anime and manga but it's refreshing enough in a typically conventional genre that you'll let a few stereotypes pass. It helps that the characters are quite interesting, with emotional brooding teenagers replaced by charismatic and cheerful swindlers. It's a small scale tale, taking place in a single city but its inhabitants are both memorable and likeable.<br><br>The game is broken down into small chunks and presented in an almost episodic fashion. It's a pleasantly unusual change to the formula that enables the current segment of the story to be wrapped up at the end of each chapter while keeping an arching storyline to maintain interest throughout. In all honesty, you could quite easily ignore the unconventional segmentation and play it as a standard JRPG but it does help structure the story and offer easy points at which to save and take a break. I think we've all stopped playing a game only to come back to it a few weeks later and been completely lost to the events upon resuming.<br><br>What really sets Sacred Tears apart is also its strongest factor; the combat system. It's difficult to describe efficiently but the strange alchemy of poker, rock-paper-scissors and Play Your Cards Right works remarkably well. You draw a hand of nine cards, each with their own combat options and a value, and your opponent is given a similar selection. You pick three each turn and they're paired off against the enemy's, with certain actions being stronger against others and the numbers deciding the final outcome. There are more subtle nuances such as potential hints towards the cards they've chosen and bluffs but the basics alone are enough to appreciate the labour that went into making an interesting and original system.<br><br>It takes some time to settle into the mechanics comfortably enough to become confident, and while the tutorials are efficient in teaching you the very basics of the structure, there could be a little more in the way advanced hints and thorough descriptions. Personally, I appreciate the lack of hand-holding, but it's a divisive subject and there will be a few that will want to check the PDF manual for tips to the tougher battles. There's a large element of luck to the combat which is bound to frustrate some, but it's difficult to see how guaranteed rules could be implemented without becoming effortless. I hugely recommend trying the demo before purchasing to see which side of the fence you sit. Fortunately, one other contentious facet of JRPGs is largely eliminated and that is grinding. You'll find the best means with which to increase your odds of success are within your own skills and methods rather than spending mindless hours trying to reach some arbitrary stat level.<br><br>Genoseed City is a beautiful place, rendered lovingly in pixelated prettiness. It could easily stand besides the games it replicates by creating faux-authentic hardware limits while simultaneously using those constraints to perfect a design close to many gamer's hearts. Knowing that a game was made in RPGMaker typically puts me off, but the signs are much less apparent in this case. There's a clear amount of effort put into creating unique menus, sprites and environments so its origin does little to dissuade me. It's also got a pretty great soundtrack that's catchy at times and dramatic when it needs to be. It's not one I think I'd listen to outside of gaming; like Persona, Final Fantasy 8 or Disgaea, but it's far superior to the typical JRPG on Steam.<br><br>There are some issues that became apparent over extended play, with my biggest gripe being the lack of options. As in, there's no menu whatsoever. Control adjustments, resolution changes, sound levels and more are unavailable, at least through traditional means, and it's a shame that such an obvious omission mars a pretty great whole product. The gameplay begins to flag in the latter third of the game slightly, with the greatness displayed in the first two thirds never really being expanded upon. It doesn't derail an enjoyable and very charming JRPG in any real sense though, but it's something I'd love to see worked on if, fingers crossed, a sequel is ever in the works.<br><br>My complaints mostly come from love, of wanting the game to achieve the heights its potential could have reached. Despite these hiccups, it's still one of my favourite JRPGs on Steam and that's not without lack of competition. At \u00a36.99 you get huge value for money, with a 15+ hour adventure full of smart combat, an enjoyable story with plenty of character development and a hugely charming, beautiful design. It's fantastic to see developers that very clearly respect their players and enjoy playing their games as much as making them. I'm all the more excited to see where they go from here.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15832089', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15832089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15832089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15832089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15832089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15832089', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15832089_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15832089_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12251703\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MelficeOne\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"80012706\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18cfaabfd4cad116c122f27582af8d07734ff029.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18cfaabfd4cad116c122f27582af8d07734ff029.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18cfaabfd4cad116c122f27582af8d07734ff029_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MelficeOne\/\" data-miniprofile=\"80012706\">MelficeOne<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MelficeOne\/games\/?tab=all\">1,714 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MelficeOne\/recommended\/\">51 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MelficeOne\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 26, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBy now, its cute. Altho the &quot;8 chapters&quot; may be misleading at the start. Since every chapter is pretty short by itself, usually just one mission.<br><br>Now, the actual reviewing starts. I havent played into it too much, I am just 3 chapters in, but that was already enough to see some core gameplay.<br><br>lets start up with the battle system - The card based system may seem a bit complicated at the start, but in the end - its not. Cards have 5 Levels - 1,2,3,4 and S - and 5 actions - Attack, Special, Block, Dodge and Magic. you draw a hand of 8 and pick 3 of them. higher card does its action and when its a standoff there is a rock paper scissors system to determin who gets a hit in. Strategy comes in when you take enemy Prediction into account, meaning the color of their cards. but theres a guy right at the start explaining you all that.<br>And even tho it seems ovrwhelming at the beginning, it flows from your hand after 2 or 3 fights.<br><br>now to the art style - the FaceArt is pretty well made, the Intro and Chapter End Pictures all have a nice feel and good handdrawn style to them. the world is pretty colorful, altho sometimes a little overwhelming (more later). The character models themselves seem to bee pretty SD style, means they are more head than anything else.<br><br>Music - from what I could experience, the usic is good. Battle music gets one pumped and the town has that nice quiet peaceful feeling.<br><br>but I cand give all good things. some negative stuff that sprung to me.<br><br>first of all, You are playing a thief whose dayjob is to be a Private Investigator... best part - he goes thieving without any different outfit. He is out there in the same gear he can be seen through the day. then in the 3rd chapter someone actually comes into your office, having a job fr your thief Alter Ego...

Thankfully, it doesn't seem to use any of the presets, for the character sprites (though I admit I don't really favor it that much), portraits, tile sets, down to the very menu itself, unlike many RPG maker games on Steam. Moreover, there are several CGs that are well drawn between each chapter and some boss fights, though a bit rough, but consistent. The music sounds like most JRPGs, but it's still of good quality, and doesn't feel the least bit annoying.<br><br>The game's description is pretty accurate, so do take a look at it if you're interested. The game is put into an episodic format, with 24 chapters for the main story and 24 chapters of side quests (although the first one is just a free play chapter to explore around the town). Each chapter lasts as long as a couple minutes to well, under an hour, depending on how much you explore\/grind\/etc.<br><br>The plot pretty much consists of Seil, a low-rank, wannabe thief, along with his childhood friend Seana, doing various of jobs through their daily lives (time progression is notable, actually, if you pay attention to the tree colors in the outskirts). Ultimately, Seil seeks to steal the ultimate treasure of the empire, the Sacred Tear; it's a dream of every thief in Genoseed. A more &quot;dramatic&quot; plot does slowly unveil as the chapters go on, but it's nothing really memorable. I didn't really like that the background story of the Genoseed\/the Empire\/Holy Church kind of isn't extremely clear. You'll pick up some as the missions go along and talking with NPCs, but through most of the game I was kind of unsure what to think of them.<br><br>But somehow, the character development makes up for that. Each character is rich with personality, especially Seil, a hot-headed, often reckless kid (who the other characters kind of often poke fun at), and Seana, who is the more mature of the two, but easily provoked, especially by Seil. The dialogue is fairly light-hearted for the most part (and expect a good amount of it --it's an RPG), and overall it made the game a fairly relaxing experience.<br><br>Like someone else said, much of the game consists of running around, but as someone who actually hates exploring in RPGs (shoot me), I didn't mind it. There is a good number of &quot;hidden&quot; items you may want to pick up, whether to craft items, sell for fil ( the game's currency), or to improve the level of your characters skills.  Besides, you can dash with Z (oh and if the dash bar\/chapter name on the screen bothers you, you can press shift to make it go away or move it to another arrangement), so it cuts down a lot of the time. You'll pass by most of the items in each chapter on the way doing most of the storyline work. Plus the area of exploration is pretty small. It's called a &quot;City Adventure&quot; for a reason. There's one central area, with different sectors of the down, along with a suburb, and the town outskirts. It's difficult to get lost, and they do clearly tell you where you need to go. <br><br>Now for the battle system itself, I admit that the tutorial kind of misses out on a lot of information. The manual does help with it though, especially explaining the stats, with things like Seana's &quot;judge&quot; wasn't exactly clear (it's her judgement of what type of magic to cast, whether that's fire, frost, spark, ATK up, DEF up, or Healing) or Seil's &quot;evade&quot; stat, which the tutorial called &quot;agility&quot; (it's how accurate Seil can predict the enemy's cards\/moves). If you do mess up though, you can redistribute stats any time during the game (on the field) by going to the menu ~&gt; status screen. I also found it helpful to change it around during different boss battles, especially if you have difficulty beating the boss.<br><br>There are only like five kinds of normal enemies though, but they are just recolored over the chapters, getting harder (a cat, slime, dog, a trio of bats, and soliders...well six if you count gangsters (but they forever look the same)). Along with some secret field bosses (that drop acessories) and other general storyline bosses.<br><br>Although some didn't feel like the card system had depth. I felt differently. The card system lays out 9 different cards at a time for you. They will range in numbers from 1 to 4 (and sometimes... &quot;S&quot; or &quot;5&quot; I can't tell, but the number is in gold). You can choose three of them in certain order. The enemy will choose 3 as well. Now, there are 5 different type of cards: attack, special attack, dodge, defend, and magic (which is what Seana is for, who stays in the back with no HP bar of her own). The cards with the highest value wins, but in the case of ties, certain cards will beat others or have a tie. For example, a 4 attack card will counter out any special or magic attack, but will lose against dodges or blocks (in which the opponent can use a counter attack if it's...two successful ones in a row I think? I might be wrong). <br><br>The game tends to hint what cards the enemy will be using. Green typically means a defend or dodge. Blue typically means an attack. Red typically means a strong attack. A red &quot;CAUTION&quot; means that one of those cards are of a 4 value (but it's any type of card). But this isn't always. The higher your evade stat, the more accurate the predictions are. It won't ever be perfect though. An enemy can &quot;bluff&quot;. So what's the point of strategy then? Well, as you use up cards you will recieve new cards of new values, and if you use your highest values first, you're more than likely going to wind up with card values of 1\/2. Now, if you know the enemy is probably not even going to attack this turn, you can use rid of those cards (sometimes nothing can happen, like if you're both on the defensive), though be wary if they're a type of attack card (not including magic) as it can result in a counter attack. Of course, this doesn't mean that a high attack value card isn't hiding in there either. You can also do this if you feel that you can take another blow this turn. Though I will say that sometimes a fairy can come and increase a random card value by one, or switch one or more cards with a new one.  And sometimes a 1 value attack card will turn into a red 4 attack card, which I think just happens by chance. Yes, luck does apply in this game, but in a turn-based game, when doesn't it? <br><br>There are potions (each health 50% HP) in this game that can be used at the start of any turn with shift. You will gain potions periodically, for a reason I haven't quite figured out. It might be turns or some other condition during battle. Max is 10, though you can trade 10 potions for a kit that you can use to provide yourself with more potions when you run out. There are also auto revivals you can craft or buy, although hard to craft or somewhat pricy. There are other items you can craft to help aid you in battle, though I haven't quite bothered.<br><br>Oh, and if you're really lazy to even think during battle, like during a boss battle. You can give Seil a fair amount of HP, no additional attack, no evade, and really high defense. Then give Seana high magic attack, and low judgement. This way the enemy only can really hit you 1~5, even with hard hitting special attacks. The only way you can attack though in this method is by Seana's magic attack. Though if she keeps using buffs instead of attacks, well...it takes forever.<br><br>TL;DR I recommend this game as it's a solid RPG. The character development is great, the dialogue can be amusing, and overall it's a fairly relaxing experience. I don't feel pressured to grind or explore aimlessly (oh yeah, there's no random battles). I personally find the battle system to be pretty refreshing. But if you're still unsure if you want this game, there's a demo you can download on their homepage.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13383809', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13383809' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13383809\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13383809' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13383809\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13383809', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13383809_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13383809_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12360947\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"40613203\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/feb350f651799cf79593f6a3434b9fc6f7653be3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/feb350f651799cf79593f6a3434b9fc6f7653be3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/feb350f651799cf79593f6a3434b9fc6f7653be3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40613203\">dragon_blade<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/games\/?tab=all\">675 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/recommended\/\">47 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mack123123123\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWell i am at a point now where i think i can review this.  Yes this is an rpgmaker game but it is different from 99.9% of them. It has it's own menu (not that crap pre made one) i am pretty sure it has it's own music which is not bad. <br><br>The battle system is unique which is rare for a game made on rpgm If i am not mitaken this uses the vx version  ?  Anyhow to the point it uses a card \/ luck based system You have you defend cards attack cards spell card and you evasion cards. So how this battle systems works is like this. <br><br>enemy                                                           you <br>2 defend  3 attack 2 attack                          3 attack 4 magic 3 defend <br><br>Each card has a value up to 5  (1,2,3,4,S=5)   The set up i have above me will work like this <br><br>On the first turn since i have 3 attack his 2 defend will do nothing. Other then reduce the damage. On the next turn i have 4 magic and he has 3 attack  magic is casted at random so sometimes you will get a buff spell or and attack or healing spell. Let's say we get an atack spell. we would basically negate his attack. (i think)   now he has 2 attack and i have 3 defend his attack would do nothing. <br><br>there is a way to tell which card is which but that is explained in game. you can change the colour of you cards to try and fool the other player\/monster  so there is a bit a thinking involved.  being a different rpgm game i would have to say give this a go it will not be for everyone. <br><br>there are stats involved attack defense evasion ect when you level up you gain a point and you can choose which stats to increase. <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12360947', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12360947' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12360947\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12360947' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12360947\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12360947', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12360947_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12360947_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12473464\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059732162\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"99466434\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a9202a1324c5c47a1477c2acffb98b76574cf9b1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a9202a1324c5c47a1477c2acffb98b76574cf9b1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a9202a1324c5c47a1477c2acffb98b76574cf9b1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059732162\/\" data-miniprofile=\"99466434\">Setsuei<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059732162\/games\/?tab=all\">175 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059732162\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198059732162\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 12, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs of this moment Im about 70% done with both the main story and side missions.<br><br>Story - Not anything major, it has one but ultimately it's just chapter after chapter of what happens in the daily lives of the main characters. Personally I prefer this, as the characters in general are quite entertaining and they have a nice chemistry with one another. You play the role of Seil, a dude who wants to be a major thief, along side him is his child hood friend Seana.<br><br>Gameplay - I find that this game have relatively great gameplay for an rpgmaker title. You steal, your craft to some degree and you sell items. On your journey, you have quite a few problems to solve, and usually you can solve them in more than 1 way, usually the more in your face way will be less thief like and or cost you money. The battle system is what I consider the most important element next to characters in an rpg. It's a RPS turn based system with a bit of luck involved. It mostly consists of 5 actions:<br><br>Strong Attack - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with attack and magic if they're of the same level.<br>Attack - loses to dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.<br>Magic - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and attack if they're of the same level.<br>Defend - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.<br>Dodge - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.<br><br>The highest level card will always win, an example would be despite the fact that Strong attack beats dodge if they're the same level, if you attack with a level 2 strong attack amd the opponent happens to be using a level 3 dodge, the dodge will trump the strong attack. Looking at the strength and weaknesses above, you're probably thinking you should only use strong attacks or magic every chance you get. Well, you can't. This is where some of the &quot;Luck&quot; part of the game comes into play. In order to do any of the above actions, you must have the corresponding card to do so. When the fight begins you are assigned a total of 9 cards, these cards comes in varying levels of 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each turn you must use any 3 cards. When the next turn comes around you will automatically draw 3 new cards. <br><br>The enemies you fight are limited to only using Strong Attacks, Attack, Defend and Dodge. The cards are color coded so you can guess about 80% of the time what enemy is gonna do, but you have little way of knowing the level of their action. Sometimes the enemy will try to bluff you, making you think a card they're using is a particular card, when in fact it's not. This doesnt happen too often, and your chances of prediction increases with Seil's agility parameter. <br><br>Sound - Pretty good, sfx in fights sounds about right. The music is great imo.<br><br>Replay Value - I don't feel there's much if at all any, it's relatively impossible to miss a side event unless you wished to. However the game seems relatively long, I've only put 22 hours into the game and I feel confident that the game will last at least another 10-12 hours.<br><br>Tldr? Buy it. It's a great rpg for $10 with lovable characters and a fun battle system.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12473464', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12473464' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12473464\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12473464' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12473464\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12473464', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12473464_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12473464_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12285489\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"20386982\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6c015b1ad53e7e7b6eae76e12e8016e38ae5030b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6c015b1ad53e7e7b6eae76e12e8016e38ae5030b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6c\/6c015b1ad53e7e7b6eae76e12e8016e38ae5030b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/\" data-miniprofile=\"20386982\">Anonymous of Washington<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/games\/?tab=all\">392 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/recommended\/\">34 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/youalwayswereakiddersteve\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 28, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMy final impression of this as &quot;FIN&quot; appeared on my screen was that it's &quot;Squandered Potential: The Game&quot;, and after thinking some more on it I still think that's the case. Whatever it had going for it in the first 10 hours doesn't build up to anything greater, and in the long run that obviously hurts the game.<br><br>The card-based fighting system is fresh but without much depth, and as such it can't support the game in it's final stages. It was nice to have a system that was more about managing risk than exploiting the enemies weaknesses though. There's a demo out for this game so rather than talk about it if you're interested just go try it out.<br><br>The plot feels like it ends up going nowhere and probably 3\/4ths of it is everyday character interactions, which isn't that bad but after spending so much time with these characters (23 hrs + some missed content) I just wished there was a more compelling \/ interesting plot. If i had to compare it to something it's like a slice of life JRPG, if that sounds interesting to you then by all means pick this up.<br><br>Another thing that got to me was that the playable map was incredibly small, essentially it's just the one town and a handful of dungeons. This game has 20+ hours of content with 24 main missions and 24 side ones. The problem with this is that quite a number of these missions involve you running around the town talking to every NPC you see in order to advance said missions, which gets old fast. There are a few missions which take you &quot;out&quot; of the main town but it's just a scene cut into whatever building the plot requires you to be in. If the devs could have worked in another town or two, expanded on the plot a bit, and cut out the filler I feel like it would have done wonders for this game<br><br>In spite of those flaws the game does have it's merits. The CGs and character portraits were well drawn and even though the gameplay and story weren't exceptional it all came together to create a comfy experience. That's the real draw of this to me though, it's just a nice relaxing experience that was able to easily string me along for 20 some hours, I just wish there was more to it in the end.<br><br><br><br><br>Seana is the cutest\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12285489', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12285489' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12285489\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12285489' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12285489\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12285489', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12285489_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12285489_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17416442\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alexngregory\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"120130842\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a33d65eb52acc6a02213f4befa9aa165359af684.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a33d65eb52acc6a02213f4befa9aa165359af684.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a33d65eb52acc6a02213f4befa9aa165359af684_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alexngregory\/\" data-miniprofile=\"120130842\">alex.n.gregory<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alexngregory\/games\/?tab=all\">3,553 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alexngregory\/recommended\/\">34 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/alexngregory\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 6, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Sacred Tears TRUE is a solid RPG, but has several issues that keep it from achieving greatness.<br><br>Harkening back to 90s-style console JRPG's, Sacred Tears puts you in the shoes of Seil and Seana, a pair of friends who've opened their own private investigative office (and struggle to pay the rent on their lavish house) while simultaneously working as members of their city's Thieves Guild. The game starts with the pair involved in a heist that goes south, and barely escaping before their monetary issues come to the forefront. As the main plot goes on, the player is drawn into their quest to steal a &quot;Sacred Tear&quot; (a highly-prized relic) from an art gallery, as well as dealing with machinations from their own guild and a neighbouring province looking to invade.<br><br>The best part about the game is that it takes place in a serialized fashion. You can pick and choose whether to carry on with the main story or pick up &quot;side jobs&quot; that often don't have combat, and are usually fetch quests for other people. Interestingly, the dialogue of NPCs you find in the city of Genoseed changes mission-to-mission, which does a great job of investing the player into the world and the characters' lives.<br><br>The game also has a battle system, which is where some of the flaws begin to expose themselves. You fight by drawing three cards in a glorified game of rock-paper-scissors, where certain commands (like dodging or attacking) trump other commands. After a certain point (and depending on whether you're overleveled), it becomes less a series of strategic moves and more a question of whether you start with enough attack\/high-level cards (only found through new cards revealed during battles) that you can take down a high-level enemy before they kill you.<br><br>The music is well-orchestrated and fits with with the 90s aesthetic, but this in turn reveals another problem with the game - there are no graphic\/sound options whatsoever. You either have to listen to the same track repeated over and over as you walk through Genoseed, or turn your volume off. Luckily, the game isn't resource-intensive, but it can still be annoying for some people.<br><br>The biggest problem I had with the game (and frankly, with a lot of RPGMaker games) is that there's no map to tell you where to go. More than once, I started a mission and had no idea what building I was supposed to go to next, spending time running in and out of districts until I found the place I needed to be. <br><br>It doesn't help matters that the game practically requires you to have a guide in order to unlock the last few side missions, which only appear once you amassed $300,000. You pretty much have to scrounge for every secret room, hidden item and way of making money in order to achieve this goal, and I don't expect that many people would be able to do it without a walkthrough.<br><br>Likewise, the plot meanders for long periods of time, and the main character (Seil) is a bit of a fool who never really bothers to change his ways or ignores obvious cues people tell him throughout the game. The real star is Seana (who often chastizes you for your habits), who generally keeps things in check when Seil is lost, but doesn't have nearly enough to do in the game.<br><br>In the end, Sacred Tears TRUE stands out as a highlight among the glut of RPGMaker clones on Steam, and focuses on a &quot;slice-of-life&quot; story with lots to see, do and explore in an interesting way.

I want to point out that the other reviews address legitamate issues, like the font size\/style (the game need to have the japanese localized font to look better, there is a post about how to do this). There are complaints about the simplicity of the games' combat, admittedly the combat doesn't have too much depth but is still fun for that same reason. At times you will not think about how you are using your cards (randomly given card based combat, you will see) others I literally take like 5+ minutes before make a move. There is luck involved sometimes but for the most part if you strategize well battles will be a breeze. Don't forget to look at the guide attached to the game. It's the readme.html file, explains how to play, what stats are for and what they do (the game isn't thorough about explaining these in-game).<br><br>The Pros: <br>Innovative-fun combat system albeit somewhat repetitive(stategic at times)<br>fun Dialoge<br>Serious plot moments, satisfying conclusion<br>Maybe some Romance (I thought it was nice)<br>Cute art design<br>Memorable Characters<br><br>The Cons:<br>poorly styled text (have to manually get japanese localized font to fix)<br>True ending is REALLY HARD to get (well you have to check everywhere since enemies don't drop fil)<br>Game still good without True ending<br>Combat takes a while to get used to<br>Certain characters plot not flushed out enough (i didn't unlock ALL chapters so that may be why)<br><br>All-in-All a great wonderful game I'd recomend to ppl that don't mind playing an RPGmaker style game, and are looking for something with great story and decent gameplay.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22809131', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22809131' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22809131\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22809131' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22809131\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22809131', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22809131_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22809131_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short22163446\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/butterlettuceparty\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"100350938\">itsNinjaToast<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">An Amazing Turn-base JRPG Card-based Game<\/div><br>Re-review<br><br>This was my second ever card based game that i ever played both on and out of Steam.<br>Gifted to me by a good friend, to whom gave me to choose any graphic novel back on the <b>Anime Weekend Sales<\/b> list here on Steam, i was going to choose either <u>Sakura Spirit<\/u><i>(50% certain)<\/i> or <u>Hate Plus<\/u><i>(90% certain)<\/i> but by mystake, i ended up choosing this one fantasy JRPG by saying &quot;<b>I like Sacred Tears<\/b>&quot;<i>(not being a novel)<\/i>, but by the time i was going to say &quot;<u>i choose Hate Plus<\/u>&quot;, the gift was already sent to me, and following the old saying &quot;<b>choosers cant be beggars<\/b>&quot;, i simply smiled.<br>So after trying the game out, i found myself really enjoying it.<br>Now being a treasure on my Steam library, the game is actually pretty good, but the only problem i found its that, the chapters are pretty short, sometimes only having one mission to finish it, and you play as a thief wannabe named Seil, not forgeting his long time guild friend Seana, not much to know about that.<br>Seana is a little bossy but hey, so are our mothers right? no?, just me? oh okay then.<br>Wen you\u00b4re finally able to move around the city, and given your first mission to get\/save a golden cat, it\u00b4ll be like deja vu all over again, <b>Thank you Seil! But our cat is in another castle!<\/b>, that said castle being a roof, then being a warehouse, would someone kindly stop doing that.<br>Aside from that the game is very good indeed, im yet to finish it as i have countles others to finish, but i could clearly recommend this one to any JRPG turn-based lover, but for now i must go to sleep, its late. &quot;Wake me when you need me&quot;.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22163446', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22163446' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22163446\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22163446' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22163446\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22163446', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22163446_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22163446_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short21958979\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/xArcelite\/recommended\/316840\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"46823988\">Arcelite<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCute game.
