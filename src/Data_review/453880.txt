The game\u2019s pixel graphics, the way in which it tells its story, its presentation and its sound remind me of the type of games that I played on the Commodore 64. As an occasionally proud retro gamer this can be a very good thing. In the case of Renegade Sector Games\u2019 title I have to admit to being more than a little torn. In a number of ways I am deeply attracted to the game yet in others I feel detached and questioning whether I made the right choice in featuring the game.<br><br>This may be because I never did get around to playing the under appreciated Venusian Vengeance even though the game has long been in my Steam library. As such I have no connection to the game \u2013 which is an indirect sequel, arguably more of a spin off. Therefore there is an understandable disconnect to the game even if I have been advised that you don\u2019t need to have played this game in order to have a good time playing this one. There is a genre difference between the two games as well as this is a classically styled survival horror game.<br><br>If you are the type of player that retrieves most of their story through cut scenes and prefers not to read journal entries, computer terminals and the like then you would easily be forgiven for having ignored the storyline. But there is one and it is up to you to find it. As this could be a game breaker for a large number of players it is something that has to be stated. I am personally on the fence in regards to stories being told in this fashion. It works very well as a tool for games that the player finds deeply engrossing because you want to investigate everything and read everything while for other games it can have the opposite effect.<br><br>There is something on the in game sounds that I wanted to make a mention of but it was more of a candid observation than anything critical. Have you ever played the original Ghostbusters game that was on the Commodore 64? I haven\u2019t heard that typing sound in a video game since and the sound as writing comes up on the screen in dialogue reminds me of it.<br><br>This is a game where you are going to die a lot and will appreciate the save points when you find them. It is also a game where you are going to want to be someone who conserves their ammunition because it can occasionally be very few and far between. You wont necessarily know when and where it is scarce so it is in your best interests to be both a scrounger and less trigger happy. Enemies can prove to be ruthless and you may at times feel as though the AI is too strong but it\u2019s not supposed to be easy \u2013 which it is at other times.<br><br>Ninja Outbreak has the potential to be considered an outstanding game for some players. I know that several of my friends who played it when it was in Greenlight were as eager to play the full release as any game that they had come across in recent times.<br><br>Visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >Steamified<\/a> for more reviews and our epic giveaways\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22286499', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22286499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22286499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22286499' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22286499\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22286499', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22286499_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22286499_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/453880\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 2 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22286499"]}
