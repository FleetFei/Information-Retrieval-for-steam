Don't buy the Jumpstart Pack in game.<br><br>This bundle gives you a code that you can redeem on your Anarchy Online account in order to enable this pack to be claimed in-game in the item store. The pack gives you a few useful things, and a couple questionable things too.<br><br>The Luxurious armor set is pretty great, I won't lie. You get a pretty large EXP bonus by wearing it, it scales to your level (up to 200) and it adds some fairly useful stats too. Any newly made character will benefit from wearing this, and unless you are twinking out a character or have someone hooking you up with some high power armor like Combined or OFAB, this armor set works totally fine for your whole leveling time up to 200.<br><br>You also get 5 nano cans, which are one time use only. The EXP boosts are nice, but the other 3 are stuff you will probably want to hang on to until much later. You can't get a +20 attribute buff of this type from any other player, so it's something you may want to use to equip some implants much later, or something of that nature.<br><br>Lastly you get a &quot;smart backpack&quot; which is just a normal backpack that's nodrop, basically. I think its supposed to be sort of a nostalgia-nod to the old Jobe backyard training area in which this item was a reward, but functiionally it doesn't really do anything other than work as any other backpack does, but I guess you do save a handful of credits at early levels by not having to by an extra backpack.<br><br>You can't redeem the items until you get out of the Arete Landing starting zone, since there is no mailbox there, so depending on how long you stay\/level up there, you won't immediately get to reap the benefits of this pack on a newly created character. But as soon as you get out, you can instantly claim it, so it at least comes into play early on enough.<br><br>I DEFINITELY recommend this over the Jumpstart pack available in-game, as that pack is only one-per-character.<br><br>Overall, it's a pretty cool pack for the EXP boost armor alone. I make a lot of new characters so this has proven to be very useful for me. I never have to worry about getting a main armor set for my characters the entire time I am leveling them now, basically.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30716536', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30716536' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30716536\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30716536' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30716536\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30716536', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30716536_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30716536_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30716536"]}
