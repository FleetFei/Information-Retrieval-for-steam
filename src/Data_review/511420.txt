This game, while in very early stages of development, successfully achieves many things that I would like to bring out in my review.<br><br>Graphics:<br>The graphics, as can be seen from the screenshots, are not on part with many other early VR Games but they are unique for their gameplay. It is based on simple geometric shapes that have interesting colors and promote a calm gameplay.<br><br>Audio: <br>The audio seems very appropriate for this game. I loved the intro music while in the menu and especially the progressing songs with the increasing stages, Beginner, Intermediate, Expert etc where the songs had gotten more intense to flow better with the level design.<br><br>Level Design:<br>I feel like the levels are appropriately designed in terms of increasing difficulty. The beginner level acts as a mini tutorial while having you play through the level at the same time, which I appreciate. (No time wasting here) Higher levels seem to get progressively larger\/longer with farther spaced out objects varying in height and distance.<br><br>Immersion:<br>The game does a good job making you feel like you are actually standing on a platform, although the vertigo effect is not as prevalent as in other games that deal with platforms and or height. <br><br>Gameplay:<br>The game does a great job of providing you with different powerups which can keep you more alert and not spamming shots mindlessly, angle and charge time matters here!<br><br>Misc Notes and Suggestions:<br>1) Graphically wise, the gun and background can use a bit of TLC to get it to have more of an immersive feel.<br>2) Perhaps an addition of multiple gun types such as different types of blasters\/teleporters which enable you to store more ammo, have different powerups, quicker charge up times and so on, variety is key here.<br>3) Would be interesting to see a different game type because currently replay-ability seems a bit scarce after you finish the levels, perhaps adding enemies at each platform or at platforms ahead who are trying to knock you off and you must fight them off or defend with some sort of shield.<br>4) Please add some sort of scoring system\/leader boards so that we have something to replay and or compete with such as who reached the finish line the fastest, number of shots\/teleports taken etc<br><br>Conclusion:<br>This is a very early game in development as the developer has mentioned.<br>Having experienced this first hand, I give credit where credit is due, and that is the core gameplay mechanic and simplicity. With a low\/entry price tag and promise from the developer of further improvement and addition of content, I recommend this game in order to support it being grown into something even better. The idea, concept and immersion is there. This is a very simple game to kill time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24947718', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24947718' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24947718\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24947718' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24947718\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24947718', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24947718_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24947718_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/511420\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24947718"]}
