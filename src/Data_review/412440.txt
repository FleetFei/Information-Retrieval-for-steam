It has a bit of sim city vibe in the sense that the player has to make sure that each house is supported with water and power, but the levels seem fairly rigid in structure; you won't be building wondeours cities of your own design.<br><br>No, at it's heart Jane's Reality is a time management, and one that demands a frenzy of clicking at that.  There is no relaxed mode or carrying on with a level if the time runs out.  The player has to complete various goals while keeping track of tenet happiness and random events that necessitate a clean up or repair order.  It starts out slowly enough that learning the gameplay is easy enough, but I soon found out that this is a game that doesn't really like the concept of downtime or taking a moment to breath.  Think and work fast!<br><br>I didn't play more than an hour when I wrote this review, so I don't know about all the  issues that might crop up.  I did encounter a situation where I one of my goals was to upgrade a house, and getting the ability to do so was difficult.  I finally figured out that you have to give enough presents to your tenents to get them to send the request, but it seemed kinds of overly random to me to get the option to full the requirement of the level.<br><br>The graphics are pretty much what one would expect from a 2008 game.  Servicable and not ugly, but hardly cutting edge either.  The sound effects are fine, and the music is easily mutable, which is how I play all my games.  It seems there are only 24 levels, but since the game only costs $2.99 that doesn't seem unreasonable.  <br><br>In short, if the idea of a fairly difficult, very fast paced time management game appeals to you, then for the price this one is a solid, if not perfect, investment.<br><br>6\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18653691', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18653691' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18653691\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18653691' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18653691\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18653691', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18653691_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18653691_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/412440\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 4 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["18653691"]}
