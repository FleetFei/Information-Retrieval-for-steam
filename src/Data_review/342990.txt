Its strong part is story dynamic - it flows continously. Actions which are required for progression are grouped in small sets of locations to minimize the frustration of pixelhunting. Actually, I haven't noticed any major 'how-to-progress' gameplay stalling.<br><br>Pros:<br>1)Graphics is quite pleasing even for 2010<br>2)Continous story progression due to smart areas segmentation(it behaves more like interactive movie than brainbreaker)<br>3)Story is quite positive with its own dark twists(If you played The New Beginning you may notice similar character motives and EVEN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS in puzzles)<br>4)Puzzles are grotesque, but simple enough to take just enough time to be fun instead of PITA<br>5)The Cop Character is powered by mild metagaming. It is hard to explain. You need to play the game to get the idea. Maybe it was intentional to give player that 'cop intuition' feel xD<br>6)Able to create tension and suspence without ugly timers on screen and 'game over' messages. Just the wild ways of the story and you.<br>Cons:<br>1)Crashbugs! Tonns of it. Save often, but nothing gamebreaking.<br>2)Characters are stereotypes. Actually it helps the story, but some people don't like when it is that way.<br>3)Game beginning is a bit chaotic and has no backstory except on need-to-know basis<br>4)A bit hardcore: it doesn't have 'journals' or task indicators, but it is mostly straightforward<br>5)One ending. But, you know, movies have only one ending too ;)<br><br>Highly recommended. I love it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15188881', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15188881' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15188881\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15188881' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15188881\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15188881', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15188881_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15188881_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/recommended\/342990\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29197337\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"45910853\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5647b62cb87abf53ca80350f9d87c43c66dc3944.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5647b62cb87abf53ca80350f9d87c43c66dc3944.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/5647b62cb87abf53ca80350f9d87c43c66dc3944_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/\" data-miniprofile=\"45910853\">Pointnclickster<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/games\/?tab=all\">354 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/recommended\/\">103 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pointnclickster\/recommended\/342990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received 15 Days for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is going to read like an editorial so consider yourselves warned.<br><br>People, I am upset. You know why? This is a good game and it doesn't get the credit it deserves. First I would like to address some criticisms that this game receives and then I will give my personal review.<br><br>When I read that this game crashed constantly, I decided I still wanted to give it a go. The story sounded very original and I liked what I saw from the store page. I played this on Windows 7. Did the game crash? Yes. 3 times in over 6 hours of game play. People, a Fallout game can do that. This is a game meant for an older OS and it says so right on the page. I never had the game crash on the major sections that are commonly complained about in the discussions section, and my game never crashed during or after a cutscene. <br><br>To help with not having to lose a lot of ground due to a probable crash, I autosaved after going to each new location. This game gets slack for not having an autosave option. To manually save takes seconds, and to see this as a negative is failing to understand when this game came out. Autosave after every checkpoint is still fairly new, and takes away responsibility from the player. Who remembers memory cards, or finding the typewriter and hoping to have ink ribbon? ;) All in all, having to manually save should not be a shot against this game.<br><br>Now that I have gotten that off my chest, here is the review. I loved it. The opening cinematic is beautiful and action packed. The music is right out of a spy-action thriller movie. Then we meet our characters. This is where it gets interesting because they are a group of likeable criminals. The voice acting is well done and the bonds are felt between the characters, especially as the plot thickens. You primarily play as Cathryn, the leader of the three thieves. There will be times when you will change who you control, since each plays their own role in a heist. You also play as the international police officer who is investigating a murder and is on their trail. Are their art thefts and the political murders linked? Well, that would be telling.<br><br>This game is more like an interactive movie than a point and click game. But its a good movie. The puzzles are much more down to earth and not outlandish like in P&amp;C games of the 90's. There are certain minigames such as hacking security, or finding ones way through the Parisian catacombs; Each security hack is different so it isn't the same tired formula. Sometimes its hacking lasers; or its cameras; or its amusements rides, and they all have different methods. Also, they are skippable! After so much time has passed and you find that you are stumped, you can skip it and continue with the game. I found myself stumped 1 out of 5 minigames and found them to be a fun addition to the game. While the game isn't hard, I wasn't bored with the easy gameplay. The story kept the game going. I think that is what the developers had in mind: Don't get bogged down by puzzles or furious over minigames--keep the story going.<br><br>Now the technical aspects. The cut scenes are of noticeably better quality than the in game graphics, but I think that should be expected. I believe that the game looks good. The sound may need a bit of toggling. If you have everything at full volume, you will hear this great soundtrack and hardly any vocals. Although if you opt for subtitles you can read everything but then you'll miss the great voice work. I found I had to turn down the music and turn the voices on all the way to get a good balance, but this may depend on your sound setup. The music is awesome! I felt like I was in a spy-thriller-espionage movie! It was great. Also, all the dialogue and cutscenes are skippable by pressing Esc., so that IF your game does crash, you don't have to suffer through lots of dialogue and cutscenes. <br><br>Now I really want to talk about what I love the most. The story is good but the themes are what seperates this one from all the others. Moral relativism is something I haven't seen explored so fully in a P&amp;C game as in this game. These characters feel very real. They are good people who do something wrong for all the right reasons. They sometimes doubt if they are doing the right thing. They fight, they argue, they cover each other. The officer you play as is atrocious, but he follows his leads, even if ordered not to. These characters have ideaologies and they face situations that make them question what they think, especially Cathryn. She is young and very idealistic. Mild spoiler ahead, but I believe it necessary. Near the end of the game Cathryn has dinner with the main villain. The villain stays in the shadows for most of the game, but it does make sense in the plot. When Cathryn is invited by him personally to dine, it is done in a very civil manner. She goes to his house and he is the perfect host. No torture sequence, no being locked up. Just a dinner in which a very confused Cathryn tries to find out who this person is. How could this perfectly charming host be this horrible person? He calmly tells her about himself-his history, his family, his hope to reconnect with his daughter someday, and yes, the things he felt necessary to do for his people and country. What is scary is that from his point of view, he is justified. His logic makes sense. I don't want to give anything else away, but that dinner sequence was amazing: an older antagonist trying to enlighten a young idealistic protagonist and challenge everything she has ever believed. Charisma in the hands of evil is a very dangerous thing.<br><br>Now the ending: It worked. It ties up all the loose ends and even leaves room for a sequel, which it could take or leave.<br><br>I really liked this game. I feel bad for the slack that it has gotten. It's P&amp;C lite, and more of an interactive movie, but its a great one. If you can operate it on a older OS system, again Win7 worked fine for the most part, I seriously suggest you try it. If you are hesitant, wait for a sale, but don't pass this one up.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29197337', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29197337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29197337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29197337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29197337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29197337', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29197337_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29197337_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21651254\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007688772\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"47423044\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78ad01d00d475cf67d9733eaa6bd73b6f03cc218.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78ad01d00d475cf67d9733eaa6bd73b6f03cc218.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/78ad01d00d475cf67d9733eaa6bd73b6f03cc218_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007688772\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47423044\">Aargh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007688772\/games\/?tab=all\">688 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007688772\/recommended\/\">304 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007688772\/recommended\/342990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's not a bad adventure game. It's not a good game either, more of a &quot;meh&quot; experience, but it doesn't entirely deserve the negative rating here.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Interesting story.<br>- Decent graphics.<br>- Very good voice acting.<br>- Great movement controls - you can walk, run, fast travel between rooms and teleport on the map.<br>- Skippable cutscenes and dialogues!<br><br>Cons:<br>- During the 9 hours of my playtime the game crashed 15+ time. That's a lot. It's even worse that the game doesn't have autosave so you have to save a lot. Thankfully, all cutscenes can be skipped so you can quickly catch up from an older save. Also, one cutscene at the end of the game crashes every single time. After many tries I had to skip the cutscene and watch it on YouTube.<br>- The game has no journal and the protagonists give you no clues on what you are supposed to do next. So if you don't remember everything everyone said you will be lost all the time. This is especially bad if your playthrough is split between several days.<br>- Bad audio balance in dialogues. Often the background noise was so loud I couldn't hear the dialogue. Thankfully the game has subtitles.<br>- Bad minigames. Fortunately skippable.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21651254', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21651254' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21651254\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21651254' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21651254\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21651254', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21651254_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21651254_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26026429\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112866114\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"152600386\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/353d92b931ae408cffadc8105de0489d61b85ecc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/353d92b931ae408cffadc8105de0489d61b85ecc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/353d92b931ae408cffadc8105de0489d61b85ecc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112866114\/\" data-miniprofile=\"152600386\">kyzka<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112866114\/games\/?tab=all\">2,448 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112866114\/recommended\/\">157 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198112866114\/recommended\/342990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">168.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all I'm not a person who normally enjoys point and click adventures as I find them rather slow developing and cumbersome story wise and this game is by no means any different. Also I agree with those who highlight that there are a string of nasty game crashes which most people will get to experience especially in the Paris\/catacomb region. While there is an inbuilt crash reporter in game, one would wonder if this actually works since those crashes have been existent since the games release back in 2010. So how does one report a bug if the bug is actually the bug reporter? Any ideas? Email the developer you say. Good idea! One problem though, the German Developer known as 'House of Tales' doesn't seem to exist anymore, at least there is no easy to find web site to contact him on. Hence the answer so far is to simply save game constantly and reload after crash and work through the matter that way.<br><br>The game is a simple point and click adventure dressed up to look like a movie rip off like 'Entrapment' with a cheeky wink here and there to the James Bond Franchise especially to its evil character lore\u2019s. You play various parts of a trio group who have vowed to make the world a better place by stealing expensive works of art from the rich and then give the proceeds to charity by selling them on the black market, earning this trio a Robin Hood image. <br><br>While the game eventually explores this notion more in depth exposing the blaring weakness behind the group\u2019s logic, it also explores a whole range of loose end stories. For one thing the members of your group may have independent hidden motives that you are not aware of, the estranged relationship between a member of your group called Cathryn and her father may have more to it than what she is admitting and finally the paranoia and the sickness of a comrade who paints illegal copies for you, may have more foundation in truth than make-believe.<br><br>You also spasmodically get to witness and be involved in the investigation of international police who is investigating a bizarre string of deaths regarding political figures and how there seems to be a nonsensical art stealing connection behind it all.<br><br>The game after treating your eyes to a sexy animation at the beginning quickly falls flat thanks to a slow informative development which at the time really seems to be going nowhere. You really don't get too appreciate that ALL things in this game are relevant till the very end when the villain invites you back into his lair so that he can tell you about his entire diabolical plot. While this comically reminds us of Albert Broccoli\u2019s James Bond formula, they really do a decent job of this in game and it really does make sense for once why the villain would invite you in and why the villain would want to tell you everything. In fact maybe Albert Broccoli could take out a pen and paper and make a note here and there for upcoming Bond movies.<br><br>However unlike Bond movies the down side is that the concluding animation is nowhere near as sexy as what the game begins with and with the constant build up to a final big explosion, it eventually falls flat with a small fizzle display which wouldn't even raise an eyebrow to Michael Bay. <br><br>So why do I wave an Olympic sized thumbs up in the faces of angered customers and glaringly bad design choices? <br><br>Well for one thing I really appreciate how they tie in all the loose ends at the end. It\u2019s an idea they chose to follow which I haven't seen in any other form of media. You see the person the trio is working for is a genocidal maniac whose belief system is expressed in a secret room in his mansion which I can only describe as 'messed up'. It\u2019s the uniqueness of the story itself and the way it is presented that I have a deep respect for. It didn't just feel like I was playing a cheaply made rip off. There was just more to it than that. In fact his back story was so real that I had to do a quick google search after playing this game to see if Elengi of Surinawa was in fact a real person or not. He isn't, but you can easily see how he could have been.<br><br>Secondly while the beginning is seriously missing a musical score to get you in the mood, when it does eventually cut in, it really does make you feel that you\u2019re a part of the heist. Accompanied with this is the fact that the voice dubbing was pretty flawless in my books. I could easily envision the characters being that way and saying the things they did. Granted the stereotypes were frustrating especially with Mike. In fact I have never seen a more annoying game character in game than this one. His constant guffawing\u2019s of his own greatness was enough for me to wish that the other two would pick him up by the ankles and use his head as a toilet brush. He is seriously more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in Star wars. Mike the most annoying and out of character in any medium I have ever seen, would probably be more in character and give George Lucas a wet dream if he was to appear in an Alien pub covered in fur. It\u2019s just something you have to experience to BELIEVE. However on the flip side Mike does have one of the best lines in the game. It's the very last line he does with the villain. Classic!<br><br>While they spend 5 days to steal one painting and 10 days to steal another, the title '15 days' has a double meaning as revealed at the end and kind of leaves the story open to an upcoming sequel. If they do make a sequel and I hope they do, I really hope that they finish that one off with a sexier animation than what they begin the game with. Something that would make Manga people fall to the floor and do obeisance too. Also if you hint to an explosion in the end, don't give me a fizzle. I want a BANG. I want a Kaboom which would rupture my ear drums and wake up Godzilla at the same time and finally any chance you can kill Mike? How about we call the sequel '15 days to die'? Mike gets sick and Cathryn's forced to get that baseball bat with barbwire out of the closet.<br><br>In final a really unique story idea which nicely ties up all loose ends at the conclusion. A game which at several parts both grabs a gamers interest and loses it just as quickly. A game which has one of the most annoying game characters I have ever witnessed now placed on my hit list. A game with its current crashing issues is simply not worth the price they are asking, but is worth at least a gander when it does go on sale and if you\u2019re a point and click enthusiast.<br><br>Below is me playing the game through the slow part when you finally meet up with your Nigerian Scammer wannabe. It should be enough of an example for you to work out if this is a game for you....

To be fair, I agree with the following flaws: The game crashes, a lot. I was a bit worried I wasn't going to make it through to the end becuase sometimes it would crash in the same spot, but I did. Just keep re-loading till it works and save often. The other major flaw is that there really aren't very many puzzles at all. Mostly you click on things and the story progresses (this was minor for me though, cuz I wanted something easy).<br><br>On the plus side I found the story interesting, and kept wanting to come back to it. Sure it has some plotholes and a few too many coincidences, but overall not bad. This is the 2nd time that House of Tales has entertained me.

Usually after restarting the game it then didn't crash at the point it did before, but one part I really couldn't get past a scene without crashing, so I was forced to watch the scene on YouTube and just cancel the scene that caused me to crash by hitting escape which allowed me to continue.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19700983', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19700983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19700983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19700983' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19700983\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19700983', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19700983_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19700983_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29711614\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022039830\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"61774102\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022039830\/\" data-miniprofile=\"61774102\">Monroe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022039830\/games\/?tab=all\">500 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022039830\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198022039830\/recommended\/342990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game actually isn't bad. I'd say it should get a 6\/10 or 7\/10. The acting is great, storyline is great, the puzzle finding makes sense. Some stuff towards the end kind of don't make a ton of sense from a story telling standpoint but overall I'd recommend this game. I got it in a bundle which came to about 90 cents per game. <br><br>The reason for the low score were the crashes. Now, I didn't have any crashes with the web search feature in game that some players have reported. But for me it did crash in three places. When I first entered catacombs, at the disco's entrance, and turning on a flash light when I went back to the catacombs. These spots are very obvious when you're playing the game. I got through all 3 crashes by simply skipping the dialogue. I don't think I missed much, heck one scene I just missed Cathryn flipping on a flash light. So just double hit esc and the game should work if you find yourself crashing at points. <br><br>I'm not sure why this game is so unstable. I played Overclocked: A History of Violence which came out three years earlier and part of the same pack and had no crashes with that and it used the same engine. It's kind of frustrating since I think this game's storyline is better and they set it up for a sequel we'll never see.

Not sure it's worth \u00a38.99 but on sale it's worth trying out.<br>It's a point and click mystery\/adventure style game. The storyline is really nicely done, which is what makes me recommend this game. It's quite cutscene and speech heavy so don't get this if all you want is action. You can't die or lose so really this is about playing for solving reasonably simple puzzles and progressing the storyline.<br><br>Cons:<br>Crashes quite a lot. Save often.<br>Short gameplay time. Probably around 15 hrs for most.<br><br>Other folk on here are right that the movement and conversations are slightly clunky, but this didn't put me off at all as I'm not often bothered about it functioning perfectly if the meat of the game is right.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20608358', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20608358' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short20608358\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20608358' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short20608358\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20608358', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short20608358_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short20608358_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/342990\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 61 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["15188881","29197337","21651254","26026429","22348317","19700983","29711614","30223583","16906738","25379581"]}
