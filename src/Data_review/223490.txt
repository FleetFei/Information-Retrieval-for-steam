I understand the mixed reviews but boy does this game have a lot of potential. The block building detail goes way beyond Minecraft unless you load it up with mods. What this game still lacks is dedicated multiplayer server support(only peer 2 peer is an option right now) and a streamlined UI.  People will usually complain about how Jens (the developer) stopped releasing updates for almost a year at one point (at which time the game was being re-written from the ground up from what I'm told). I'm not completely happy with the new look because I was sold on the realistic look which looked amazing years ago and still looks amazing today!. The draw distance is absolutely incredible! I prefer playing in realistic mode because of the better cave systems (kinda similar to what I'm used to in Rising World).<br><br>I was hesitant to buy because of the previously steep price tag and bad reviews from the past but then I noticed something, over the past year Jens has been cranking out updates pretty rapidly. He even finally started making tweaks to the UI and adding some on-screen tutorials which was beneficial to me because if you've never played this game before and look at the UI, you'll get confused easily. Well, I'm getting the hang of it. Does it still need lots of work? Sure. Do I wish the game was done years ago? Sure. But it is a fun game and Jens hasn't given up on plus he recently dropped the price which was a really smart move. Seems like he is dedicated to completing this project and seems like the game is on the rebound after a bad year so I choose to support him for perserverence. I've heard of plenty abandonware games but this is not one of them. The game is still needing of some more critical features but it seems to be heading in the right direction again. I read on his twitter that he's going to put more work into the realistic world again (or merge the two world types) which i'm really looking forward to finally.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30695124', 'summary' );

I would still recommend this game, it has a really great platform as a voxel building game. However, terrain generation is headed in a new, blocky direction that I'm not fond of.<br><br>Original review:<br>Frustrating to see so many &quot;not recommended&quot;s because &quot;The developer has abandoned&quot;.<br><br>Visit the actual blockscape webpage\/forums and you'll find out that he's very active. They keep a dev blog and are very active with the community there. ***There haven't been many updates because the dev has been doing a complete engine re-write, which (from the devlog sounds like it's going well)<br><br>Do some research before you jump to the conclusion that the developer isn't going to update\/isn't working on the game.  This game is early access and nowhere near the finished product. The graphics are absolutely stunning and if you can read that statement and cringe then you need to not pay $20 for a game you know you won't be able to run. <br><br>I bought this game in early 2013 and it has come a very very long way. At that point there was nothing but a &quot;creative&quot; mode essentially with a survival mode that only differed by having you obtain the materials before you used them at seemingly random harvest rates.<br><br>Now theres much more to the game, even with a well done electrical system. If you buy this and find yourself floundering with the insane amount of build control, visit the official blockscape forums and download some of the maps other players have made for inspiration. The landscapes are so stunning that I often find myself forgetting where I am (irl) and getting lost for hours just exploring the world, and never finding a place that I want to desicrate with my mediocre building skills.

It has changed drastically since the very first form that it had taken. However, to me this isn't as important as the person behind the game. Obviously a game can't be developed without a hard-working individual, or group behind it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">About the Developer<\/div><br>Jens Blomquist is the sole developer of this game, and following every comment or post made by him, every image that he's released or any video, I've began to notice one inherently obvious fact: He is passionate about this game. Though there have been periods of a lack of communication this isn't through his lack of desire to discuss things with the people that are playing the game. In the official forums, when they were up and running, he would often discuss things with people.<br><br>But most of all, these periods of him being under the radar are because he's working so hard on a project he believes in. In an age of games that are being developed just to try and make more money it's refreshing to have followed someone for so long, to see their mood raise when people are genuinely engaged in what has been shown or developed, I feel that is quite rare. I'm not saying that other developers don't care about their games, but in regards to Jens, I absolutely know that he does. To say anything otherwise is something I consider to be unfair.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Game Itself<\/div><br>Currently the game is changing quite frequently. The gameplay and interface is still a little bit complicated or convoluted, there are few tools, but numerous manipulation shapes that you effectively equip, rather than equipping a shape to place. I believe this will be down to the fact that there are so many materials; to have, for example a triangle in 30-something varieties would be absurd, considering you would have a square in those same 30-something varieties. As it stands, there needs to be a better way to utilize this. Perhaps an object that lets you convert any material into a shape, with a return on any blocks it doesn't use (one can assume that in a square of 64 blocks, a triangle is roughly half this, thus returning 50% of the blocks used). There needs to be far more simplification.<br><br>Additionally, often there may be rendering issues but this is likely due to an understanding lack of optimization - Why optimize something when you're still implementing features? I purchased this game around 5, maybe 6 years ago. Similar to the stock market, it's something I've invested in and periodically return to see how it's progressing. Personally, I find the larger levels of detail to be wonderful. Any time I build something in any game, I consider that detail to be a god-send. The worlds are large but currently without many terrain features, though most recently one was added to make things more varied. I expect in time there will be fields, subtle hills, gorges, caves, etc..<br><br>Movement itself is fine, though it feels very robotic right now due to a lack of head-bobbing. Strangely though, I would actually turn this feature off were it there. There needs to be some effect that emphasizes movement. The actual placing of blocks is good, you use your scroll-wheel to adjust the size of the block, from 1x1, to 2x2 then 8x8. I find myself overwhelmed at times with what to build. You can build the simplest of structures or a meticulous castle. It depends on how long you're willing to spend.<br><br>Currently, albeit slowly, there are features being added. Most recently there were creatures, bombs and terrain collapsing, and the game completely changed it's look. This change in look was a bold decision by Jens himself. Imagine if Infinity Ward had changed Call of Duty from realistic to cel-shaded? You would consider them mental. This would be a massive risk to the sales of the game but they wouldn't do it without good reason. Something similar happened here. The world generation completely changed, but there are absolutely numerous good reasons as to why this change has occured.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">In Summary<\/div><br>As it is one man, things will be slow. You do need to understand this if you are going to purchase the game. I have seen many complaints about how slow development is, these complaints are negative and unfortunately have the effect of causing development to be even slower - Less sales, less money, unable to hire people. Quite ironic, really. I'm <b>not saying<\/b> that people aren't entitled to their opinion, truly you are, but to criticise the development of a game as being slow when one person is behind it (and the game is in early access, no less) is like shooting yourself in the foot. I suggest in the meantime if you are prone to being impatient, don't buy this game yet. It needs a good, supportive and patient community of people that can give feedback and help it develop. Remember how long No Man's Sky took? I'm not comparing the two, but the only reason that wasn't subject to as much flak (though it received a fair share) is that it wasn't accessible to all but the people creating it.<br><br>Early Access can be good, but not when people expect to play a fully-functioning game from the moment they buy it. <b>That is not the purpose of accessing a game early.<\/b> You are there to help and support something you care about. I do care about this game, otherwise I wouldn't post this review.<br><br>Personally, I'm enjoying the wait and I'm in no hurry to play something that I trust, when completed, will be precisely what the creator wants it to be. I trust Jens' decisions and no matter what the game becomes I know I'll enjoy it because to me, the passion and investments of the person behind it are more important than what I think. You might call this blind, but in regards to any artform, passion shows.<br><br>The more passion there is, the better the end result. And I have no doubts that Jens has plenty of passion.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28187028', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28187028' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28187028\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28187028' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28187028\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28187028', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28187028_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28187028_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28195138\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198099635950\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"139370222\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/35875fdbc5e7f0aaa5665940126fbb80479da3d6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/35875fdbc5e7f0aaa5665940126fbb80479da3d6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/35\/35875fdbc5e7f0aaa5665940126fbb80479da3d6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198099635950\/\" data-miniprofile=\"139370222\">Drop The Reality<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198099635950\/games\/?tab=all\">117 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198099635950\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198099635950\/recommended\/223490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">123.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Blockscape was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am rewriting this review on 12\/4\/2016.<br><br>So, at this point, the game has a very negative review base. I will inform you why that is, and why I do recommend the game.<br><br>First some history (not long, don't bail now, I know history can be boring to some people!). Blockscape was going very far, had a beautiful world, and was just wonderful to look at. Well, eventually the game got too overwhelming for the solo developer (Jens Blomquist) to keep going for a while, and he took a break. He wanted to figure out where the game was going to go. During this period the reviews started to shoot down because the game was being labeled as abandoned. But it actually wasn't. He just got overwhelmed, being alone in this project and having such an advanced type of game (I know voxel programming some, and it is not easy in the slightest). So after roughly a year and a half, he released Blockscape's biggest update. Made the game a completely new game. Now the reviews are still bad, but he is actually releasing great updates weekly. The reviews are starting to go up. We can make them go higher if we try because he has found the right path now!<br><br>On to the game's review itself.<br><br>Blockscape is a wonderful looking world of creativity. The survival elements are not there yet, at least not all the way, but the creative elements are great. You can build amazing things, with loads of shapes, materials, and even 3 sizes of every block. You can build large structure with Minecraft sized blocks, and then add major detail with tiny bite-sized blocks! All shapes (cubes, slopes, corners, other weird shapes) come in the 3 sizes, and you can even turn off the grid snap! The graphics are fantastic in my opinion. The gameplay is now solid, there are nowhere near as many bugs now as there used to be, and all kinds of things are being updated and improved regularly. <br><br>Now for some pros and cons;<br><br><br>PROS:<br><br>-Graphics - The graphics are great. They look nice and give a good style to the game to make it unique (my opinion)<br><br>-Gameplay - The gameplay, while not loaded with oodles of content, is still fun. It can be a little tricky to get the hang of, but still good.<br><br>-Building - The building in this game, according to me, is much better than building in Minecraft or 7DtD, etc. The amount of detail you can get into is amazing.<br><br>-Loads of materials, block shapes, and building tools - The title of this 'pro' says it all.<br><br>-Developer Communication - He is very good about responding to posts and questions.<br><br><br>CONS:<br><br>-GUI - Needs improvement. I like the way that your tools are handled with one hotbar and materials with another, that is fine, but what is hard to get used to is the way the GUI works. It is a bit un-intuitive, but not horrible.<br><br>-Multiplayer - It is not very easy to setup, though this one is kind of just my problem, other people have no problems, so this one you can ignore. You have to port forward, and sometimes it crashes, but that could just be me, not sure. It is early access after all.<br><br>-Price - While I love this game, I do think the price is a bit high. Maybe 10-15 would be better for now.<br><br><br>MIXED (Good and Bad):<br><br>-Bugs\/Performance - The performance, while still relatively slow, is much better than it used to be. It has some bugs here and there, but also nowhere near as bad as it used to be. After playing for 1 to 2 hours (depending on your machine of course, those are numbers according to my PC) it starts to delay when you build. You click, 1-2 seconds later, the block is placed. This is not always the case, but it does happen.<br><br><br>So overall, yes I recommend this game. Now that you know the history of 'why' this has a bad review, it is up to you to decide if you want this game. Remember, bad reviews because he took a break, lost the &quot;sight&quot; of the game, but now he has gained it back and the game is doing great. So does he really deserve a bad review still? He has fixed those things that made the community upset with him. So, choose wisely young one.<br><br>Jens, if you read this, thank you for making this game. I read your last News Post, and I hope it doesn't come to that and I hope this review helps the rating go up.

And when I say early access i mean really early access. This game is made only by one person and recently had a complete overhaul of style and mechanics. It has lots of bugs and glitches but it is one of its kind. I've been searching for hours for similar games and this one just destroys the competition.<br><br>Important thing! This game is absolutely not abandonned! You want to hear news? Follow developer's twitter (@JensBlomquist).<br><br>Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! I'd recommend it to anyone who needs something better for building than minecraft and for someone who can put up with all the bugs and glitches.<br>It is really beautiful and powerful, even now in it's early stage.<br><br>If you are looking for a more finished product all you can do is wait. The developer is doing what he can, but complexity of this game and the fact that he is the only person responsible for this game indicates that it's not going to be finished soon.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24611288', 'summary' );

The graphics style changed significantly in this time (from highly realistic to more manageable\/gamelike set-level terrain), and many of the poor reviews seem to be due to people not liking this change. On the plus side, this change meant that the dev was more easily able to add features, the latest being a couple of enemy mobs with fairly simple AI. <br><br>The dev is working on this game alone and hasn't always been the best at communicating progress, leading to many fans thinking that he had abandoned it. The updates are irregular both in terms of frequency and content, but the game is defintely not abandoned. If you can make your own fun with an excellent building mechanic and patience is one of your virtues, then I would recommend this game to you in its current state.  The scenery and music are beautiful, and make for a relaxing atmosphere to build or explore. There are still a few crash bugs though, so remember to save often!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23254231', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23254231' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23254231\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23254231' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23254231\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23254231', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23254231_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23254231_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24489446\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/I_keeel_U\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11138078\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04b16b3ed10f6bd8e0b7a28c7cf0d7a331fd95d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04b16b3ed10f6bd8e0b7a28c7cf0d7a331fd95d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/04b16b3ed10f6bd8e0b7a28c7cf0d7a331fd95d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/I_keeel_U\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11138078\">Poofie Love bird<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/I_keeel_U\/games\/?tab=all\">1,147 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/I_keeel_U\/recommended\/\">214 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/I_keeel_U\/recommended\/223490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Blockscape was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDeveloper was brave enough to start over from scratch , and I think it was totally worrth it. <br><br>Walking around the world is really neat.

While it is rough and needs alot of work it has great potential. The dev has been pushing out steady updates and each one makes the game run better and adds in more cool features. We were just given a way to create miniature terrain! This game has the potential to be so much better than the games it draws inspiration from (minecraft, etc).  I hope this game can recover from the negative reviews and thrive.

The the creator of this game has cut the price from 19.99 to 9.99.<br>To me 9.99 is a great price for this game because the game offers the ability to build things at a much smaller scale allowing you to make more detailed creations.  This makes the building aspect much more satisfying than that of minecraft (though minecraft has it's own thing going for it).  <br>The Game as of recently has been updated on a monthly basis, (sometimes more often) and as of the state of the game now, the building aspects of the game are enjoyable and worth 10 dollars even if the game is never updated.  character models, npc's and a few other things need improvements.<br><br>I reccomend this Game to those who want a more detailed building experience than minecraft currently offers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29970280', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29970280' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29970280\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29970280' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29970280\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29970280', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29970280_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29970280_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29816240\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982708302\/recommended\/223490\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"22442574\">Foolsbry<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Blockscape was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is definitely quite early in development, but it evokes an early Minecraft sort of feeling. The graphics are quite nice and it's good to see a survival construction game that doesn't rely on looking like Minecraft as a crutch. This game has it's own unique style, which apparently different from what it fist looked like, upsetting the earlier players. I wouldn't say this is a bad thing; the lower poly - but not completely cubic look is great, and there are nice little touches like the grass blocks having overhanging grass textures.<br><br>Overall  while this game has a fair way to go in terms of adding content, there is a lot of potential and I would love to see where the developer is going to go with it. It also looks like he's stepped up his game recently and is releasing updates pretty regularly. Coming from a one-man-show, this is a great game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29816240', 'recent_short' );

No for someone who doesn't have extra money to spend into in developement game with very little features right now and without a timeline. <br><br>It's little disappointment for me that we never got a working &quot;realistic generation&quot; but that's something i can live with because the primary point for me is that you can build very detailed buildings and so on...<br><br>And if you made so far reading this... i bought this game about 4 years from the time im writing this from his website so i have seen almost every version of this game even those that were blocky before the whole &quot;realistic&quot; thing even was in the game.<br><br>FOR THE DEV: i really did like the early version of blocky world before the random gen, and i hope that we can see something like that once again.<br>Keep on working with this and someday this game might get it's glory back.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29542000', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29542000' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29542000\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29542000' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29542000\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29542000', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29542000_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29542000_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/223490\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 747 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30695124","30563273","14145877","28187028","28195138","24611288","20979366","23254231","24489446","29551485"]}
