That turned out to be a low-grade glioma in his brain, so surgery and recovery took up the bulk of the season for him.<br><br>Now, I have a soft spot for what-if scenarios in these types of games, so I was definitely excited to see not just his inclusion in the title, but also this minor expansion announced. He now has four paint schemes, is a spotter voice option, and has two challenges that pit him in fantasy scenarios where he not only recovered but ended up in the Sprint Cup instead of Xfinity.<br><br>The challenges are rather underwhelming. The Talladega one starts you in the front and simply has you hold off the field for a very, very long duration of laps, which is rather dull. The Charlotte one is more exciting, pitting you against the other members of Joe Gibbs Racing, but it's not too hard to simply slingshot to the front of the pack early and turn laps uninterrupted. Kills a bit of time at the least.<br><br>Finally, his spotter pack is fully competent. The abysmal audio quality of a few previous packs is a non-issue here, coming through nice and clear. The volume is a bit scattered, some lines louder than others, but for the most part he's calm and coherent. A slight mumble and unchanged tone don't show much enthusiasm on his part, but if you absolutely must have someone other than Bobby Labonte right now, he's a fine enough fit.<br><br>In short, it's a neat little pack of extras putting the spotlight on a driver that wouldn't otherwise have it in a Sprint Cup game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28332248', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28332248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28332248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28332248' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28332248\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28332248', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28332248_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28332248_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28332248"]}
