Now, this game pulls it off, straight forward turn based strategy game without any fillers or unnecessaty complexity.<br><br>I recommend this game because it is easy to pick up yet shares a similar mastery approach like chess. You control a fleet on a tiled board against another fleet. Each ship has a move pattern and attack pattern, some stronger others weaker. I played a game session for over 30 minutes because I took my time before each move and in the process learned different tricks watching the enemy AI in action. Learned a lot from it and will try to pull those new moves on my next session. It was fun, tactical, straight forward and has a arcade touch to it. Seems the game has online capabilities, so it will be interesting to play against a human contender.<br><br>The style of the ships remind me of Ikaruga and radiant silvergun. The UX is straight to the point, no complex windows all well desgined and simplistic. All you need is fast to get.<br><br>The mood of the game for some reason reminds me of FTL, probably the soundtrack, or just the feeling of the whole game reminds me of FTL. And that is a good thing.<br><br>I do want to point out, as in today, release day, I noticed some bugs when it comes to selecting the tiles you want to move to. I noticed during your turn transition if you click on a enemy for some reason it shows the enemy move pattern and attack pattern as if you were able to control it, yet can't. I have seen this type of bugs before in this type of games and the team mentioned they are in process of fixing bugs, so that is good they are responsive.<br><br>Eveytime you play is not a wasted game (even offline), you earn experience, until now I haven't leveled up but I will check what improvement I do get for my fleet.<br><br>Besides the  ship selection bug (which I believe is being addressed), I do recommend to make the ship animation cut scenes a bit shorter to keep the momentum. This means each ship teleportation and attack can be a bit faster, and that might help the pace to keep it chess like.<br><br>Overall is a good game with a lot of potential, and quality, it will keep improving.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22295616', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22295616' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22295616\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22295616' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22295616\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22295616', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22295616_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22295616_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22466760\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7e\/7e13a213e3cb107bbaf2f3adda9d77996b44f6d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101966371\">Warwick J.<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/games\/?tab=all\">4,672 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/\">269 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Gamephasis\/recommended\/454780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI write this feature a week and a half after the Batu Games's Steam debut of Atriage. The score as it currently stands is 1-0. One Steam review. One. Many worse games garner significantly greater attention from the faithful players on Steam. If it were just the lack of trading cards I could understand but I fear that this game has been hidden. I fear it may have been hidden among all of the VR hype upon its release because this game deserves your attention.<br><br>Atriage is a turn-based strategy game that has been based upon classic board games and brought to life as a video game. The player commands a fleet of warships in order to defeat their opponent. It feels a little like an advanced version of Battleship but the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. The player is tasked with defeating an opposing commander by forcing them to lose BSP (Battle Strength Points) with both starting at 12 and the winner determined by who gets their opponent to zero first. It comes down to a battle of employing the best strategy. Each player starts with ten ships from four different classes with each of the four having their ow different movement and attack patterns with each having unique strengths and weaknesses. Each ship also comes equipped with a shield. <br><br>The game board comprises 84 accessible spaces with 5 obstacles appearing at the start of battle to hinder both players. These obstacles can often prove the difference in a battle and it is up to the player to determine how to best utilize these obstacles as a strength in their gameplay. Smarter players will find them to be a real asset rather than an obstacle.<br><br>You don't necessarily have to destroy your opponent's ships in order to win the game. Yes, it does help but if you damage your opponent's ships you'll still get that point. There are relatively easy ways for you to score early points in the game such as using Silverwind and Typhoon class ships to do damage. In fact, in the game's tips there is a suggestion that you don't want to completely destroy enemy ships early but rather put them into a position where they can be destroyed and then retreat. Another important tip to consider is that you should be using multiple ships in combination rather than employing strategies for each ship that isn't working with any other ship. It's a complex learning process but once you get to grips with the game will become second nature. <br><br>Arguably one of the game's weaknesses, although the game has been designed that way, is that early ascendancy often leads to a snowballing effect. Games can and often are determined by the earliest actions in the game.  While a victory is not guaranteed after a good start if you continue to employ intelligent strategy you will find that this happens a little too often with the game becoming easier. Another weakness that I discovered was with the computer's AI. This is particularly pertinent at lower levels where the computer will move its ships into spaces where you can attack it without fear of retaliation because its ship will still not be in a position to attack yours. I have yet to play the online multiplayer mode because sadly there has never been any matches to join in the numerous times that I have attempted to find one. I have also created my own rooms without any luck of finding an opponent.<br><br>Atriage does have Steam achievements and is a very solid game in need of a player base. I recommend it for those of you who are looking for a new turn-based strategy experience. Hopefully the community picks up for it. However, it may take some bundling for it to happen.<br><br>For awesome giveaways and more gaming stuff check out <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/<\/a><br>Join in the fun on our <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Steamified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Steam Group<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22466760', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22466760' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22466760\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22466760' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22466760\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22466760', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22466760_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22466760_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23751830\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fri_freeman\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"65234628\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cdad82f705b3ba49ac77db1f734b88280a23ad36.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cdad82f705b3ba49ac77db1f734b88280a23ad36.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cd\/cdad82f705b3ba49ac77db1f734b88280a23ad36_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fri_freeman\/\" data-miniprofile=\"65234628\">fri_freeman<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fri_freeman\/games\/?tab=all\">244 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fri_freeman\/recommended\/\">68 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/fri_freeman\/recommended\/454780\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's basically CHESS!
