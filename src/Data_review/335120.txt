A little different, but different is definitely good.  It reminds me of when I was younger and get a new game, like Darklands, Dark Sun, Wiz 7, or Realms of Arkania, and I had to take my time and figure out the rules and not know what was going to happen.  We have kind of been indoctrinated now to know our hands will be held and we can just click through everything or not worry about the character development system because gimping your character is impossible and combat is mindless.  This game gives me that feeling I had when I was younger and installed a new crpg and I knew it was meaty and I had to think and plan and take my time to figure things out.  <br><br>Graphics are not the best, but the gameplay and mechanics more than make up for it.  <br><br>RtwP combat almost always sucks, but isn't too bad in this game.  I think it is done a lot better than Pillars of Eternity and the IE games at least.<br><br>I give it an 8\/10 since it doesn't have TB combat.<br><br>I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes real crpgs in general; anyone who liked the Infinity Engine games or NWN; or, for more recent examples, anyone who liked Pillars of Eternity, D:OS, M&amp;MX, or WL2.<br><br><br>EDIT:  Just some more information on the game.  It has old school puzzles, such as from the original Quest for Glory 1 and 2 (where you had to type all commands), where you have an object in game that you know does something, but you have no idea how to go about getting it to do what it was made to do.  For instance, (slight spoiler ahead) there is a ring of purple flowers.  If you use your woodlore skill on it you find that a fairy is trapped inside by magic.  There is a linguistic system where you type a prefix, power word, and the object of the spell.  This system may have an effect on it, or not.  Or maybe you need two skill points in linguistics?  Who knows?  Not me.  It could be something completely different.  I would have said yesterday I love things like this where you have to think and put your brain against the game, but I'm finding I'm a lot more impatient than I was when I first played QfG and this game is making me feel stupid.  And there are no walkthroughs.  I do think this is a great aspect of the game, but I kind think it is also kind of infuriating.  I'm kind of obsessive and I am having a real hard time leaving the first outside area because there are two things I haven't been able to figure out.  <br><br>If I were normal I would just add some notes in the jounral and come back later, but I'm not, and after work I plan on showing these puzzles who is boss.  Sadly, there is a good chance I'm not the boss.   though.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16047447', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16047447' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16047447\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16047447' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16047447\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16047447', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16047447_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16047447_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t136 of 146 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18349735\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">pepsimanvsjoe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,487 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/\">244 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">22.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 5, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThese days, even mere mortals are more than awesome enough to do everything in spectacular fashion. Take Skyrim for example, everybody needs your help, you always have the capabilities to solve every task, and within hours you become strong enough to singlehandedly kill dragons. Along with this unparalleled power, players enjoyed countless luxuries, such as dozens of quest indicators, as well as arrows that point out exactly where to go and who to talk to. Serpent in the Staglands takes an approach that gamers have either long forgotten, or never even knew existed. <br><br>You are the all-powerful Moon Lord, or were I should say. Someone or something has trapped you in the mortal realm. When you start off, all you're given are some directions, papers identifying you as a merchant, and the assistance of a few allies. Before long, you will face your first great adversary, a wolf. Starting off in this game reminds me of the first <i>Baldur's Gate<\/i>. In that RPG, you started off at level 1, and even the weakest creatures led to life or death struggles. In the beginning of my adventure, I summoned an ethereal ally, and requested the help of a couple of others. Our party of four was no match for a few wolves.<br><br>We all need a little help sometimes, but this game won't provide any. Aside from the always handy ability to save anywhere , you're on your own. Actually, I take that back. You're also given a journal so you can jot down any and all notes. Yes, if you come across a quest, you should write it down along with all pertinent information, because you might forget. Another aspect to keep in mind is that alongside combat and magic skills, there are also certain talents you should be training. With up to five party members, there is room to specialize, so you'll want someone that can speak to nobles, another that will brew potions, the one guy who can understand old texts, and so on. As you explore the Staglands, you'll meet others willing to join your &quot;cause&quot;. It's worth swapping allies around, as they can have better stats as well as mastery of different skill-sets. Failing to do this could have disastrous results. <br><br>Speaking of disastrous results, early on combat can be especially difficult. Like <i>Baldur's Gate<\/i>, this game employs a &quot;real-time with pausing&quot; system. By pressing the space bar, you can pause everything, giving you ample time to issue orders, prepare spells, and pray to the RNG deities. One of the main aspects where Serpent in the Staglands differentiates itself, is in the magic system. Spell-casting is infinite; you are not limited by points nor the need to rest and recharge. However, there is a charge time for everything, and most spells require that you maintain the cast, possibly for the duration of the battle. This simplifies things somewhat, since you can designate one of your party-members as &quot;the tank&quot; and channel all of your healing and stat-boosting spells to them. However, just because it's easy to learn spells, won't make you effective casters. If the enemies are too strong, the spells will fail to do anything. In fact, I've seen some of my foes not even notice my presence, despite everyone in my party channeling curses at them.<br><br>You'll likely find yourself relying on physical combat. Each party-member is capable of learning several combat techniques, although only three can actually be used at a time. These arts of war &quot;proc&quot; after so many swings of a sword or firings of a crossbow. With the right combination of party members and skills, you can do more damage as well as inflict numerous debilitating effects on your foes. In my play-through, I had two characters using shield-bash. This skill can knock enemies down for a couple seconds. There wasn't much the toughest enemy could do against this onslaught. All skills are strengthened via points incurred upon leveling up. As with AD&amp;D, level-ups are few and far between, so you have to make the most of them. By the time I completed the game, my level had barely crossed into the double-digits. <br><br>There are other methods for dealing with hostility. Traps can be set to damage as well as impede enemy forces. This is all but required for handling the dreaded crawlers, who can kill party-members in 1-2 hits. Most enemies can also be lured out with ranged weapons or curses, in case your party can only handle one at a time. Admittedly, I've also foregone the pleasantries and sought the first strike when dealing with some people. There are a few crowds of bandits who attack all at once after a short verbal exchange. Rather than get torn to pieces by archers, I lured everyone out one at a time with missile weapons of my own. It's a cheap method, but considering how heavily the odds are stacked in the game's favor... <br><br>Bringing up a party from nothing, and the growing pains that go along with it, is one of the more compelling aspects of this game. The story is mostly in the background, and you might find yourself stumbling over plot-important NPCs in unlikely places. Most of your vacation in the horrid Staglands, will be spent exploring, getting a feel for the world, and using your talents to find solutions for various side-quests. There is a strong element of non-linearity, and play-throughs can be pretty different from one another, depending on how you handle every situation. I've noticed that my lack of diplomacy and understanding of foreign languages has led to a number of closed-doors. There is a sizable population of natives inhabitating the peninsula, but if you can't speak their language, then it's just more enemies to do battle with. <br><br>Still, there are moments that I can only describe as &quot;lovingly obtuse&quot;. Certain events will happen, and you'll get to thinking that there's more to the story, but nothing comes of it. It's difficult to explain without resorting to spoilers, but let's just say that not all threads will resolve in a suitable fashion. There are also a couple puzzles where you will struggle with game mechanics (such as placing objects on pressure-plates). It helps to pay attention to the notes you acquire. Keep in mind also that something can be useless in the area you acquire it, but could be relevant in a location several miles away. There are actually not that many conversations to be had in this game. Most of the settlers aren't interested in gossip, and the dialogue trees have few (if any) branches. Sometimes you just have to read between the lines, and maybe fill in the blanks with whatever sounds good. On the bright side, the dialogue is well-done, and the bits of world-building are nicely handled.<br><br>The one major problem I have with this game is all the time spent staring at a loading screen. This can be especially grating early on, due to all the reloads caused by exceptionally squishy party-members. Serpent in The Staglands is also shockingly resource-heavy. The pixel-graphics have their charm, but there's nothing here that should demand such a large chunk of my PC's power. On the bright side, my adventure in the Staglands was mostly bug-free, with disappearing guards during some quicksaving shenanigans being the only outlier. <br><br>While not without its faults, Serpent in the Staglands is an ambitious and engrossing RPG. Considering that it was developed by two people, I'm rather surprised it turned out as well as it did. The main quest is on the shorter side, but there are a number of ways to play through the game, and there's plenty of freedom in terms of character builds and party organization. An expansion is currently in-development, so fans can expect to see more of Vol eventually. All in all, this is a worthwhile title for genre veterans as well as players who tire of having everything handed to them.<br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18349735', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18349735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18349735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18349735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18349735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18349735', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18349735_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18349735_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t102 of 114 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16555359\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/58466197\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"37365140\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8bd4249262ec899ffad3bb61afadbd2345f53ca.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8bd4249262ec899ffad3bb61afadbd2345f53ca.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8bd4249262ec899ffad3bb61afadbd2345f53ca_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/58466197\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37365140\">Honey the Sugarglider<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/58466197\/games\/?tab=all\">733 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/58466197\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/58466197\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">36.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a beautifully crafted game, I truly regret I didn't hear of this when it was on Kickstarter.<br><br>So, Serpent in the Staglands is a CRPG made by 2 people, a couple, who are pretty amazing at what they do. One makes art that is in the same style of old 90s games aesthetically, and the other creates the assets\/rules\/codes like some wizard determined to bring out a really great game.<br><br>For the game itself; it is truly a throwback to the old immersive RPG's from the 90s, no quest markers, nothing to hold your hand and only you and your characters actual knowledge of what is around you. It treats you like a normal human, one with normal situational comprehension, deduction, forethought and reasoning.<br><br>Writers for characters in videogame has most of the time complained that romances is the last thing they write, as it mostly reminds them of bad writing in literature. And it mostly is since it adds nothing to the depth of the character. You will see none of it in Serpent in the Staglands since it tries, like many non-romancable RPG's of the time - to be a respectable game. <br><br>The game has a classless system where you decide for yourself what you want your character to use or become, on its own it opens up many unique opportunities; to roleplay as someone else if that is your thing; since the game has a ton of skills to choose from. (I myself made a Castlevania-esque inspired vampire slayer - whip and all kinds of thrown stuff and holy magic). Like many old games it relies on the player to -be- their character, no logs to backtrack quest progress, no mystical magical map of the whole world that pinpoints your exact position or holding your hand towards your &quot;next&quot; location. It wants you to explore the world on your own, find letters, find someone elses journal\/diary about what or where they were, mystical tomes of ancient knowledge, understanding why everyone is so hostile. By listening to what everyone has to say, everything is not what it seems and you really can't trust anyone and have to craft your story based on who you believe to speak the most truths; when every single character you meet in the game has some sort of agenda.<br><br>It's no wonder that this game is not vastly more popular amongst people, as it foregoes a lot of the common &quot;comforts&quot; of modern AAA rpg titles of letting the player think as little as possible or treat them as if they aren't intelligence enough to know what to do or where to go. <br><br>The ones who will love truly love this game are those that had to treck the harsh journeys that old games had, or feel like you are being undervalued in modern games and underestimates how much you truly know. There is a lot of reading involved and nothing to hold your hand and this causes it to lose out on people who seeks a more streamlined experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16555359', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16555359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16555359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16555359' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16555359\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16555359', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16555359_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16555359_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t82 of 96 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>25 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16047986\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"78276785\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab33e6b1ecaeaaf349e835b46a2cc15ea6fa843f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/\" data-miniprofile=\"78276785\">The King in Yellow<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/games\/?tab=all\">274 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/\">39 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038542513\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is delivering on the promise.

You are left ,as a fallen god, to wander with only a few supply and companions you can recruit in unknown and strange landscapes . <br><br>You are free to go wherever you want with ,just given a vague guideline by your head clergy , then it\u2019s up to you, no hand holding , no quest log. Explore chat to npc discover new locations ala fallout, solve clever puzzle and do some dungeonering with real time with pause combat. <br>There\u2019s character creation, stats, attributes, lot of it, very good writing and good lore .So its really back to what pc rpg really where if not more . If you liked darklands , Ultimas, if those name rings a bell this game is for you. <br><br>It\u2019s a game done by only two guys yet I had lot of fun playing this, quite impressive what they could do with a meager 28k$ budget . The game had a rough start cause of bugs wich might explain the low scores , but they are patching surprisingly fast and listening to feedback. <br><br>As of today I can say the game is mostly bug free , and completely playable.

darken it down, with a really bleak and atmospheric feel, make it isometric with a hardcore D&amp;D\/Baulders Gate  character creation, add in some really interesting features, like in game note taking, writing incantations, making inscriptions, spice selling, and you will get serpent in the staglands. a seemingly open ended CRPG with a bleak feel, paused based combat, lots of exploration, lots of stuff to read (and dont think for a second you can get away with not reading pretty much everything in the game, and then taking note based on that reading), lots of lore, lots of choice. recommended for any hardcore RPG player, isometric fans, CRPG enthusiasts along the lines of icewind\/baulders gate. if you get angry at losing or having to start from your last save, if you are impatient, if you want an instantly accessable adventure, if you want handholding, then go elsewhere. this is for the rpg grognards.\t\t\t\t\t<div

hardcore RPGS, this is the game for you! Its becoming one of my favs along with Lords of Xulima, PoE, D:OS and the classics like Planescape &amp; Baldurs Gate. If you want handholding, go elsewhere. Its a little buggy right now, but it being patched as I type this, so I'll remove this line if it gets better.<br>____________________________<br>This is possibly the coolest game Ive stumbled across recently since finding Lords of Xulima. I've been disparing as Steam slowly seems to be swallowed up by Google Play-esq crap casual mobile ports. <br><br>Not this game. Its an RPG for RPG lovers. Its done in a pseudo-1990s (like 1995 or so) pixelated style, with cutscenes being done in something that looks very similar to that era's FMV. Its really great so far. <br><br>Ive played literally hundreds if not thousands of RPGs in my 34 years, and after a while they seem very similar. Elves, dwarves, halflings, forests and quests, deserts, dungeons, dragons etc etc ad naseum. <br><br>Well this one starts out with an Ultima like fortune teller asking you questions. Then apparently, you are a god who got stuck in the mortal world and must take a mortal form. It then goes into character creation...and the races are all unique! No humans. No elves (pseudo or otherwise - they all have pointy ears, so maybe they're all elves?), no dwarves. Just unique races. Awesome. Even Pillars of Eternity didnt do it this well, as I would have called their races just a slightly different take on &quot;traditional&quot; races.<br><br>Hoping the rest of the game pans out as well as the little Ive seen so far. I'll be updating as I go.<br><br>Hm, so I started out, made two chars (this is a &quot;create your own group or find NPCS&quot; like PoE). I immediately found a book which allowed me to use the mouse to draw symbols on it. Cool, I love interactive stuff (The Room series is one of the few mobile games I'm into).  I screwed around and SOMEHOW drew the right symbol on the 4th try.

Gone are the arrows of patronization, the quest log, the terrible bland puzzles that a brain dead toddler could figure out, and in is a true return to form of open world crpgs bursting at the seams with love and attention to detail. For a game made by a team of two people, it is one of the gaming masterworks of this decade in my eyes.<br><br>The Bad:<br>1. At the time of playing, many small errors in displayed item statistics, skill descriptions, and other details were littered here and there. However, the new patches seem to be ironing out all of these typos and issues.<br><br>2. Lack of sound variation is something that detracts from immersion in combat. There are painfully few sound effects for all the various spells and weapons. Two spells that have wildly different effects generally ought to have wildly different sounds, if sound is to be an integral feature to add to them.<br><br>3. For those that love magic, know that it will take many points of investment to be an effective full time mage. It is simply part of the flavor of the setting, not necessarily a mark against the game, but it could put off those that chose this path for their first playthrough.<br><br>4. The technical - loading times and video resolution - The loading times were very slow when I played through the game, making every death even more painful. Just because I want a crpg like those released in the late 90's doesn't mean I want a resolution like what they had. The game is beautiful but the constant close up feeling can wear on the senses after a while, at least for me.<br><br>The Good:<br>1. The story is a simple, yet strong premise. You are a god somehow locked into the mortal coil possessing a flesh and blood avatar. If you die in your current form you will be swept out of existence like any other mortal. Your quest is to get home, while finding out who put you into this situation and exacting your vengeance if you wish.<br><br>2. Incredibly sculpted world with a smorgasbord of lore that you can dig out with relatively little effort. The setting is dark, internally realistic, and all settlements and people are logically and lovingly placed. On many items, from the mundane to incredible artifacts, are paragraphs of flavor text to become immersed in.<br><br>3. Almost all the quests are unique, memorable, can be done at any time, and usually have a myriad of solutions. Some solutions can have unforeseen consequences that tie into the world much more intricately than a simple &quot;bumbleton reputation +5&quot;<br><br>Also gone is the arrow of patronization, waypoints, or even a quest tracker. In SitS you have a journal in which you can manually write down all information you find relevant and wish to remember.<br><br>4. There are a plethora of skills, both combat related and not, for crafting many different types of characters. The skills are separated into Combat Skills (or the War Book), Magic (the Spell Book), and Aptitudes. Combat and Magic skills are varied and all serve some purpose that can be exploited in game, even if some are much stronger than others. The Aptitudes are things ranging from Herbology, Nobility, and even Philosophy amongst others. All of these have uses beyond immediate combat benefit, allowing the player access to more dialogue options and other ways of overcoming obstacles. One great use for Philosophy involves befriending imps and using their malicious powers to steal stats from another character and gift them to the player permanently.<br><br>5. Challenging puzzles. In too many games, especially in the last decade, the hardest puzzle is putting together that the '321' on the scrap of paper is the combination to the safe - or that mural on the wall displays the animals in the order that you need to put the emblems. Asinine busy work like that doesn't pass for puzzles in SitS. When the game presented me with a puzzle, I was deciphering the numerical code and language of an alien people. I was reading journals for the vaguest hints of a magical enchantment that required manipulating pillars of flame to cast their shadows to spell them out. These tasks pull you into the game world instead of the immersion breaking alternatives and minigames many games go with today.<br><br>6. Quick, deadly combat. Ignore the people saying the game is insanely difficult. It's not. These people expect a mere mortal with little training to take on a wolf, or even pack of wolves, with a kitchen knife and consistently come out on top. The Damage dished out make fights generally short affairs. Having a party member knocked to the floor or stricken with magical fear can sour any battle into defeat. This applies equally to your enemy - knock an enemy down and watch your melee fighters smash them into jello in a laughable amount of time. Think tactically and use and trick you can to gain an upper hand.<br><br>The only complaint I have against the combat system is there being no zone of control. Enemies can merely walk past the fighters and into the back lines if they wish. This isn't so much a problem as long as you learn to engage with melee first, or set traps to effectively kite enemies easier.<br><br>7. The sound design is top notch. Both music and sound effects are of great quality, if lacking in variety. The music that plays in the bogs is especially haunting.<br><br>8. The art direction is absolutely amazing. Even though pixels and the 'neo-retro' \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t is old hat, the style of the game and the limits of having a two person studio do not work against the visual side of SitS.<br><br>The Great:<br>The entire game. I can't gush about it enough, but I've tried to present as unbiased an opinion I can over it. If you're still on the fence after watching trailers and reviews I'd say wait until more news of the planned expansion to see what that adds as well as what they've patched to the base game in the interim.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17032774', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17032774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17032774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17032774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17032774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17032774', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17032774_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17032774_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16491759\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979200397\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"18934669\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c1\/c1ce41edc6c68b51fc8644317e1cdf50c69779f1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c1\/c1ce41edc6c68b51fc8644317e1cdf50c69779f1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c1\/c1ce41edc6c68b51fc8644317e1cdf50c69779f1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979200397\/\" data-miniprofile=\"18934669\">decorum est<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979200397\/games\/?tab=all\">248 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979200397\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197979200397\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">48.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMade by a two person team for gamers longing for the normal difficulty of the old school without window dressing or streamlining.

Often times, at least during this first section at the beginning of the game, you sort of having to manipulate the system by slowly attracting enemies one by one out of a room or area and defeating them. However, I did play enough to realize that each new dungeon provides ample opportunities to grow your characters and level-up. By the end of the first dungeon, for example, I was taking on whole teams of enemies when at the beginning I sheepishly fought them one by one. The combat in general is fair and the magic and non-magic systems make sense, however, it may be unbalanced. I would think the developer wouldn't want to make the player feel the need to game the system and fight creatures one by one when they clearly intended the player to fight a party of people all at once. Still, the world is overall intriguing and well realized and the combat is more than competent enough to be entertaining. There is a &quot;hard core&quot; aspect in that you have to keep your own journal entries, but they couldn't have made this easier thanks to a log system that keeps past dialogue for a long period of time. Often, important information is repeated in conversations. There's really no reason for you to get lost or confused unless your completely incompetent. It makes keeping your own records and journal entries fun instead of a chore. <br><br>The only reason I'm probably not going to finish this game is because it takes so much time. Combat is paced slowly, you'll die often, and dialog is super detailed - all artificially adding burdensome length to the game. I prefer games that give me a sense of accomplishment sooner than this game. That being said, it's a solid RPG offering and if you were on the fence, as I was, definitely give it a shot. Just make sure you have ample free time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28672195', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28672195' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28672195\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28672195' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28672195\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28672195', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28672195_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28672195_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26031408\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198046341669\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"86075941\">snowfrost571<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 40.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 14, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI liked this game.  Figuring out which combat\/magic\/lore skills to develop in order to form an effective adventuring party was a big draw for me.  The experimentation was definitely rewarding.  Meeting the world's characters and delving into the lore made it feel really immersive for me.<br><br>Not everything is perfect, however.  I found it difficult to get through the beginning stages of the game against the steep learning curve.  As other reviewers have noted, there is no hand holding.  So in the beginning I died a lot.  Experimenting with the different options (combat\/magic\/lore) were key to overcoming this obstacle.<br><br>Some of the puzzles in the game force you into certain solutions that are not intuitive.  For instance, you may want to use your diplomacy skills to encourage an enemy that is perfectly willing to talk to you to go to a different area, but the dialogue options will force you to encourage the enemy to go to a town and cause problems there.  Maybe encouraging an enemy to go to a town to cause problems is part of a larger quest that I did not become involved in, and then the reasoning would make sense.  Again, as other reviewers have noted, there is no hand holding, tutorial, or hint system.  Another time, I needed to get to a certain area within a civilized area.  I pumped points into various skills, but no dialogue options appeared so I could resolve this peacefully.  I eventually resorted to killing civilians and guards until I got what I wanted.  It is possible that my skills simply weren't high enough, but there is no way for me to know that during the game.<br><br>Bottom line, I still recommend this game.  There were enough reviews on this game that I knew what I was getting into and the challenges I would face.  The learning curve can be overcome with fun experimentation, and the satisfaction of overcoming that is rewarding.  I can gloss over some of the non-intuitive solutions due to the fascinating world-building that the creators put their hearts into.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26031408', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26031408' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26031408\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26031408' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26031408\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26031408', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26031408_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26031408_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short25406591\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tulu6\/recommended\/335120\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"75607549\">tulu<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 46.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAwesome cRPG, love it.

But beyond that layer of nostalgic graphics and game-design Serpent in the Staglands is one of the greatest RPGs in recent years.<\/i><br><br>Old-school is en vogue when it comes to roleplaying. Between Pillars of Eternity, Torment and Divinity we see more and more RPGs with turn-based combat, extensive character-creation and -developement, many hours of gameplay and focus on story and worldbuilding. But few have the balls to go as far as Whalenought Studios. This is truly a throwback to a time where RPGs did value the player's ability to figure things out on their own. You will have to write your questlog yourself (there is an ingame function for that), dive headfirst into the magic-system that is a far cry from usual and think about how you tackle the tasks and quests given to you beforehand. If this doesn't sound appealing for you, don't buy this game. You WILL need all of this if you want to finish the adventure. If it does, you are in for an amazing ride.<br><br>The combat is real-time with pause, meaning that your party attacks in real-time, but you can pause the game at every second during combat to give commands, cast spells or use items. People who have played the old Infinity Engine-games, Pillars of Eternity or KotOR will already be familiar with this system. Only spells work a little bit different here; every spell has to be channeled, meaning every spell is essentially a buff or debuff. Some spells heal continously, some shield, some drain hitpoints. Only one spell per caster can be active at every given time, so you better plan ahead. Sadly, most of the time this system is reduced to healing-spells because those are by far the most convenient way to get through combat. Just load up your healing ray and you're good to go. The puzzles are a mixed bag, too; they range from \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t to great, from too difficult to just right. <br><br>Decisions matter. Seriously. We are not talking Mass Effect here. We are talking about losing entire settlements because every singe inhabitant was eaten by monsters if you make the wrong decisions (or were they?). We are talking about a system of virtuosity that reminds a bit of Ultima IV. The story is good - it is low-key, dark and personal. Essentially, you are a god trapped in the world of the mortals after a night of partying with your followers, because an unknown entity has closed the portal to your homeworld. You have to find your way back home, so you recruit a bunch of followers and trek from one corner to the world to the other and back again. Don't expect epic cutscenes or great emotions; most of the story is told in a calm, textbook-like way. But it is interesting, engaging and twists wonderfully over the course of the game.<br><br>The graphics are good. They were made by hand with obvious amounts of love, the portraits are great and the character-models look amazing. Sadly, the animations are wonky at best and the environment could have benefitted from a less modular design. Still, a good sense for aesthetics shows in every nook and corner. The world itself is cold and bleak. The climate is harsh, and the people are even harsher. Don't expect a warm welcome, neither from the game nor from the people who inhabit it's world. The creatures are weird and creative and the entire world is shrouded in fog of mystery. All of this goes hand in hand with the gameplay and create a constant feeling of uncertainity and fear. <br><br>But the game is not without it's flaws. The loading-times were atrocious when I played it. You will die often, which makes matters even worse. There could have been more different events on the world-map. Why was my party lured into the same trap by a bunch of Imps dozens of times during their adventure? Why didn't they learn the lesson, say, the tenth time or so? The sound is okay, but nothing to write home about. The last twist at the ending feels kind of weird and tacked on, even if it is not as bad as in Pillars of Eternity. Weapons are interesting, but lack in variety, same for armors. <br><br>Still, Serpent in the Staglands does a lot right - in fact, far more than many of the other recent isomentric old-school RPGs. Because it doesn't make compromises. Every difficulty you face has it's purpose and place in the world. The gameplay is harsh, the world is harsh, the adventure is harsh. But in the end, it is bloody satisfiying.<br><br><i>tl;dr: Serpent in the Staglands decided to be the 100% brutal, no compromise, no handholding OG-option when it comes to recent &quot;old-school&quot; RPGs. If you don't have the patience to learn it you probably won't finish it. But if you do, you are in for hidden gem with nice graphics, okay sound, some minor flaws in combat and technical issues, that can scores with an engaging story full of hard decicions with real consequences and overall great gameplay.<\/i> <br><br><b>!
