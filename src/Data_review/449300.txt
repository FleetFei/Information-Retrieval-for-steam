Instead I will focus on the ONE thing which holds this gem back, the interface!<br><br>Following my petpeeves:<br>-This is the first game where I DON'T use the minimap (orientation of minimap is 45\u00b0 offset with regard to mainview, making my head hurt, so not helping but confusing)-this NEEDS change, rotating minimap should do the trick<br>-Much information is buried at least one mouseclick away...I want to see what spell I research, if I am making an item, and which spell I am casting in my mainview!!! Especially finding out which spell is being cast at the moment is not easily found if you load a save for example)<br>-Spell management looks nice but fails when I want to cancel select enchantments, and I can't seem to find an option of canceling enchantments on units(it is nicely done in cities, but apparently not for units...so you end up guessing and cancel of course the wrong enchantment-not the troop you are phasing out but your main one etc...)<br>-Resources are often NOT readily apparent, so I end up mousing over each tile, trying to find if there is anything (Quicksilver, Bonyard and Darkwood are some examples I tend to miss)-As I understand that making callouts to each resource will kill the (admittedly beautiful) graphics, maybe it is possible to modify the settlement radar (F2-which shows how many people can live where) with also showing icons for resources under the citycross-similar to the ones in the citywindow)?<br>-I want to be able to cancel EVERY window with rightclicking outside of it, some you can, some you can't (like city window) <br>-WorldSpellbook NEEDS another two tabs, city and unit enchantments, especially lategame current interface needs FAR too many actions to find wanted spells<br>-CombatSpellbook could also do with preselection of spells shown (mimimum two categories: a)target own troops b)target enemy troops) ...especially rainbow sorceror lords need far too many clicks looking to find the proper spells...and I find myself often choosing rainbow lords)<br>-Spellcasting during combat NEEDS to either have a hotkey for the final cast command or double click be enabled, one or the other...<br>-During Combat abilitiesmenu of units NEEDS a shortcut key...mousing over and then clicking the (fist?)icon EVERYtime I want to cast a spell or activate sneak etc gets old quick<br>-City management especially late game with 15+ cities NEEDS an overview window, which lists only mainstuff (Gold-Power-Research-Food-NegEnergy-Hammer income,current production, icons for special resources (like mithril, adamantium, boneyard and darkwood))  <br>-Gamestart NEEDS a regenerate map function with chosen options on the first turn (I want to play challenging games due to strong opponents, not due to a bad start on a wrong plane)<br>-Start screens should have a memory function, which starts with same options chosen as the previous game, NOT resetting to standard.<br><br> <br>If these points can be improved, this game WILL take off. Currently too many people will look and stop playing after a few hours, as it's just too clunky. <br>So my recommendation is still a yes, but with strong reservations. <br><br>Edit:<br>-Roadbuilding NEEDS a &quot;Build Road to&quot; feature, moving engineer to next square after having finished one square gets old really fast<br>-Unitcommands like &quot;fortify&quot;, &quot;split army&quot;, &quot;build road&quot; etc. NEED hotkeys\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30788377', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30788377' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30788377\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30788377' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30788377\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30788377', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30788377_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30788377_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23385740\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Mhaeric\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"82227550\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2ccba62117b9dba688c85b71e22c75f023ff3450.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2ccba62117b9dba688c85b71e22c75f023ff3450.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2c\/2ccba62117b9dba688c85b71e22c75f023ff3450_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Mhaeric\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82227550\">mhaeric<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Mhaeric\/games\/?tab=all\">167 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Mhaeric\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Mhaeric\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">35.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 4, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have easily put at least 1000 hours into Master of Magic over the years since I first opened the huge purple box with an eye on it almost 20 years ago. Likely far more. The Prima strategy guide was my bible. Since then, I've been looking for a game that is worthy of being called a sequel or successor to that game, but have had no luck.<br><br>Until now.<br><br>A single player turn-based 4x strategy game, most similar in style to the Age of Wonders series, it focuses on empire building by building cities through expansion and conquering. You take on the persona of a Sorcerer Lord vying for complete control over all the planes of existence. There is a detailed character creation process which lets you decide your Sorceror Lord's abilities and spell knowledge, and this has a huge impact on your game's playstyle. Unlike most empire games, your persona takes a very active role in shaping your empire, making the spells you know a very large part of the focus of the game. There are two possible win conditions: defeat your foes by completely destroying their cities, or cast the ultimate magic spell granting you dominion over everything.<br><br>Things I loved from Master of Magic that are still here:<br>- A huge variety of spells with a lot of customization for your wizard. This makes every game you create play very differently.<br>- The feel of the game is the same. I realize this is subjective, but it really does feel like I'm playing a game in the same series made by the same developers. The pacing feels the same. The variety of customization options, while greatly expanded, feel like they're a natural extension of the original options. The controls are very familiar. Other games I've played that have tried to modernize Master of Magic have failed at this.<br>- Combat is just as strategic and varied. I can't tell you how many hours I spent poring over the strategy guide figuring out to-hit and damage numbers.<br>- The surveyor tool. This thing is just amazing.<br>- Tool tips. For everything. This was a HUGE deal 20 years ago when this game first came out, and still is to this day.<br><br>Things they've added that improve the game:<br>- Customization. They added the concept of grouping spells by effect in addition to element, so now if you want to create a Destruction wizard or a Summoning wizard then you can. You can also mix and match elements with effects, so if you really like buffing your units with spells, but also want to be able burn your foes to a crisp then you can put spellbooks into both Augmentation and Fire to get lots of both types of spells, especially fire based augmentation spells. The level of customization this opens up is huge.<br>- Additional planes of existence. Gone are the simple days of Arcana and Myrror. Now, every game can have from 1 to 7 planes of existence. Anything from the prime plane much like our own, to elemental planes of fire or air, to paradise or corruption. Each plane can be separately customized with the type of land mass and it's overall size making the size of your world potentially massive in scale. If you want a short quick game then choose a single plane with a smallish land mass. Want an epic, seemingly endless, plane-spanning battle? Then choose all 7 planes with large landmasses and settle in for the long haul.<br>- UI elements. Most of the UI elements are pretty similar to the original game, which for some means that they'll likely feel a bit dated. There are, however, some more modern elements that have been added which players of the original game will really notice. Most notable of these are the spell storage and favourites features, the auto-explore setting for armies, and the city build queue.<br><br>Things I miss from the original game:<br>- A visual representation of your city in the city window. It was really cool how you could see all the buildings you created show up in your cityscape as you built them. It certainly made cities feel more dynamic as opposed to a list of numbers and stats.<br>- Spell animations. There are spell animations in Planar Conquest, and the battle ones so far are pretty good. The overland ones, however, are not that great. For example, most of the city spells that I cast while out of combat end up having their visual effect hidden beneath the surrounding objects and terrain. The only one I've seen that is visually very apparent is the Strands of Power enchantment. <br>- All of the information windows we used to be able to call up. Primarily the historian and astrologer windows which showed the relative strengths between you and your opponents. Also, I can't find a way to view your enemy wizard's stats yet like you used to be able to do in the diplomacy window.<br><br>All in all, from the perspective of someone who is a huge Master of Magic fan, this game hits all the right buttons. I definitely recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23385740', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23385740' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23385740\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23385740' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23385740\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23385740', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23385740_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23385740_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23336478\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"33141132\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adc1d04962c1440f63f84edf3c69e4fff00709a8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adc1d04962c1440f63f84edf3c69e4fff00709a8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adc1d04962c1440f63f84edf3c69e4fff00709a8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33141132\">Medieval Nerd<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/games\/?tab=all\">382 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/recommended\/\">29 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/vhorthex\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">What is Planar Conquest?<\/div><br>After such a long journey, I think it's good to try and remind ourselves of a few things.<br><br>Firstly, Planar Conquest is visual &amp; interface overhaul of World of Magic. It is not a sequel to WOM. It's basically Worlds of Magic 2.0, reskinned and the interface done over.<br><br>Secondly, Planar Conquest is a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Can this game be considered a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic? <\/div><br>Yes.<br><br>With a new take on the spell book library, the game hits all the markers of Master Of Magic, and takes it a little further without attempting to re-invent the wheel. Something I feel is at the root of the failures of past attempts.<br><br><b>Spells<\/b><br><br>The new School \/ Specialization spell classification is quite interesting. I really like how they all intertwine, and focus on different aspects or playstyles. I was a huge fan of Life magic in MOM, using Stream of Life to crank up some insane income to dominate my opponents. I found that Mentalism was actually a better fit to my playstyle than Life was.<br><br>It's perhaps daunting for newcomers as the sheer amount of spells, and tiers, may make it seem like it takes a while to get a grasp of which school or specialization is the good fit for you. I would suggest you hop on the official forums, and I took the time to write down all the spells within and excel sheet. Where you can easily compare each school\/specialization and get an idea of what combo might be good for you!<br><br>There were a total of 392 Spells based on the latest version of WOM. Each 'school\/specialization' has about 62 spells.<br><br><b>Buildings<\/b><br><br>Perhaps nostalgia played a big role in this, but I was absolutely overjoyed to see that the very building tree was kept nearly intact from MOM. People who are familiar with the building progression of MOM will be right at home.<br><br><b>Races<\/b><br><br>I've been infatuated with Dark Elves for as long as I remember playing MOM. So having them present was quite a treat for me. I was intrigued by the slight slavery twist they gave it, with lowly servants being your base unit. I rather liked that angle they gave them.<br><br>Other race I played were the Undead, and this is probably the race that has the most unique playstyle. Forgoing both food &amp; money, for 'essence'. I haven't given them a whirl in a bit, I'll definitely have to put some time aside for a playthrough with them.<br><br>In the end we don't have as many races as we did in MOM, but I think they spent a bit more time trying to create some nuance between the buildings and units. Whereas MOM each race had the same buildings, with the caveat that some races couldn't build all of them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Is this game for you? <\/div><br>If you've been waiting for something to scratch an itch similar to MOM, than there is a great chance this game is for you.<br><br>If you are looking for something that defies the genre, and forges a new take on Turn Based Strategy, than you might be disapointed. And buyer beware, this was never intended to be anything of the sort. It's meant to give us a 'modernized' MOM, and on those points it's delivered the features and mechanics.<br><br>Sure the game isnt' a feast for the eyes, if you've got issues playing with games that aren't top of the line modeling, animations and sound. You might want to check out some Let's plays first and see if this is your cup of tea. The gameplay is there, it's more of a question to make sure it's what you are looking for.<br><br>In the end, I really feel like this is as close to a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic as we will ever get. And I'm glad a company was able to finally make it happen.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23336478', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23336478' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23336478\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23336478' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23336478\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23336478', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23336478_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23336478_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t72 of 91 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">15 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23294416\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"46307980\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c6812b723adb7d696c9fd9c426d4939f4d6dad0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c6812b723adb7d696c9fd9c426d4939f4d6dad0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c6812b723adb7d696c9fd9c426d4939f4d6dad0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46307980\">cradoi10<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/games\/?tab=all\">30 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006573708\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Planar Conquest for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPRE-Script: I originally backed the game on Kickstarter, and received a copy of planar conquest for free, because I paid more than full price for the game backed on kickstarter and a hero reward, which the team then turned into planar conquest.

What this means, is that every time you cast a spell, a virtual die is cast, and the result is determined by the stats of everything involved. So, casting a fireball on a fire elemental won't mean it will never damage it, but it does mean that it'll be pretty hard to hit it. Consequently, casting the same fireball on a human unit will probably have a much higher chance of sucess.<br><br>- 7 different map types which represent different elemntal planes. You can choose to have all 7 present during a game, and travel freely between them.<br><br>- 8 different races, ranging from the standard high fantasy humans and orcs, to less traditional dragons and hive mind insects. All have different units, and play differently due to racial traits like slow population growth or bonus production in cities.<br><br>- Chose from over 12 or 15 pre-made sorceror lords (basically another layer of customization for your empire) OR create your own,<br><br><br><br>PROs:<br>-GREAT tooltips. Everything has a stat and everything's explained. Never wondered what a spell does.<br><br>- Immense spell, unit, and map diversity. There are dozens, if not close to a hundred some spells, and your sorceror lord dictates whether you'll play a summoner, calling up zombies and elemntals during battles, or if you'll fling fireballs and bolts of necromatic energy. Maybe you'll have a small army of units with 15 blessings each, making them hit harder and faster than your opponents.<br><br>- More polished UI: this one's sort of hard to defend, because the game is a re-release, and while I prefer the old UI personally, the new one is much cleaner.<br><br>- Stayed true to MoM: probaly not a plus for most who haven't played the original, but the sorceror lords and units are a faithful recreation of the original.<br><br><br><br>CONs:<br>- unfortunately, due to the size of the team and massive scope of the project, the battle animations are not on par with the rest of the game's visual polish<br><br>- while I haven't played enough, there was a legitimate problem with the game devolving into a city spam. This is endemic to the MoM system (the original DOS game), but I'm surprised that the developers chose to use such an archaic formula. Cities are carbon copies of each other and usually serve only as military production sites. This isn't civ by any chance, no tiles, but then again, this isn't a Civ game. Apples and Oranges.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TLDR: this is a faithful recreation of the first fantasy 4x that was a commercial sucess, to the best of my knowledge. Despite the game being rough around the edges at times, the sheer level of content, literally almost more than 100 spells, 8+ different units per 8 different races, and a generally staggering amount of army customizations makes this game hard to dislike, as long as you don't expect a deep economic simulator.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>8\/10 for letting me play D&amp;D general.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23294416', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23294416' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23294416\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23294416' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23294416\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23294416', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23294416_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23294416_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23295229\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"47291728\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/632c9c99bf1bb47b9d3c81fc31825f1f1f3ad99b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/632c9c99bf1bb47b9d3c81fc31825f1f1f3ad99b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/63\/632c9c99bf1bb47b9d3c81fc31825f1f1f3ad99b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47291728\">dergefata<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/games\/?tab=all\">410 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007557456\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">26.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShort version:  Planar Conquest is a worthy successor to the venerable Master of Magic.  It uses the same overall formula that made MoM so great, and updates things based on lessons learned in the decades since.  If you've been waiting to see if Wastelands could patch up the buggy Worlds of Magic and make a great game, this is it.  Buy this game.<br><br>Long version:  Most of the gameplay mechanics are either identical or nearly identical to WoM, so if you played that game, consider this a patched up and generally improved version.  The game uses the d20 system, so if you're familiar with that from any of its many appearances in games like KOTOR or the later AD&amp;D CRPGs, then you know exactly how it's all going to work.<br><br>Planar Conquest has all the races you'd expect from a MoM-style game; elves and orcs and dwarves and humans and dragons and undead.  The units are almost identical to the Worlds of Magic roster, which is great, because WoM got a lot right, including the variety and style of monsters.  A few things have been tweaked, but generally speaking, the game feels like an homage to Master of Magic, and you generally get what you'd expect.  Orcs are brute force powerhouses, from their glass cannon basic units up to their durable and deadly Manslayers.  Elves are quick, and the Grey Elves still have the most powerful basic unit in the game, so if you're new to the genre and want to try an easier start, play Grey Elves, place cities on food-generating tiles, and crank out legions of Archers.  Dwarves are tough and productive; Draconians mobile and, though harder to get going than some other races, vastly powerful with their top-tier units.<br><br>The art style has been changed to be a little more colorful, a little more cartoony.  I don't mean that in a bad way - Heroes of Might and Magic 3, one of my favorite games of all time, has a cartoony art style.  Done right (as HoMM3 surely did, and as PC does, also), there's nothing wrong with this art style.  Treasure chests, which dot the map, contain mana, gold, or experience; this also adds a slight HoMM feel to the game.<br><br>The AI is improved, and now poses a bit of a challenge on the highest difficulty levels.  It can also navigate the planes better than it was doing in Worlds of Magic, so you really need to stay alert.<br><br>Speaking of the planes, I love the variety.  Not just the visual difference (though it's great) and not just the functional difference (which is also substantial, from the food-rich Paradise plane to the nearly barren but abundantly gold-generating Earth, or charred Power-soaked fields of Fire), but the fact that there is just so much to explore.  It was great fun in MoM to hop between the Prime and Myrror - that freedom is magnified fourfold with the variety of planes in Planar Conquest.  You can turtle up, block entry at the gateways, and sit in your home plane while you research a win, or you can spread out across the worlds, fighting and befriending other Sorcerer Lords until you win.<br><br>Diplomacy is still a little weak.  The AI still occasionally does things, even on the hardest difficulty, that just aren't good ideas.  I'm not saying this is a perfect game in all respects.  But I'm not finding any bugs, and this is a modern version of Master of Magic that belongs up there with that old classic.  If you loved Master of Magic, or Fallen Enchantress, or Warlock, or Endless Legend, or Worlds of Magic, buy this game.  It's so very worth your time and money.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23295229', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23295229' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23295229\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23295229' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23295229\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23295229', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23295229_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23295229_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23313603\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006917383\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46651655\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/24\/24566e2b3ee69e45d4fa23e783d7b655893ee36e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/24\/24566e2b3ee69e45d4fa23e783d7b655893ee36e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/24\/24566e2b3ee69e45d4fa23e783d7b655893ee36e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006917383\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46651655\">King Doom<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006917383\/games\/?tab=all\">168 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006917383\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006917383\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 31, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Planar Conquest for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, where to start? by talking about a different game, that makes perfect sense.<br><br>Originally there was Master of Magic, and being how it was a very popular game some twenty odd years later people got around to making a sequel, and that happened to be Worlds of Magic. Worlds of Magic was not an amazing game. It wasn't exactly buggy, but it was blatantly half finished. Menus didn't work, scrollbars didn't exist, the entire thing chugged along like a fat man trying to roll up a hill.<br><br>Now we have Planar Conquest, made by the same people who decided to come back for another go. Frankly, the difference between the two games is actually quite scary. The first thing I noticed in Planar Conquest is the fact it goes like a stabbed rat. (For those of you who don't speak South End that means it is very, VERY fast.) My PC isn't exactly modern. Or fast. Or working.  It was forged by Ur-Dwarves from slabs of hand mined Obsidian in the before times. On a good day I can claim that 'it isn't completely on fire'. Planar Conquest however, everythings fast. Starts up, loads saves, processes turns, everything. Compared to Worlds of Magic which ran so slowly windows spent a lot of time convinced it had stopped responding, the difference is incredible. I'm genuinely including some sort of fell sorcery in the list of possible ways they could have gotten it working so well. Quite possibly the machine they used to compile the code for this game is powered by the still beating heart of a forsaken child or something, it's genuinely amazing.<br><br>What does it look like? well, better than its predecessor. Graphics are clearer and easier to make out, it's much simpler to tell what is on the map now, and it also allows you to double click on visible features to see what is inside them and what rewards are possible. Actually, we'll just move onto the game menu's because yeah, everything I just said goes for them to. Clear, responsive, easy to use and navigate, it's all nicer. There's more stuff in the city screen, but that's because they sorted everything into its own section which works better. I also haven't seen anything with missing or broken descriptions yet, something that Worlds of Magic had a great deal of. I'm not going to check because I don't want to spend eight months loading the damn thing, but you could frequently expect to see fleets of UNIT_BOAT_GAL_01 or something floating by. Not so here. Everything has its own name and suchlike.<br><br>What happens when you actually play though? well, the neutral AI seems much more agressive now - I've had to fight off several armies attacking my city, so no leaving it undefended for hundreds of turns like in a certain other game. I'm not far enough in to have met another Sorceror Lord yet, so I can't say what that'll be like unfortunately. I'll update when I do.<br><br>Are there bugs? Well, the first time I fired the game up a pair of hero units and a cannon I hired vanished into the aether, but that hasn't happened again so fingers crossed that was one of those one in a million bugs and not a 'don't play till it gets fixed one' I haven't run into anything else yet. Oh, and the game has no problems if you tab out to do something else for a bit, like check the interwebnets. Or write a Steam Review.<br><br>Would I reccomend this game? I'm going to cautiously say yes, and then go play some more. Hopefully the only change I get to make later is to remove the word 'cautiously'.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23313603', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23313603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23313603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23313603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23313603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23313603', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23313603_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23313603_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24444721\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10071813\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/09\/0946a7a3ddedc3769582a6477d60bd6079c7e655.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/09\/0946a7a3ddedc3769582a6477d60bd6079c7e655.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/09\/0946a7a3ddedc3769582a6477d60bd6079c7e655_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10071813\">StormbringerGT<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/games\/?tab=all\">679 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/stormbringergt\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">96.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the spiritual sequel to Master of Magic that I have been waiting for.<br><br>A huge selection of Wizards to choose from or you can create your own.

This is basically the same game without the bugs and crashes. When I saw it was being released on May 30th I couldn't wait to finally play the game I bought a year ago without the annoying crashes and bugs. I can say, I was not disappointed. The game runs quite smooth. Of course there's room for improvement but it provides a good gameplay experience.

The letting you know how hard for the highlighted army the attack would be is a good and useful feature.<br>The updated magic is great, many more lores to learn, great spells and enjoyable animations.  7 planes to play on, not that I've played on them all yet....... matter of time.<br><br>The only gripe, and it's a small one, having cast the spell of mastery, the is no end game animation at all.  MOM had you sucking the wizards into the void.  All you get for the hours of work is a table wit hyour score and what creature you're level was.

This game totally took me by surprise. So much fun!! It sucked me in and I found myself in that &quot;just one more turn&quot; mode, just like many of the Civilization games, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Age of Wonders have done in the past for me. There is an awful lot to keep you playing; here's a brief summary:<br><br>- treasure chests with loot dotting the landscape encourage exploration<br>- the different planes<br>- the numerous challenges \/ adventure locations with rewards <br>- the difficulty : for me, just right. Ex: wandering enemies have mixed stacks of units and use the spells \/ skills at their disposal. Your cities are defendable through careful planning, but the wandering monsters remain a challenge throughout the game<br>- heroes and unlockable perks<br>- combat is fun and addictive \/ reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic III with a wide variety of spells and tactical options to explore and discover<br>- researching new spells; weighing the cost vs. reward, immediate vs. long-term benefits<br>-so much potential as well for development and expansions<br><br>I heartily recommend it.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23347128', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23347128' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23347128\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23347128' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23347128\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23347128', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23347128_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23347128_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30005507\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036224762\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"75959034\">csajjj<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinately worth a try.

Insane number of spells with diverse effects? (300+) check. Mechanic of dividing power between research spells\/skill\/mana? Check. Crafting of items? Check. Super customizable wizard setup? Check. You not only get to select the equivalent of &quot;Spell books&quot; and &quot;Retorts&quot; in MOM but also negative &quot;Retorts&quot; (they are called disciplines) like Butcher (+100% additional loss in population when conquering cities) or Ascetic (you cannot store more than 1,000 gold), that gain you picks\/points to add abilities. <br><br>The similarity goes down to the level of spell names and effects. MOM old main stays like web, doombolt, Time stop they are all there.<br><br>It also expands the original game with up to the ability to play with 7 planes. You can customize almost every aspect of the game, from size of lands, whether you get one land mass, a few or many. You can have double movement by default or speed up the game further by speeding up to 4x the speed of researching, crafting and building city improvements. <br><br>In the spirit of bigger is better, you can have up to 6 opponents (instead of 4), there are 12 spell circles consisting of &quot;effect circles&quot; - Destruction, biomancy, protection, augmentation, Summoning, Mentalism) and 6 &quot;elemental circles&quot; (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Life, Death) and you buy spell books or ranks in these 12 circles (you can even get Life and Death if you like unlike in MOM). <br><br>Most spells fall into 2 circles, so for example, a spell like Guardian wind that protects units from all mundane missiles is both a Protection as well as a Air spell at Level 4. So if you have either Protection 4, Air 4 or Protection 2 &amp; Air 2 and other combos you get access to that spell via research.<br><br>Spells are in 9 tiers instead of the more descriptive common, uncommon, rare, very rare.<br><br>The only area where PC is outdone in terms of choices is in the races you can control. In MOM you had 9 Arcana races (e.g High men, High elves, Halflings) and 5 Myrrans races (e.g dark elves, dwarves). In Planar conquest you get to pick only 8 races. But you do get the classic ones Human, Elves, dwarves, Orcs, insects etc and one unique undead type race.<br><br>Turn based tactical combat is pretty much MOM style, except with the mechanic of getting backstabbed if you move away from another unit, or if you cast a spell or fire a missle weapon when next to a enemy unit.<br><br>Another modern mechanic is attempts to counter city spam with soft limits.<br><br>Add D20 mechanics with Armour class, Savings throw to Fortitude \/ Reflex \/ Will Saving Throws which on paper sounds good and you have a modern remake of MOM. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Main weaknesses <\/div><br>Despite how much it plays like MOM, there are plenty of disappointed MOM fans who dislike this game. Why?<br><br>Firstly the UI is poor. I won't go into detail but you will be sending your units to the wrong locations all the time until you get used to it. Even after 50 hours of play it happens to me sometimes.<br><br>Poor UI also includes lack of notifications when needed (remember to check the logs each turn or miss out that expensive sword you were crafting was finished turns ago for example), unable to easily dismiss unit enchantments because you can't dismiss them from the unit screen and yet the global enchantment screen doesnt tell you which units are the unit enchantment tied to!<br><br>The game is also surprising bland due to lack of cut scenes (e.g when banishing a rival wizard, when a spell is researched or global spell is cast) . Cast a spell in overland or in tactical combat and you get boring effects if you are lucky, or in some cases nothing leaving you to wonder if the spell was cast.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Conclusion <\/div><br>Despite all these flaws, this MOM fan has been hooked by this game. <br><br>The current game I\u2019m playing is a 9 ranks Protection spell circle Sorcerer lord. I selected all 9 tiers for school of protection (there's also life school in game but protection works better) , got Protection mastery as well as Mentor (start with hero), enchanter (cast research enchantments city\/unit\/global -20\u2105), Warlord (units can reach 2 levels higher). I think I also got artificer (forge items -25%), alchemist (same as mom)<br>I added negative disciplines (retorts in mom speak) such as Ascetic (max 1k gold), butcher (1k population more killed after conquering city), Tyrant (10% more unrest) and Heretic (50% less power generation from Shrine etc).<br><br>The strategy is simple, crank out items for my starring hero, cast a ton of protection spells on it and go to town. Spells like Circle of Protection (+5 AC, +10 mundane resistance which blocks 10 points of mundane damage) makes my hero nearly immune to any damage by normal units whose weapons are not enhanced by elements or magic. Very powerful units that do a lot of mundane damage can still overload a mundane resist of 10 by doing more than 10 damage, but load up items that add to that and problem is solved.<br><br>I'm having a blast!<br><br>For people expecting modern innovative game mechanics should stay clear. Master of magic fans should try this. Particularly if on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29202571', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29202571' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29202571\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29202571' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29202571\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29202571', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29202571_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29202571_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29126247\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198069100726\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"108834998\">Sobriquet<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 34.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Planar Conquest for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was on a game forum recently and someone posted a game of MoM on dosbox...I grew up w it.

The Game consits of two parts, One is the over world in which you spend most of your time building up your cities and exploring the map. The second part is the turn based battles that happen when you interact with a map feature or when you battle another Mage\/Neutral City. The overall game is fun but there are alot of minor things that need perfecting. There is no indication of why the other mages have the opinion they have about you. The auto battle system will sometimes let your units die when facing enemies that you could easily beat with no death. Ranged units have ammo but their is no indication(that I saw) of how much ammo a troop starts with or has in battle. Starting up a game can be a bit confusing at first because of how their are mutiple realms but it defualts to one (I imagine that most players would like to play with all of them on) and the game has a certain amount of bugs but I didn't find any that ruined the game.<br><br>TL;DR Needs more polish but is playable and enjoyable\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27030714', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27030714' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short27030714\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27030714' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short27030714\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27030714', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27030714_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27030714_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26752549\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198285938596\/recommended\/449300\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"325672868\">agn<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat improvements over the game Worlds of Magic. Maps have improved (at least the ones I've seen) and the graphics are great. The only exception are the cities that look cartoonish! The spell bok appears to have been edited, which is a good idea. The starting setup cuts out the boredom of the first 50 turns. <br>The biggest problem is the &quot;select&quot; &quot;unselect&quot; and battle. The AI seems to fight against evey attempt to select and unselect armies. Really frustrating (a comment I hear on the YouTube gameplay videos). Battle is tedious, tedious, tedious. The autofight helps a great deal and has improved 100% over the Worlds of Magic game.<br>Finally, this game has Republican leanings - the constant attack by Neutrals - sometimes 9 attacks in a single move, seems overly aggressive. It also appears to cheat, and I don't like games that cheat. <br>And finally,  there seems to be issue of &quot;balance&quot;.  E.g. Titans roaming your world just as you get your infant warriors up and running! As well, how many times does a single city need to experience a catastrophe - every week?<br><br>Up till now, Master of Magic was the only game I played so I don't fully appreciate the &quot;culture or psychology&quot; of game design. For some this may be a great game. For me it is a good game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26752549', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26752549' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26752549\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26752549' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26752549\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26752549', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26752549_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26752549_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/449300\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 272 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30788377","23385740","23336478","23294416","23295229","23313603","24444721","23304512","24594238","23347128"]}
