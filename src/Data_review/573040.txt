As it may be understood from the title, this one is intended to be the first route - the route which belongs to the character Yuki Suzu - in the School of Talent setting. If this debut is to receive some recognition and positive feedback, developers already announced that they'll be making various other games, centering other characters in the story. So let's take a quick look to this one, shall we?<br><br>In this kinetic VN, we are to observe the result of Sakurai Kotaro's incredible luck, as he wins a lottery for his admission into Mikage Academy, an educational institution for young people with talents. Talents in this setting, are apparently various supernatural powers invoked in some people due to their powerful wish for a specific achievement in their childhood or early adolescence. At Mikage Academy, the Talented are to be trained properly, so one day they may use their talents to the benefit of the society. Earning his admittance by pure luck, Kotaro is the only talentless student that Mikage Academy has ever accepted. So, it should be challenge enough for him to earn a place and social acceptance in a school full of people with supernatural powers anyhow. Yet, this is not Kotaro's main problem. The night he gets accepted, Kotaro comes across a mysterious young girl who's been singing an enchantingly beautiful song: Yuki Suzu. Falling in love with the girl, Kotaro pursues her in hopes of learning more about her, and gradually winning her affection.<br><br>As I've stated before, this one is a kinetic visual novel, which means that there will be no choice actions. You'll be reading the storyline accompanied by various character CGs and some artwork until the end. Is this a good enough story to be witnessed? Well, if you do enjoy shoujo anime\/manga with sexual comedy remarks and dramatic revelations following a &quot;follow your heart&quot; theme, you are at the right place. The setting itself presents an adventurous enough atmosphere as it begins, but the main strength of the story centers around those elements. As you read, expect a smirk for the comedic parts and a smile for the dramatic parts.<br><br>Characters involving the story are mostly enjoyable stereotypes, and their interactions are not majorly creative. We have our eroticism obsessed generic pervert, our tsundere princess hidden behind an innocent facade, our tomboy girl with mediocre intelligence but golden heart, our wise yet mischievous mentor, and of course our decent guy protagonist, who is the most ordinary guy in the world with just good intentions. I'd say not to expect anything spectacular, but the setting and the character interactions are a good combination for your enjoyment. Enjoyed <i>Oh, My Goddess!<\/i> or <i>Fruits Basket<\/i>? Consider this one in a similar context. It is a comedy run until its very end, then it comes to present a tragic challenge and a heartwarming &quot;you are not alone&quot; closure. Neat alright!<br><br>Artwork is quite good and CGs are very much likable with various facial expressions. Yet, CGs do lack a variety for body language, presenting all characters mostly in the same physical stance, aside 1-2 exceptions. Soundtrack, on the other hand, is truly nice, with Yuki Suzu's trademark song, of course. The game is fully voice acted too. I must add that the sexualization and fan service within game was a tad bit more than what I'd like, but I do understand that some people would find it just right.<br><br>Go ahead and follow Kotaro's heart alongside him, and aid Suzu to make friends. It is a short yet beautiful story you may enjoy, if you do like the genre anyhow. The game presents an 8 hour or so storyline for you to go through, and Steam Cards were just added. I may advise to grab it on a sale though, since it doesn't present any active gaming.<br><br>Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/ladystoryteller#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >here<\/a> - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30342541', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30342541' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30342541\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30342541' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30342541\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30342541', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30342541_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30342541_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30399062\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">UN0W3N<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/games\/?tab=all\">2,693 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/\">229 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Basic Information<\/div><b>Title:<\/b>  School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE<br><b>Status:<\/b>  Released<br><b>Developer:<\/b>  MyDearest<br><b>Publisher:<\/b>  MyDearest<br><b>Genre:<\/b>  Visual Novel<br><b>Release Date:<\/b>  23rd of February, 2017<br><b>Type:<\/b>  Singleplayer <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">General Impression<\/div>Visual Novels on Steam or elsewhere, haven\u2019t been a genre that I may have attempted many times before. But that doesn\u2019t really disqualify my written opinion since it won\u2019t be just an educated guess either. By my estimation, I\u2019ve taken this story halfway through. My expectations weren\u2019t very high to begin with and yet I was still pleasantly surprised by the plotline itself. For a Steam debut, I\u2019m certain MyDearest have nothing to fear as far as public perception is concerned.<br><br>School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE\u2019s title is fairly self-explanatory. \u201cTalent\u201d is a substitute for magic but don\u2019t go thinking that we\u2019re dealing with a Japanese-style Hogwarts now. This particular School of Talent, known as the Mikage Academy, draws and trains the finest students from the entire country into the future\u2019s ruling elites. When our protagonist, Kotaro Sakurai (not the racing driver) is fortunate enough to receive a very rare scholarship there, a gentle balance of powers begins to shift erratically. As with any prestigious educational institution, there are factions that form a rift between the students themselves. The seemingly pure White Lilies and their doctrinary rivals, the underdogs never shy of speaking their minds, the Black Roses. I won\u2019t go too much into detail since I\u2019m not gonna spoil anything to you, but this tale of love and rivalry is more complex than it seems. I was expecting mostly clich\u00e9s and equally cheesy dialogue lines but the game\u2019s writing is top notch.<br><br>The game mechanics are standard fare for Visual Novels, but that is not an inherently bad thing. You can\u2019t fix what\u2019s not broken in the first place. As a result, School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE features the options of pausing or fast-forwarding the story, which unfolds through a numerous succession of slides, as I like to call them. Backgrounds, usually hand drawn in the same style as the characters, with slight animations that are always a nice touch and an obvious sign that you\u2019re not simply reading Manga on your PC monitor. What I would have enjoyed though, is the inclusion of dialogue branches. The option to alter the storyline in a meaningful way as you progress. It would have really given players both an increased sense of achievement and the option to replay the game at a future time and perhaps follow another path of direct interaction with the rich cast of characters.<br><br>As per Steam\u2019s own strict policy on nudity, the few slides which feature nude bodies, are treated in a tasteful manner, being more erotic and less revealing by nature. I am fully aware that adding full English voice acting, would have considerably driven the game\u2019s price up. I guess I will have to contend with the English subtitles (which were spotless in terms of grammar) until I shall learn Japanese. It does feel more authentic in its native tongue, given the locations and plot. You know best what you prefer. English dubs in anime and in visual novels aren\u2019t always hit-or-miss, but still represent a polarizing subject to some fans. I\u2019m perfectly fine with School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE\u2019s pricing and I can only hope the dev team might add Achievements along with the recently included Trading Cards. Whether you\u2019re a visual novel aficionado or someone who enjoys them sparingly, I firmly believe that no gamer should reject a genre, based on preconceptions. Try it out and if you like it, that\u2019s great. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s also fine and at least you tried and can now judge it in an informed manner.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Strong Points<\/div>+ Gripping story which resembles an emotional rollercoaster.<br>+ Pleasant graphics and appropriate soundtrack.<br>+ Decent length which justifies the price tag.<br>+ Steam Trading Cards (even if the Store Page isn\u2019t mentioning them).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Weak Points<\/div>- No English dubs.<br>- No Steam Achievements.<br><br><b>Rating 85\/100 <\/b><br> <br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/ImperialReviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Imperial Reviews<\/a> and <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Cubbes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Cubbes<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30399062', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30399062' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30399062\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30399062' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30399062\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30399062', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30399062_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30399062_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30378888\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pocahawtness\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10289296\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9dc5028a3c96430f4fa14ab6088edefb2420ba6e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9dc5028a3c96430f4fa14ab6088edefb2420ba6e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9dc5028a3c96430f4fa14ab6088edefb2420ba6e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pocahawtness\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10289296\">\uff62C\u2764A\uff63 Pocahawtness<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pocahawtness\/games\/?tab=all\">744 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pocahawtness\/recommended\/\">86 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pocahawtness\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA great slice of life \/ romance story that really is a surprisingly lengthy. Definitely for people who like a good long read! Excellent artwork and music. It's a great piece of software, that, sure, has a few wrinkles, but give how long it is, and how little it costs to buy, still translates in to a real bargain.  Oh, and it's written and presented in the first person so you get a real sense that you are the protagonist. The title, incidentally, School of Talents, refers to the fact that ( most of ) the students have special abilities, the concept of which I am sure you are well used to if, like me, you watch loads and loads of anime! Having said that, the story is not one that insists that the reader is a real fan of anime to appreciate. Some anime defintely needs the uninitiated to be lowered in gently (!!). So all in all if you like a good long read, with a great story, and love anime art style, then this is definitely a novel you will enjoy. And lets be honest, even if you don't, you haven't exactly spent a lot of money buying it, but you really have helped some talented people with their startup venture.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30378888', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30378888' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30378888\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30378888' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30378888\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30378888', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30378888_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30378888_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30590434\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MetalCapGoon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93456680\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26d3547f39dd2c0fc9618b51f8b0909b25cc0aae.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26d3547f39dd2c0fc9618b51f8b0909b25cc0aae.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26d3547f39dd2c0fc9618b51f8b0909b25cc0aae_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MetalCapGoon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93456680\">Yeet've<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MetalCapGoon\/games\/?tab=all\">222 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MetalCapGoon\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MetalCapGoon\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: Bought it for 1\/2 the price when it was still in Early Access<br><br>I'm not an avid visual novel reader but I felt like I had to leave a review for this since theres not that many. It is pretty short since it is only one route but for what you are paying for, its worth it. <br><br>Story is great but sometimes felt it got a little too predictable at times IMO.<br>The soundtrack and voice acting overall was great as well but noticed it had awkward transitions and would cut out unexpectedly in some scenes. The art was beautiful and showed character but I was dissappointed in the amount of blank black screens with text. The main voiced characters all had diverse traits and personalities and had chemistry in conversations but the named reoccuring characters that didn't have sprites or a voice just felt out of place and rushed. <br><br>MyDearest have proven themselves here in creating this hidden gem. They deserve more recognition for their talents as well as more supporters and fans. This VN is not perfect but its still pretty damn good. It does make me sad that it was so short though. I do wish it was longer. I hope that MyDearest will continue to create more visual novels and create more routes for this series.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30590434', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30590434' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30590434\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30590434' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30590434\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30590434', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30590434_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30590434_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30341784\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198142407852\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"182142124\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8a6ece861c9e28b2d9cf2758e24d6fed5569ddf.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8a6ece861c9e28b2d9cf2758e24d6fed5569ddf.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f8\/f8a6ece861c9e28b2d9cf2758e24d6fed5569ddf_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198142407852\/\" data-miniprofile=\"182142124\">Shu Omua<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198142407852\/games\/?tab=all\">29 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198142407852\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198142407852\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOkay so where do I even start?

However the good ones seem to get crushed under the deluge of cheap crap. <br><br>When I received an email asking me to check out this new one from MyDearest, learning it was only a few quid (\u00a35.99) and this was their first game, part of my soul died. However it\u2019s a VN, and I can\u2019t resist the urge even if I know it\u2019s gonna rip a bit of my heart out.<br><br>So colour me surprised when I found this one was actually a really solid VN, with only a bit of fanservice, mostly enjoyable characters, and a decent (if cliched) story. <br><br>If you want my TL:DR recommendation, if you\u2019re into VN\u2019s give this one a whirl!<br><br>I\u2019ve decided to split this review into two sections so I can address certain things. This first part will cover the game and MyDearest. Where as the second will cover Lapin Inc who did the localisation. But for now lets get started on the game.<br><br>Visual Novels live or die on two things, music and visuals. Given the games are generally static the music has to be top notch, in synch with the story, and not overpowering. Graphically the game has to look amazing. Everything from character art to back drops has to be perfect. If these aren\u2019t right it can kill the game, as people wont read a VN that looks ugly, or has annoying music. <br><br>Thankfully, School of Talent succeeds on this front, to a degree. The music for this game is gawd damn awesome, and if they don\u2019t release the music as a DLC OST I\u2019ll be greatly disappointed. Not to mention wondering if they\u2019re not interested in extra money!<br><br>Admittedly there\u2019s not a lot of songs in this game, but everytime one came up I would stop and just listen. They were so good they actually made me interested in listening to the whole thing, something I usually don\u2019t bother with.<br><br>The sound effects ranged from being great to meh, with most of them being in the good to great range, though there were a few that left me wondering why they choose such an odd sound, especially since it didn\u2019t fit in with setting and what the sound was supposed to sound like.<br><br>However on the whole this was a good mix and helped to drive the story along well. <br><br>Visually, the game looks awesome, can\u2019t and wont deny that. The characters are well drawn, looked amazing, and fit well with the personalities of the characters, bar one (who I\u2019ll talk about later on). Even the settings and back drops were pretty decent, and in truth the only complaint I had was lack of variety. As the game progressed you\u2019d be seeing more and more of the same backdrops, as well as even the same character art<br>I could forgive the back drops repeating, but for me the repeated character art was a big minus. Especially true since sometimes the character panel used didn\u2019t really fit with what was being said, it was a bit immersion breaking. That said though, it\u2019s hard to criticise it to much given the cost of the game. Character art isn\u2019t cheap to have done, and adding more variety there might have bumped the price to high.<br><br>The big question though is: How is the story?<br><br>Good question, and the answer (for me) is, it\u2019s an average story. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not as bad as a lot of the cheap VN's on steam these days. Sure it\u2019s cliched, but it\u2019s a VN, so you go in expecting cliches to be thick and heavy.<br><br>Sadly though, my complaint with the story is that it\u2019s to fast in the wrong places, and then tediously slow in the other wrong places. Lets take the start of the game for example, it starts off with a bit of nice pacing, setting the stage and introducing the theme of the story very well. It does such a good job of setting the stage and then it screeches to a jarring halt and jumps 1.5 years. This was a huge immersion breaker for me. Time jumps aren\u2019t an issue, and are a frequently used tool, but its how the jump is handled thats key. In this case the jump is done very badly.<br><br>Whats more the game established from the outset a big key point about the main character, which you expect to have something important in the story. But it\u2019s only ever used as a bat to condem the character. In fact there was no reason for the characters history, and even at the end of the game I was left wondering why it was made such a big thing over (so damn hard to write this without spoilers lol!!)<br><br>The story itself is decent, and was enjoyable to read through, no denying that! However, I found I really didn\u2019t like Suzu, I found her totally one dimensional for most of the story. While it\u2019s certainly true she\u2019s meant to have a bit of a personality issue, due to her childhood, I just felt what we were getting was flat and dull. By the time she\u2019d actually started to change and become interesting the story was over half way done, and she couldn\u2019t recover (in my mind). While she ends up with a good character personality, and actually did make me feel sympathy for her, she doesn\u2019t come close to other characters.<br><br>For me the best character in the game was Mayu, with her stalker\/masochist personality and the way she goes after the protagonist. I found her to be funny, and enjoyable, though her character art didn\u2019t really fit. Towards the end of the game its commented on how she\u2019s got big boobs, but throughout the game she\u2019s always portrayed as having, what I\u2019d call normal sized boobs for her size. It\u2019s a bit disjointed, and thinking back on some of the comments in the story it would have made sense for to have bigger boobs. That said, she\u2019s still by far the best character in the game!<br><br>Overall, I feel the story is decent, and enjoyable to read through. Especially with the supporting characters adding a lot of flavour to Suzu\u2019s initial bland start.<br><br>However, it is worth noting (if this is important to you) that the game has no story choices. In fact the single choice you get is a dream where you get to see nothing, and it has no effect on the story. Frankly it would have been better without it, but I understand the reason for it, but I personally wouldn\u2019t have it there. So yeah, this is essentially a pure novel, and while the game is called \u2018Suzu Route\u2019, there\u2019s no decisions to be made.<br><br>I\u2019m guessing they couldn't afford to do a full game where you got to decide which girl you wanted to go after, so have split it up into chapters with each girl getting their own short game. Hopefully when it\u2019s all done they can then merge them into a single big game where choices occur and matter.<br><br>Finally, lets talk game length, it\u2019s not long. For me I played through in around 80minutes. I\u2019ve seen some play throughs though as low as 50minutes.<br><br><br>Now, onto Lapin Inc. Lapin did the english localisation (and maybe the others?), and frankly these guys should be ashamed of themselves. According to the blurb for their company:<br><br>\tLocated in Tokyo, Lapin has been around for over 25 years, and until recently had focused \ton localization of English-language novels into Japanese. Now, we have begun applying \t\tour localization expertise to the video game industry, starting with love simulation games for \tiOS and Android.<br><br>So you\u2019d expect a company with 25 years experience to be pretty good at their job wouldn\u2019t you. Frankly they\u2019re garbage, when I was playing through initially I was wondering if MyDearest had done it themselves, which would account for some of the mistakes being made. <br><br>Learning it was done by an outside company I have to ask what the hell were these guys doing? The game is littered with untranslated sections, the odd word and lot more names. Then there\u2019s the puntuation and spelling mistakes that were so bad even I noticed them. For a company with supposedly 25 years in the industry this is abysmal. They need to work on a patch to fix these iss\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30497335', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30497335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30497335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30497335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30497335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30497335', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30497335_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30497335_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29634168\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105181351\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2765fa451efdb3519d77528ecc0b67c594329d10.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2765fa451efdb3519d77528ecc0b67c594329d10.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/27\/2765fa451efdb3519d77528ecc0b67c594329d10_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105181351\">feederguy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/games\/?tab=all\">1,670 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/feederguy\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's been delightful to witness so many visual novels being released on Steam over the past year. Some of them top-notch, some of them less so, and a couple of black sheep just dragging the reputation of the genre down.<br><br>Sifting through the many visual novels on Steam, School of Talent: SUZU Route was a title that initially slipped past my radar, probably because it was an Early Access title, and the first ever release of this tiny studio called MyDearest. I am extremely glad to have stumbled upon this unknown gem!<br><br>School of Talent: SUZU Route takes place in a prestigious school which only individuals with unique talents can enter (something like the academy in Danganronpa). There lie bitter rivalries amongst groups of students, in particular the Black Roses (where the male MC resides) and the White Lilies (of which Suzu, the female protagonist, heads). If you enjoyed Baka to Test or Assassination Classroom, you'll get a very similar vibes of the &quot;us versus them&quot; student mentality in this game.<br><br>Strengths:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The voice-acting is absolutely phenomenal. The lead girl Suzu is voiced by Rie Yamaguchi, who sang the <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yzKCrBGwc2Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka ED<\/a> (definitely worth a listen if you've never heard of her before). School of Talent features her singing voice as well! Right at the start of the game we are treated to her singing - it is the one of the greatest examples of mesmerising voice-acting I have experienced in a visual novel. As it turns out, singing is Suzu's talent, and we are spoiled with plenty more opportunities to enjoy her vocals.<br><\/li><li>The art is a joy to behold! This may just be personal opinion, but I feel that the illustrations are on par with anime studio quality.<\/li><\/ul>Downsides:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>There is only 1 route at the moment (As the title suggests, that of Suzu). The story does feature other girls, and hints at  romances with them which sadly will never reach fruition. Such a tease!<\/li><\/ul>Definitely, given the price of the game and its quality, I'm really not entitled to complain about this downside. Still, I would prefer paying more to buy a full game, compared to the possibility of individual routes as future DLC? As someone who dislikes the trend of DLC releases, I would hate to see such a feature forced onto the realm of visual novels.<br><br>Although the game is rather short at the moment, at its current price point I don't think there are any better visual novels out there on Steam. Especially not for a fully voice-acted title. I'd thoroughly recommend this title to any fans of visual novels, especially those looking to support budding developers of talent!<br><br>I look forward to MyDearest's foray out of Early Access, and hopefully further game releases in the future!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29634168', 'summary' );

Therefor for this first time I'll try to focus more on the character, settings, art quality, and story without spoiling anything away.<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td>Sypnosis<\/td>\t<td>This visual novel is about the story of a student named Kotaru who is hopelessly in love with a girl from a school full of people who have super powers. In this case said powers are called 'TALENTS' [Hence school of talents, geddit?] And thus his many adventures and misadventure to get the girl to notice him.<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td>Art, Text and, Voices, and Option [And music.]<\/td>\t<td><b>Art<\/b><br>\nThe art is excellent, every character sprite looks well done as you can probably see from the steam screenshots themselves. The scenery are rather generic looking classroom, hallways, and other location but the good thing is that they are still drawn images and not real life images that had a blur filter applied to them. The few CG that are in this visual novel are also quite good. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Text<\/b><br>\nThe translation of the game is excellent in most of the part. Characteristic of each of the cast was very well presented through their respective dialogue. Some parts of it do feel kind of awkward especially when the main character starts monologuing on about how he likes the main girl so much. The strength of the writing I say comes from the interaction of the whole diverse cast itself rather than the main character himself.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Voices<\/b><br>\nGood,like real good. I was under the impression they used actual native japanese to speak the dialogue and it shows on how good they speak it. No complains in here and the main character is unvoiced.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Options<\/b><br>\nStandard VN fare, change language, skip option, sound option and so on. Nothing outstanding. <span class=\"bb_strike\">Be aware if you want the game to work properly to disable Japanese region when starting because it behaves weirdly with it on for all you people who read JP vn.<\/span><br>\nUpdate: The latest update to the game fixed the issue.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Music<\/b><br>\nForgettable, in a good way. It enhances the mood rather than being grating which is a big nono. Apparently some stock sound effect were used but they weren't so obvious. After all good music tend to disappear in the background, bad one bugs you for days.<\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td><b>Review<\/b><\/td>\t<td>Ok so this VN is essentially a kinetic visual novel love story which does not feature much if any choices at all [I argue for this story it enhances it], in an attempt to not spoil much I'll try to talk about this story a little bit so bear with me.<br>\n<br>\nEssentially a love story, the story is pretty good. I enjoyed the way the characters when they do appear on screen interact with one another. Several of the characters when they do appear tend to take the spotlight off the main story when appear but this isn't really a bad thing. As I mentioned this is a typical love story in a school but people have superpowers.<br>\n<br>\nThe main love story between guy and girl can slowly get boring over the course of the story. In my opinion [REMEMBER, OPINION. IT COULD BE TERRIBLE.] they simply had too much time on screen when dealing with their [love] thingy. The rest of the story features multiple incident and a grand overarching theme that ends very nicely especially since they develope over the course of the story instead of just remaining static.<br>\n<br>\nOh that's what I like about them. They evolve. Not static papier mache sprite giving exposition throughout the stories but evolving slowly from those multiple incident. Sure the main guy and girl suffer from uncurable angst but they got a bunch of others to back em up. Kinda like a sweet romeo and juliet story. I never read romeo and juliet. <br>\n<br>\nThey also got plenty of scenery to back that up, no they don't just get stuck in school and some clearing but they alternate between a small bunch of place. Limited but not bad. Also things always seem to happen leaving the lull between love monologue kinda manageable. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the ending? I say it wraps up the story nicely. No loose end, all things tied up in a package. <\/td><\/tr><tr>\t<td><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/td>\t<td>Not a bad indie VN at all, good production value, excellent voice cast, a good story featuring a diverse array of characters each with their own personality. Sure the angst in the story with the main character who uses a few cliche gets in the way from time to time but its nothing tooo bad. Also it kept the obligatory scenes [You know what I mean] to a minimum which is nice. My playtime may say 12 hours but its closer to an 8 I say. Not bad at all. <br>\n<br>\nDiscloser: Yes I got this for free from the dev for review purposes so there's your disclosure, this did not affect my review at all except from getting a new best girl to add to my visual novel waifus.<br>\n<br>\nScoring Methology:<br>\n-\tS-Rank: excellent<br>\n-\tA-Rank: very good<br>\n-\tB-Rank: solid<br>\n-\tC-Rank: satisfactory<br>\n-\tD-Rank: inferior<br>\n<br>\nResults: A-Rank [Good story, good cast, some angst, a few bugs but overall good.] <br>\n<br>\nP\/S: <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Here's hoping to see a route based on actual best girl Azami.<\/span><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30141004', 'summary' );

There, he becomes the outlier, the only person without a single special power. This slice of life, mostly-voiced kinetic VN allows you watch Kotaro's relationship with his friends and love interest develop. Note that there is only one route\/romance option - Suzu.<br><br>Be warned that there are tons of super clich\u00e9d and cringy situations here without imaginative dialogue or narration to cover them up. Kotaro, the weak nobody, has a major crush on the most powerful girl in school, the head of the White Lilies dorm. In a sequence of eye-rolling events every otaku will see a mile away, there will be <i>some<\/i> surprises that'll at least bring a laugh or two. Naturally, there will be a locker room scene, a bathing scene, and a summer festival, but this has become a welcomed norm in school VNs\/anime for a very long time so I can't imagine anyone not expecting that. One surprise in this novel, an underutilized fan favorite in my opinion, is the crowd-pleasing body swap chapter. <br><br>The gameplay can be a bit rough at times with random untranslated lines and menu-language issues, but nothing was jarring enough to become critical, just a bit immersion breaking. The music and sound effects are relatively generic, and the artwork is more down-to-earth so to speak, with very simplistic backgrounds in most cases (CGs do look good though). Furthermore, there aren't that many CGs\/camera pans with <b>overt<\/b> pandering to fanservice, maybe only a few - take that how you will. Instead you will mostly find fanservice in the very suggestive dialogue and people's reactions, but I find that much more enjoyable than generic hyper boob VNs. Everyone has their own tastes so I'm not going to judge, just inform.<br><br>It did seem unfortunate that although the setting is in an elite school of &quot;special powers&quot; (magic), everything is too ordinary and mundane. There's nothing technologically advanced, occult-like, or magical in sight. Even though there are magical duels, there are no graphics, animations or even CGs of the magic itself. Just a lightbulb flash here or there with a couple sound effects, making me feel like the game is shying away from the visual aspect of being a visual novel.<br><br>What further shines a light on this problem is that the writing is fairly weak during the duels, devoid of artistic imagery or smooth transitions. When you couple that with absentee magic illustrations\/animations, we end up with drab special talent duels. Fortunately, the school life aspect of the game (which comprises the bulk of SoT) is much more interesting and prevalent than the magical duels aspect.<br><br>What really made the game stand out was the voice acting, hands down. The VO added lively personality traits that the script could not and solely carried my engagement and attachment to the cast. In the beginning of the game, we secretly catch Suzu singing and it was really jaw dropping. It made a really strong impression which carried itself throughout the game. Wait until you can hear the entire song with accompaniment - its ASMR levels of amazing. Afterwards we meet Otake, a perverted dorm mate who\u2019s Talent is Eroticidence, and Mayu, a masochistic stalker that can turn invisible. Although these descriptions make them seem very amusing to watch, it's their voice acting that really sells the part. SoT has some colorful characters, and even though there were many common tropes and rushed situational developments, I somewhat miss the goofballs now that everything is over.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Complete [Early Access] Walkthrough Playlist<\/div><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cm7OvVsx94w&amp;list=PLeavCsRFiP55vWFNNhua1_0nn0dngvp7F&amp;index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cm7OvVsx94w&amp;list=PLeavCsRFiP55vWFNNhua1_0nn0dngvp7F&amp;index=1<\/a><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div><br>With a little more love, polish, and some script re-writing, School of Talent can be a really amazing VN for its price. The voice acting and character traits are just that good. Even in its current state, SoT is still a worthwhile adventure. I've played some very aggressively average VNs on steam, many costing more than this game, but I haven't run into any with voice acting (especially ones that are this well done) at a similar price point. This makes it easy for me to recommend School of Talent to any VN fan looking for a casual, albeit rough, kinetic novel. <br><br>Note: the devs are open to a possibility of releasing other routes as separate games. I really hope they do, as long as they can maintain the great voice acting.<br><br><table class=\"bb_table\"><tr><td>Press copy provided by MyDearest<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br><table class=\"bb_table\"><tr><td><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/BeforeYouBuy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Before You Buy<\/a> \u2013 analyses of newly released indie games<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30025603', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30025603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30025603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30025603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30025603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30025603', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30025603_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30025603_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29599267\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ffleader1\/recommended\/573040\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"176665220\">ffleader1<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while School of Talent: SUZU-ROUTE was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough this game is currently in EA with a few problem here and there, I still strongly recommend this game.<br>Pros:<br>+ Interesting Story.
