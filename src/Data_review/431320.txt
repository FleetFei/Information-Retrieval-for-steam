Recourse is a quite heavy game, even though I could run this on a laptop with a dual-core processor although cooling issues (or that I suspect) kept me from progressing; I've thought of testing if I could find a certain bottleneck like, I dunno, RAM or the integrated GPU or something else, something tangible that I could see and identify as a possible cause for the problem, but since I don't use the old craptop anymore, I haven't had the exact chance for that.<br><br>Disclaimer: I'm writing this review partly with the full version in mind, so my experiences with it influence this review, e.g. when I compare the demo and the full game.<br><br>Anyways, Recourse as a game is very great; it's one of my favourites so far. For the keyboard + mouse configuration, controls are smooth and working. I also like that players are able to switch between 1st person and 3rd person views as they like, so those who prefer either can choose and not be bound to whatever the developers have chosen.<br><br>When it comes to the story, it's mostly covered by the conversations between Sleet, who's your player character, and Floe as you progress through levels, but it works since it not only gives you information on what has happened, but also builds up what kind of characters Sleet and Floe are. The demo's story starts rather differently from that of full version's but the setting is same: you find yourself from an unknown place and proceed to find out where you are and why. Like it's said in the description, this demo is a standalone game, and in my experience it's the perfect way to see how well Recourse runs on your machine and at which settings; there is a fair amount graphic settings to adjust. The demo also lets you get inside what kind of a game Recourse is, allowing the player to see if they like it, so I recommend anyone who's interested in the game to try it out. It's free, after all, and also small in size so it won't take up that much space. The developer's Youtube channel also has videos on Recourse, I recommend to check them out too.<br><br>In the gameplay, there are three different kinds of stages: Puzzle stages, Wave Rush stages and Payload stages. Puzzle stages, as can be suspected from the name, are progressed by solving puzzles with a variety of mechanics, and I have enjoyed them; they are not too difficult to repel beginners, I never found them too easy to bore me, especially since certain opened doors etc. remain open after finishing the stage and thus don't force the player to redo them when returning to the stage later. Later on in the game and especially when looking for question marks and achievements such as easter eggs they do challenge as the player learns to use what they have.<br><br>Wave Rush levels are about fighting enemies known as failbots and gather failbot drives to open up doors in the stage and exchange for waves that can be used for upgrades for Floe. Just like Puzzle levels and Payload levels, these levels also have question marks to be found to use for upgrades.<br><br>In Payload levels, you escort a wagon through its route while erasing obstacles from its way and beating failbots, thus earning failbot chips that need to be deposited into the wagon before the time runs out and the wagon closes up for the rest of the stage - more time can be acquired on the stage, so there is space for exploring the stage to find question marks and exploring. Any chips deposited into the wagon are carried out of the level to be used for upgrades.<br><br>TL;DR: I haven't tried out co-op nor controllers, so those are for other players to tell. However, for what I've experienced, I have nothing to complain about the except that it requires quite a quite powerful computer to play it with a decent FPS on high settings. The story is interesting and well executed, gameplay is smooth and movement free, and the game looks great and pleasant, plus the colors are colorblind-friendly. In addition to that all, the game doesn't take much space and is thus fast to download. The demo is perfect for testing the game before choosing to buy it. :)<br><br>Pros:<br>-Nice idea<br>-Works well<br>-The colors are pleasant and nothing hurts my eyes + colorblind-friendliness<br>-Nice puzzles that make the player use their brains<br>-Intriguing story that is executed well via the conversations<br>-The main characters are very good<br>-Smooth controls<br>-Small file size<br>-A lot to see and find<br>-In my own experience the developers have been active and helpful on Steam's discussions on Recourse<br>-The possibility to switch between 1st person and 3rd person views<br><br>Cons:<br>-It's a heavy game for the hardware<br><br>Old text: &quot;I haven't played this much, not even to the end of the first level, because my laptop's cooling sucks and can't handle this for even 10 minutes without the whole laptop heating up so badly that it starts to lag at 3 to 5 FPS. Seriously, I'm perfectly fine with 10 to 18 FPS I usually have with medium settings (I could get it to something like 20 FPS when I lowered the resolution), but when the voice starts lagging too, it's the end of playing, no can do. Just as the requirement of Quad-Core processor may suggest, this is a very heavy game (but I can easily run this on my dual-core processor *lol* the only problem is the crappy cooling and it's troubling everywhere). Anyhow, I do like this a lot, this is a great game.&quot;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23382337', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23382337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23382337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23382337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23382337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23382337', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23382337_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23382337_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28285351\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Trucidar\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"88757683\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e68039f185a91714ad49235443a884d9ddf7e3a6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e68039f185a91714ad49235443a884d9ddf7e3a6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e6\/e68039f185a91714ad49235443a884d9ddf7e3a6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Trucidar\/\" data-miniprofile=\"88757683\">Trucidar<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Trucidar\/games\/?tab=all\">2,219 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Trucidar\/recommended\/\">153 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Trucidar\/recommended\/431320\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Recourse Demo for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExtremely fun puzzle game with an insane amount of potential.
