This game is all three of those rolled up into a fat burrito.<br>The problem with this delicous and savory burrito, however, is that every once in a while you will bite into a squirmy little bug. Some of these bugs don't taste that bad, and the burrito is tasty, so you hammer down and continue eating. Untill you find a ugly nasty bug that makes your drop your burrito (straight to your desktop (wink)).  But &quot;darn it&quot;, you will say, &quot;this burrito has so much potential for fun! I'll presevere through these bugs. Heck, I think I'll share it with a friend!&quot;<br><br>And you do, you share it with your friend. The burrito tastes even better with a friend (or even multiple friends). Everyone will have fun and enjoy it, but eventually, you may bite into a bug so gross, that it will make you forget where you were eating the burrito so you'll have to start over from the beginning... which, after eating that burrito for a while, doesn't sound as appetizing. <br><br>Ultimately, this burrito is a wonderful burrito, with much thought and care put into. The burrito allows for you to eat it in whatever way you see fit.  You can find yourself eating this burrito for hours, trying to find the best way to consume the delicous ingrediants. The bugs, and perhaps some uncooked peices of chicken (trade routes), can make it a little harder to swallow.<br><br>If this burrito is on sale and you are interested, purchase it and eat it. <br><br>If not, maybe save your money for Burrito 3 (due in 2017).<br><br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30417004', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30417004' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30417004\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30417004' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30417004\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30417004', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30417004_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30417004_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30494210\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198323444732\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"363179004\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198323444732\/\" data-miniprofile=\"363179004\">clayman364<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198323444732\/games\/?tab=all\">9 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198323444732\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198323444732\/recommended\/39680\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">41.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI love this game.

Its not everyone's cup of tea.  And on top of that, its severely buggy and largely unpolished.  But if you look past all that roughness, there is a true gem in here.  Not many games deliver so well on so much.  It may be one of the best PC games I've ever played.  Consider the following story as a testament to what kind of game this is:<br><br>I started out an innkeeper in a large city in a large region.  I was doing okay.  I kept selling cheap food and drink in order to open a bakery nearby.  The bakery was also not much, mostly baking rolls for the masses.  But in time I was doing well financially and took some time off to pursue a love interest.<br><br>The same year she was pregnant and gave birth to my first born son.  I was busy working and she spent less time at the bakery.  Soon all her time was spent between the house and the church.  Neither of us minded though.  My son was of school age and we couldn't afford much.  So we sent him to a guild school to study to join the family business.  The same year, my wife was pregnant again, but this time with a little girl.<br><br>During this time I was able to afford to be a citizen and was granted the ability to expand my business.  I quickly set up an orchard and a farm outside the gates.  It was hopeful, as the supplies for both the Inn and Bakery were now completely controlled by me.<br><br>By the time my daughter was of school age, we had the assets to send her to the best school possible.  My first born son, was not the most amitious child and my first born daughter had a brighter future due to our new financial situation.<br><br>I had another daughter, and another son.  More of the same, I suppose, as I was too busy working at the largely successful Inn and expanding my business to fisheries and livestock.<br><br>My first born son was a disappointment.  He was born when we were poor and didn't amount to much.  He mostly went to church with his mother and didn't have the skills to follow in the family business.  My first born daughter on the other hand, had the right schooling and was perfectly set up to join the family business.  My second daughter, while successful on her own terms, didn't match the success of the first daughter.  And lastly, my last born child, a boy, was quiet and simply enjoyed school.<br><br>When my first born daughter came of age to help out, she did with much ambition.  While I worked the Inn, she helped with apple picking and livestock.  She was maybe a bit too ambitious as she managed the workers with the attitude of a tyrant.  But I was happy with the success of my business and I was running out of room to expand, so I turned to politics.<br><br>I managed to win a low level office for a very short time before getting replaced by a man who had leprosy.  However, my daughter almost entirely transitioned my business empire away from me and was doing quite well.  So I kept at it.  I had money to spend, so I intended to use it.  I began bribing people for votes, and I managed to bribe the king himself.  But, I lost again.<br><br>While my daughter ran my business, and I was unsuccessful at politics, I had little to do.  So for the most part, I rekindled my relationship with my aging wife.  Also, my character strangely had alcohol in his inventory often, and was no stranger to drinking it on the spot or offering it to others.  On a strange night, I also tried sabotaging a rival bakery by tossing an explosive in the front door.  It was a mistake and didn't do much.<br><br>While I declined from power and my daughter took over, I failed to notice my last born son.  He graduated from university with a doctorate.  He was a scholar and was a full grown man ready to open his own line of business.  Upon his graduation, he quickly started a bank and hospital in town.  He worked hard, but being the business man in the family, I saw issues.  Two doors down from his bank was a rival bank.  Around the corner from his hospital, was a rival hospital.  <br><br>He was happy working and keeping to himself, so I took it upon myself.  We bombed them and ran.  I went home to my wife and all was fine.  Except, it wasn't.<br><br>While I was at home with my wife, my son was working late at the hospital, and my daughter was working late night at the Inn, my daughter, unfortunately lead by her father's poor example, carried out a constant barrage of attacks across the entire city for hours.  Many people died, including many of my loyal bodyguards, and several buildings were so heavily damaged they couldn't be entered for fear of collapse.<br><br>The tooltip read for me - Corrupt.  My entire life I was a righteous man and in a single day I ruined a lifetime of good.  My daughter however, was labeled a walking nightmare.  A title she wore proudly as she was a violent and cruel woman.<br><br>A day later I was summoned to trial for my crimes.  And shortly after, so was my daughter.  Fortunately for me, the persecuter was bad at her job and couldn't articulate my crimes well enough.  With experience, I was able to convince the judges that I was not guilty.  My daughter - the judge didn't even show and she walked free.<br><br>I was done, however.  And now my entire business was in the hand's of my daughter and son.<br><br>A few short years later my daughter married and had a series of daughters.  My son married and had sons.  She spent most of her time in the Inn, acting as an innocent server as she masterminded violence.  Her first born daughter stayed at home with her father, picking up the skills for crafting.<br><br>My son on the other hand built up impressive charismatic skills and began spending most of his time preaching.  He opened his own Catholic church and was busy speaking to the masses.  He wasn't as interested in the hospital anymore due to issues obtaining supplies needed for medicine.  That was, however, one of the catalysts for what happened next.<br><br>Illness spread across the city.  It struck the elderly for the most part.  And the political stage was swept clean.<br><br>My son saw this as an opportunity to win an easy election and do some good for the city.  So he applied for a entry level political office.<br><br>My first born daughter's daughter was also of age and opened up a tailoring shop.  She worked in it night and day and was militant, like her evil mother.  However, she just enjoyed working hard.  She committed no crimes and often gave bonuses to her employees to reward them for putting up with her management style.<br><br>My son had only one opponent to beat for political office.  But to help seal the deal, his sister showed up and gave some bribe money to the king.  He won the vote and was now holding political office.  First it was the Leasing Officer.  Then it was the Guild Master.  Then Bishop.  Then he used his political power to help his sister and neice also win politcal offices.<br><br>He had charisma and the power of the people behind him.  His sister was a brute with deep pockets.  She kept helping him win and in return, he would give her his vote when she applied.  Together, they made it to the top - Cardinal, Soverign, and my grandaughter was Consul.  Together, they took down bandits, banished rivals, carried out crime and government authority hand in hand.  All while I watched from my estate.  My children took over the city both economically and politcally.  All while in my lifetime.

Having said that, it is still a big improvement over the last vanilla version, and I can also recommend either Fajeth or McCoy's mods to make the game even more playable.  Both do different things, but both are fantastic.  It is my recommendation that you try both (separately - mods generally can't work together in TG2) and definitely use one of them, especially once you've played vanilla for 50 hours or so to get a grasp for the basics of the game.<br><br>Onto the review: I will not belabor the point: The Guild is my favorite game.  In this review I\u2019ll try to explain why this is, and where I\u2019m coming from in terms of my interest in the game, and probably games generally speaking.  Hopefully this will help introduce like-minded gamers to The Guild and perhaps also steer some people, if they have different tastes, from the game.<br><br>I have always enjoyed simulation games, particularly economic and life sims.  I grew up playing what now seem like fairly simplistic sims (e.g., Theme Park, The Settlers, and The Sims) and was fascinated by the seemingly living world of the AI inhabitants in these games.  As I began to enjoy role playing games more, and in particularly Ultima Online, I longed for a simulation game in which I wasn\u2019t in complete control, but instead could actually be one of those small inhabitants in the simulated world.  Nothing like this existed until I played the first Guild game (Europa 1400) and I was immediately won over, realizing that it was as close to a perfect game as I would ever find, short of developing one myself.<br><br>The Guild is indeed a simulated world.  It doesn\u2019t attempt to be huge like Skyrim.  You are controlling a small family in a single town or on some maps a single town out of up to four.  There are up to eleven other \u201cdynasties\u201d (i.e. families) living in these towns, and they all go about their business without your intervention.  You are not god in this game \u2013 you are just a family existing and striving in the middle ages, and it is amazing fun.  It seems there is not one area that The Guild has left out of its gameplay.  You can get involved in politics, your character has a religiosity meter, favor (or disfavor) with every single sim in the game, a disposition based on their criminality or lack thereof, skills, perks (think fallout), marriage, children, trials, duals, and the list goes on.<br><br>The world in The Guild feels more alive than any game I have played.  NPCs go about their business with a real purpose, and it is all simulated.  They will do everything from sit around town and chat, go to the pub, hire a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, to run for office and command the city guard (who, by the way, are also governed by some degree of AI logic).  In short, the game feels a lot like living in a real, functioning medieval town.<br><br>In summary, if you\u2019ve always enjoyed god games, economic sims, and life sims, but wanted to be part of the world rather than the controller of the world \u2013 wanted to have to work within the confines of human ability to influence the world (e.g., become mayor and change the law instead of using a hand in the sky to smite someone) then this is the game for you.  If you want complete control over the world and all of its inhabitants then you might not enjoy this as much, but I still say it\u2019s worth a try.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8176438', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8176438' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8176438\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8176438' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8176438\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8176438', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8176438_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8176438_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t147 of 156 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12545392\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiNxR8\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"180109898\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/5205d76eb9d0fdee7162c83844074003b2d2ff5b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/5205d76eb9d0fdee7162c83844074003b2d2ff5b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/5205d76eb9d0fdee7162c83844074003b2d2ff5b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiNxR8\/\" data-miniprofile=\"180109898\">[63e] JiNxR8<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiNxR8\/games\/?tab=all\">47 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiNxR8\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JiNxR8\/recommended\/39680\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 18, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBrilliant that Nordic Games have started patching this games wound!

Whomever these guys are that bought this license are serious about cleaning it up, but the thing is it was already a great title to begin with. Yeah there were some translation problems, and ai issues, and general problems like that, but it wasn't terrible.<br><br>Anyways, this game is just great. You play some male or female person set in old timey overseas land (you get to choose the map to play on), and try to stary a dynasty. You find a spouse, make some kids, and play through the generations. Jobs include stuff from politics, farming, to robbing people. You can make buildings like inns, pubs, churches, and so on or eleminate competing dynasties and take over their buildings through violence or cash. You can select your own stats on the dude or chick you're creating and level up skills through actions, so some rpg elements exist. <br><br>You got some trading elements in here as well. Own a mine? Send a caravan of ore to the neighboring village to sell, or import the stuff to make your own jewelry factory. Or make armor and weapons and attack villagers with your bandits. You got a lot of options here on what to do as far as playstyle is concerned. It's a sandbox, but you can't just plop buildings down everywhere. Still there's a lot of options to be found and fun to be had by picking this up and giving it a shot. It can be a little daunting to get into, but I ended up having a lot of fun with this and The Guild II.

Steep Learning curve. Old Graphics. Buggy Mess. One of my favorite games. <br><br>So I want to start off by saying if you're interested buy this version of the game and only this game. This is a stand alone game, and it is the most up to date - bug-free version. Also, getting the MegaMod pack doesn't hurt either, adds a lot to the game and fixes a bunch of bugs. <br><br>It took me 4-5 times on separate occassions to get into this game. Until I finally found my stride and went deep in, and man I feel like I was missing out. If you've ever played Civilization games you know the term 'one more turn' - well this game gives you exactly that same feeling. <br><br>Top Pros: <br><b>VERY economy based<\/b> - Ever played Runescape or Eve Online? If you ever enjoyed how authentic the economy was then you should have an appreciation for this game. The economy is authentic by AI &amp; you, there is real supply and demand, and the AI naturally imports and exports from city to city. Your business decisions will depend on local supply &amp; competition. <br><b>Family based<\/b> - Much like CK this is a family dynasty game - not a city or statist game. You will find your wife\/husband, live and die, then subsequently control your family as you desire (up to 3 can actively be controlled) <br><b>Politics<\/b> - Politics are hard to get into and can be a bit too shallow in places but deep in others. You can try to gain favor of your fellow towns people, and get high enough social stats and take public offices - and then use your public office to not only make more income but to destroy your competition. Trying to get my dynasty to control the city has been a blast. <br><b>Court System<\/b> - You can bring other people up to charges on various crimes, or be brought to court by others (very common place if you play a rogue. The dialogue is pretty lackluster, but it gives a good incentive to play politician so that you have a naturally high favor of the courts - else you'll suffer the fat of my first rogue and go to jail for 5 years. <br><b>Spy System<\/b> - You can hire thugs to spy on your competition for evidence of your competitors then use that evidence to black mail them or bring them to trial. You can also have them firebomb their buildings, although if they catch you - you can suffer through the courts. Very fun system. <br><b>Family Class<\/b> - When you start you pick one of 4 classes. Patron (food &amp; inns), Crafting (mining &amp; crafting various equipment and jewlry), Scholar (Churches, Hospitals &amp; crazy magical artifact making), or Rogue (Theving, Whoring, Pirating, &amp; Plundering). For your first time I'd say Patron or Crafting is best.<br><b>Multiplayer<\/b> - I haven't played it but I feel like I need to mention the fact that this game does have multiplayer similar to the single player. This setup seems to be MADE for drinking games with the buddies.<br><br><br>Top Cons: <br><b>Long Tutorial, and still not enough<\/b>  - Watch some vids online as well if you have the time. I liked this guy: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R9Gl-_32mho\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R9Gl-_32mho<\/a><br><b>Social aspect is very shallow<\/b> - If you optomize it correctly it takes about a day to court to marry someone. The depth really goes as far as telling the person to follow you and every couple of hours clicking on a random social interaction as cool downs go. The social aspect of other villagers are also similarly shallow, though you get a few more options through politics &amp; items.<br><b>Badly Optimized<\/b> - Likely due to the fact that you're running a similation of hundreds of people, businesses &amp; local economies, the game can run pretty badly. Luckily Guild 3 seems to be fixing that issue, Guild 2 wont run well. <br><b>Bugs<\/b> - So many bugs in this game, though a whole lot has been fixed with a recent patch (update to latest game) and mods. Be aware you'll have a lot of non-game breaking bugs and a few game breaking ones here and there. <br><b>Depth<\/b> - Mentioned in the pros section, there is a lot of sections that are so shallow in certain aspects. Social, politics, &amp; court has such potential. <br><b>Bad UI<\/b> - Hard to explain but there are certain quirks to the UI that are difficult to work around. When you're running dozens of businesses there is no real way to manage the trade routes without memorizing them or following them. The business management on the right can't be customized or rearranged - very inconvenient when you have to scroll up several businesses in order to just send a cart to the market. This may be my biggest personal Con. <br><b>Family Management<\/b> - Having to due with the Bad UI, the family management system is pretty bad. You can only control 3 people at once but if you don't control people they don't live their own lives to my knowledge.. So you have to switch them out if you remotely care about your virtual children.. <br><br>Simply put - this game is for people who are looking for a game that scratches a certain itch. For me it I've been looking for a solid realistic business game, for others it may be a local political simulator, for others it may be a dynasty game. If you think this game will scratch it and you have a solid day to dedicate to learning a new game. Give this a buy.

The only downside, and reason why this game isn't that well known anymore and receiving mixed reviews as of late is the number of bugs. There are however a number of third-party mods that purport to fix some or most of them. That said, it's the only game I've seen that comes close to delivering the four topics I mentioned above in a real-time medieval setting. Definitely looking forward to the Guild III. <br><br>I've started as a craftsperson, forging weapons and tools; a thief picking people's pockets in town; a highway man; a cleric; a doctor; bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh . . . . you get the idea.

You're to have a dynesty of your own that can survive centuries starting in the 1400s and you can start from the available classes and who knows what class your family will reach off into. The posibilities seem endless truly and I love the pace I have set for myself where I have every round last only a year (too slow? you can turn it up to 4 years that pass between each round I believe). Truly The Guild 2: Renaissance is a gem in the corner of Steam. It's a timeless game in my opinion that has humerous moments, moments where you get rather frustrated, and moments where you just enjoy watching your workers horde materials they collect for their designated building. The sass, frustration, and mystery is what has me addicted right now honestly and is in a way what I wished The Sims 3: Medieval would have been. Honestly. <br><br>I think once you manage to set your graphics to your liking and see what works best for you, you'll have a smooth ride through for a gaming session that could last hours. <br><br>9.5\/10 game for me.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30760933', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30760933' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30760933\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30760933' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30760933\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30760933', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30760933_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30760933_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30758175\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MuddyX\/recommended\/39680\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"97377019\">Dickolas the Clitoris<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 52.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is by far the most underrated game I own on Steam. I can't help but praise it, it's a great game. You play as a character who's goal is to eliminate all other dynasties on the map by running businesses, running for office, commiting murder, etc. You get married, have children and expand your monopoly as much as possible. The game has 4 classes: Patron, Craftsman, Scholar and Rogue or as I call them: Farmer, Money Machine, Priest and Serial Killer. You can end up having one of each by marrying someone with that profession or by sending your children to school.<br><br>My favorite thing to do in this game is to start my own unofficial city. You save up enough money, build a home in empty land on a road between two cities and spam bombard towers. Meanwhile, your competitors will try to trade between cities only to have them raided every time. They will eventually take matters into their own hands and march over to your &quot;city&quot;. That's when you murder them in cold blood and become an outlaw for the rest of the game. It's your way or the highway and you own the highway now too. Want to try this? Start as rogue and take over a mine as fast as you can. Selling gems will make you rich and you can start building. Try and take over most or all the mines after that if you can.<br><br>It's difficult to learn how to manage businesses at first since you need to supply them, sell products to the right market and upgrade them. You can set your business to automatic but I always preferred manual until I have too many to manage. It gets fairly stressful but that all goes away once you snowball your profits enough. You end up having too much money to know what to do with if you play it right. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy and roleplaying games. You get a lot of freedom in the way you work towards your goal and it gets better if you have friends to play it with.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30758175', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30758175' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30758175\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30758175' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30758175\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30758175', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30758175_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30758175_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30726410\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198027389893\/recommended\/39680\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"67124165\">Squanchy<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 71.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat game, sure its difficult to understand it at the beginning and if you don't know what you are doing you will constantly lose money. But once you understand the concept and the basics there are so many ways you can play this game, you wanna play honourfull and get money with doing honest work or do you wanna be a rouge and steal things other dynasties produced (just for you :D ) or do you just keep the competition busy with constantly sabotaging their production while you thrive. You can go into politics, get new rights and ways to \u2665\u2665\u2665 someone else up or you can make charges on someone that constantly steals from you and hopefully sent him to prision or even get his head chopped of.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30726410', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30726410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30726410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30726410' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30726410\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30726410', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30726410_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30726410_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30696287\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GeneralGriefus\/recommended\/39680\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"87737368\">\u272aGeneral Griefus<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 54.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is amazing!
