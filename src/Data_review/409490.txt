You must survive in this strange place long enough in the hopes that your memories or some answers will come back to you. <br>Once you start the game you'll find yourself in a small wooden house with only an axe, hammer and pickaxe. You'll also find a little produce growing near your house but other than that, it's just you and your tools. You have main stats that you'll need to monitor which are health and energy and without keeping these full you'll die very quickly. Energy depletes over the day and can be regained by eating raw or cooked food, and Life will drop as you're attacked and can be refilled by using medicinal herbs. Keep an eye on these because once you die it's game over and you'll have to restart entirely but since the maps are procedurally generated, each run will be a little different.<br><br>You'll soon find that the world you're in is not a peaceful one and you'll need to find some way to protect yourself against those you encounter. Your first priority will be finding yourself some resources and crafting the basics such as a crafting table, oven, bed and a sword (though, maybe not in this order). You can easily find trees for wood and large areas of stone for any ore and stone needs you might have along with many other useful items either growing in the wild or dropped from mobs but you'll need to be careful; there is no map in Rogue Harvest so you'll only have your footsteps (which are marked on the ground) to retrace. Once you have your basics you'll need to  craft yourself a weapon fairly quickly so you have a little defence and you'll also want to expand your shelter. The rest is up to you.<br><br>As you interact with the world during resource gathering and combat you'll find yourself slowly levelling up which increases your stats. You have four categories which can be increased and these are Life Points, Energy Points, Luck and Souls but you don't get to allocate your stat points yourself, they are automatically distributed across the board evenly with each level.<br><br>The developer is very active with new updates every few weeks or so and engages regularly with the community on the steam discussion boards. I had a small issue with achievements and within a day I had a friendly and very helpful reply which was a pleasant surprise. Even though the game has a clear direction the developer is open to ideas, tips and feeedback on one of the threads and once again the dev is active there and seems to take things on board. <br>But I do feel obligated to state there isn't masses and masses of content currently. Though you can craft and build things you are limited in those options. The resources don't go much further than wood, stone, ores, a few items animals and mobs can drop a few different types of vegetation. Since the game is in Early Access I am sure we'll see a little more content as development goes on though I don't know how long it plans to remain in development. I also believe the developer is adding a little more to the story (I got this from the Early Access information on the front page so I could be wrong).<br><br>I have a few issues I've encountered. The graphics are something awful if you play them on a large screen. Now this is just my opinion but reading the tutorial alone was an unpleasant experience and it didn't get much better from there. There are no options to change your resolution and I am unsure on if the developer plans to add this so you can either play in windowed for a slightly better experience or you'll have to suck it up. There are also issues with seeing items on the ground. The small pieces of stone that drop after breaking a large rock blend into the stone floor and combining that with your footsteps dotted everywhere become impossible to clearly see. My second issue is the movement because right now it's clunky and doesn't seem to actually do what I want it to half of the time which has caused me some unnecessary deaths. My guy will mine the wrong rocks, not attack in the correct direction sometimes and for some reason get caught in walls and drawn towards them whilst walking.<br><br><b>Overall I'd like to see a little more content in Rogue Harvest but the base of the game so far is very good and tons of fun. It's very reminiscent of games like Terraria and Minecraft with less focus on creative building and more on the story. For $6 it's an easy buy and I hope the developer stays active because it's certainly something I'll want to revisit when completed.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22842882', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22842882' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22842882\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22842882' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22842882\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22842882', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22842882_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22842882_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23777376\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/de_pr1\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"91562738\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/6705de8a975e7dd381710eefeadf5135153f24da.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/6705de8a975e7dd381710eefeadf5135153f24da.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/67\/6705de8a975e7dd381710eefeadf5135153f24da_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/de_pr1\/\" data-miniprofile=\"91562738\">PR1DE &gt;iBP Holo 2014<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/de_pr1\/games\/?tab=all\">141 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/de_pr1\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/de_pr1\/recommended\/409490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Rogue Harvest was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Rogue Harvest for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Rogue Harvest Review<\/div>A great looking indie title headed in the right direction and with potentially compelling storyline, but seems to lack innovation.  Rogue Harvest is the top-down equivilant of Minecraft and Stardew Valley.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>The player must survive for as long as possible.  The player must gather resources during the day to craft items in order to keep themselves alive and protect themselves from monsters at night.  <br><br>Monsters are much more powerful than those found in most survival games.  These monsters can break the walls of your home and storm the house, therefore overwhelming and killing the player.  The player's &quot;energy&quot; meter will keep track of the player's food intake.  The player can choose to consume anything from leaves and flowers to good rabbit meat.<br><br>The player's home is more or less the only safe haven during the night, and it is as terrifying as it is brutal.  The game is permadeath and the player must struggle to keep the monsters out of the house my strengthening his defences and crafting swords to survive the night.  Rogue Harvest has a harsh difficulty spike as the player's time will mostly be spent on fortifying their homes at night, rather than exploring the vast open world which it has to offer.<br><br>Once the player has either killed enough NPCs or gathered a sufficient amount of resources, the player will level up.  Enhancing maximum HP and energy.  The player also collects these &quot;souls&quot; from killed NPCs.  As of now, these souls serve no purpose, but I'd imagine the developers have something planned for them.  Personally, I see the game following the path of Dark Souls, with the player meeting other NPCs offering services in exchange for souls.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+Familiar gameplay mechanics<br>+A good challenge for the &quot;hardcore survivalist&quot;<br>+Teases a story with depth and enough potential<br>+Features a character level progression system<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>-Absurd difficulty spikes<br>-Monsters need balancing<br>-Lacking innovation<br>-No multiplayer<br>-No trading cards<br>-Janky controls<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion<\/div>Rogue Harvest is a great early access indie title and from what I can tell, it is still making great progress.  The game can sometimes be far too difficult for its own good and seems to takes far too many key elements and mechanics from other popular survival and RPG genres without introducing enough of its own to compensate for it.  The controls are janky, with the player only being able to effectively control the character using the mouse.  Pressing two keys at the same time will keep the player going straight as opposed to causing the character to walk diagonally.  <br><br>Rogue Harvest has yet to show what it truly has to offer, but the game is slightly above average in its current build. I recommend it as it's cheap and still holds a lot of potential down the road.<br><br><b>Rating: 12\/20<\/b><br><br>This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/elitegives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Elite Giveaways<\/a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23777376', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23777376' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23777376\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23777376' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23777376\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23777376', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23777376_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23777376_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22947653\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darthvarda\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"92146430\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e72ffde60fc02fb60ff548ca297e484c1e843c29.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e72ffde60fc02fb60ff548ca297e484c1e843c29.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e72ffde60fc02fb60ff548ca297e484c1e843c29_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darthvarda\/\" data-miniprofile=\"92146430\">The Doctor \/ Varda<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darthvarda\/games\/?tab=all\">1,628 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darthvarda\/recommended\/\">55 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/darthvarda\/recommended\/409490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Rogue Harvest was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Rogue Harvest for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSomething happened. You wake up in a forest. Now you have to survive! Run, the ents are coming!<br><br>This is a great game and try to be cautious, surviving the first night won't be the best. I started to think the best way is just running for your life. This is a complicated survival game or complicated and funny survival game where you have to create the best shelter to avoid the enemies at night. Yeah, they are not so great at day but the skeletons.. and other things, you know. They going to destroy your shelter. Now you know!<br><br> *Fluffing Clouds*<br><br>Surviving here means you have to cut trees, look for herbs, apples, mining and all thins to create a great city. No, just a shelter, OK. My goal was creating a castle, but I can barely survive for a night. Ah, don't get lost in the forest. I told you! Oh, you got lost. Pity. There's no map.<br><br>Did I mention cut trees? Greenpeace won't like this game. But's the only way to get some apples, crafting, shelter, etc. So sorry Greenpeace! <br><br>And I have to kill some fauna to avoid starving. Oh, I'm starving! How can I make a fire? Ok, that would be easy I hope. Ah, you have to find the items for that. Sorry.. At night temperature goes down. In case, you could make a fire just try not to destroy your own shelter. Happened to me. There is some kind of ugly flowers called fire splitters, that could help you to create fire. They gonna though fire to you and causing a fire in the whole forest. Ok, maybe is too much but they are dangerous!<br><br>*breeding the rabbits*<br><br>Crafting is easy, the first thing you need is a good shelter. If you are lucky you'll find a lot of stones to create stone walls, which are harder to destroy by the evil enemies at night. Get some medicinal plants just in case, beware of the flowers! Most of them are poisonous.<br><br>And remember: none of the shelters are safe. Those skeletons are better miners than you!<br><br><b>Things I like!<\/b><br><br>- It's a realistic way to survive, except zombies and living plans of course<br>- The creepy music, especially at night<br>- You have a lot of things to get and craft. Yes, this is a game for crafters<br>- The tutorial is quite good<br><br><b>Thigs I'd love to be implemented<\/b><br>- The chance of saving without quitting. I have to quit every time I save.<br>- Respawn. Yes, I know the spirit of the game but not all gamers love getting mad every time you got killed.<br>- Maybe explain more the intro of the game. The plane. Maybe a crash? Is it hard to say goodbye? I'd love to know more about that.<br><br><br>I like a lot Rogue Harvest. I get killed every time and I restart again and again.

Don't let the graphics mislead you, actual game mechanics provide a depth to the game that is not immediately apparent.<br><br>In terms of genre, RH is an hybrid of sorts (featuring elements of survival, RPG, and rogue-like sandbox elements). It features crafting + building on an randomly-generated open world, where you must explore and strive to stay alive. The story starts out vague, and must be uncovered as you progress. In order to survive for longer periods of time, you'll need to learn from each failed attempt... improve bit by bit, even on aspects that in other games you take for granted (note to self: beware open flames near flammable stuff). <br><br>And so began my first playthroughs of the game. I had fun, and as usual took a few notes regarding gameplay elements and bugs I had found, heading over to the game's forum to provide some feedback. Genetix, the game developer, promptly responded, showing not only that he cared about the people that play his game but also about their actual experience of it. Each item was addressed, with suggestions being discussed and bugs noted (some were already being addressed).<br><br>So, not only is the game promising, it is also quite refreshing to see developers take the time to interact positively with fans in order to improve the game. The feeling that feedback has impact on how the game will evolve makes gamers more invested in its future.<br><br>Will be playing again, and look forward to future updates.\t\t\t\t\t<div

similar to other survival games like Terraria, where your main goal is to survive and you must go out collect resources, fight monsters, then come back to cook \/ craft and survive the horrors of the night.<br>+ Crafting in this game is much easier than others, I never had to look up a wikipedia page on how to do something, even without a tutorial I had a good sense of what I was doing. <br>+ An in-game guide-book that very quickly teaches you everything you need to know if you are new to the genre.<br>+ Graphically I thought the game looked surprisingly good<br>+ Building was also very easy, walls, floor, and doors is all you really need.<br>+ A mystery story where you go out and find wreckage from a plane and your character experiences flash backs while looking for a girl.<br>+ Monsters can be quite challenging as it's not easy to regain your health, so you have to be careful. <br><br><b>This game is in Early Access so don't take these negatives too seriously<\/b><br>- The game is currently pretty basic at the moment, not a whole lot to craft or build.<br>- I think there should be more places to explore, perhaps some caves, dungeons, bosses, new areas, etc.<br><br>~ I think this game would benefit if it had a co-op mode.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed it, it's definitely worthy of a few hours of fun and exploration.\t\t\t\t\t<div

id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y0WpAsFLHtU&amp;feature<\/a><br><br>Anyways, onto the review. Rogue Harvest was developed and published by Genetix, and was released on November 5th 2015. It\u2019s genres are Action, Adventure, Open World, Rogue-like, Procedural Generation, and RPG.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Rogue Harvest is an open-world rogue like exploration game and those types of games in my mind are absolutely amazing.<br><br>When I first played Rogue Harvest, the very first thoughts in my mind was Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Don't Starve. Personally, I have never played Stardew Valley, but if you compare Rogue Harvest to Stardew Valley, you can see some interesting similarities in the art style. In my experience, Rogue Harvest connects very well with Don't Starve. While I have not played Don't Starve, I have played Don't Starve together, which is the exact same thing as Don't Starve just multiplayer. The biggest differences between Don't Starve Together and Rogue Harvest are, well,<br>obviously the graphics,pixel art vs a hand drawn style, lack of content, and modding capability.<br><br>In Rogue Harvest, the worlds are massive and procedurally generated, and mixed with it's rogue-like element, every playthrough is different.<br><br>The controls for Rogue Harvest are for the most part very good. However, when you first start the game, the controls are very confusing, but once you have enough time playing it'll get better. <br><br>When you play Rogue Harvest, you must keep an eye on your health, energy, and surroundings. If you run out of energy, your character begins to starve to death. If you aren't paying attention to your surroundings, monsters have a tendency to sneak up on your and could easily end your playthrough. <br><br>Crafting in Rogue Harvest was very easy, and compared to some other games that include crafting, Rogue Harvest had a very straight forward crafting system. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Audio &amp; Soundtrack<\/div>The soundtrack for Rogue Harvest is very, well, interesting. The sound effects are a little bit annoying, but are bareable. The music is what I find so interesting about the game. For copyright purposes, I will not be playing the music in question, but it sounds a lot like creative commons orchestral music. However, I may be wrong, and the musician is just really talented. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div>The graphics in Rogue Harvest are very visually pleasing, and aren't hard on the eyes, however, the sprites are enlarged in a very awkward way, and it stands out. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Storyline<\/div>The story for Rogue Harvest is a confusing one. Your character is nameless, and is in some sort of accident. You wake up in a hut with some tools and a little farm.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Developer Recommendations<\/div>The developer is very active and updates the game almost every week.<br><br> The downsides to the game are the really short day and night cycles. The days are short, and don't give you much time to harvest and explore before nightfall. The night is short and isn't long enough to provide any real excitement. The story is very confusing and bland, like the story of The Forest watered down. Another change I'd make to the game, although not a downside, would be multiplayer implementation.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Thoughts<\/div>Rogue Harvest is an interesting top-down survival horror game. Your goal is to survive and build your home in order to prolong the life-span of your storyless character.<br><br>Rating:<br>Graphics: 7.2\/10<br>Audio: 7\/10<br>Gameplay: 7.6\/10<br>Overall: 7.3\/10<br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Enjoy my review?

You're trying to hunt for food and resources, while every other creature hunts for you.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay:<\/div>You control a nameless character that just experienced a planecrash. You wake up in a small house with a set of basic tools (pickaxe, hammer, axe) outside. From now on your only objective is to survive. You have to keep an eye on your energy and life meters, energy depletes on its own, so you have to stuff yourself with food whenever you can, cause when it reaches zero, you starve to death. Life gets depleted when you get hit by an enemy, you can get some life back by eating herbs or keeping a high energy level.<br>The land is inhabitated by a lot of unfriendly and vicious creatures, like fire flowers (no, you can't collect them, it's not SMB), walking mushrooms, and bunnies. Even worse enemies spawn at night, scary skeletons, etcetera. Make sure to kill lots of them, you can loot many important items out of them.<br>You have three basic tools: Axe for chopping wood, Hammer for destroying walls, Pickaxe for almost everything else. You can also craft weapons, like a sword, boomerang or a bow. Make sure to craft one of them, a woodaxe is not a perfect weapon for killing enemies.<br>Building a sturdy shelter is your main defense against the creatures of the night. Make sure to add extra walls constantly: enemies can and will destroy them while trying to get to you.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics:<\/div> While I like the 16bit-like style of the game, I can't stand how poorly enlarged the sprites and menus are. I keep touching my glasses to see if they are still on my nose, cause the graphics are so blurry. What I liked though, was that your character's footsteps and blood of fallen enemies don't disappear for a long while: you can use this to your advantage by following your footsteps back to your home, just make sure not to stray too far, there is no map and it sucks to get lost in the middle of night.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound:<\/div> All sound effects are pretty normal, nothing to say about them. Music is meh, I muted it after 15 minutes because it was putting me to sleep. Some tracks vary in recording quality, especially the new game song sounds like something ported out of an early PS1 game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Controls:<\/div>Walking sideways sucks. I've died 3 times because of that. That's the biggest issue, the rest of the controls are alright. You have a menu where you can craft\/equip items and also mute music\/sfx. LMB performs action on item that you are currently holding, so using a carrot makes you eat it, using a sword makes you swing it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusion:<\/div> An interesting game. What it lacks in sound and graphics, it makes up with its ominous atmosphere and open world. Game was putting me on edge constantly, because I could die at every given moment. Sudden flashbacks to a plane crash were unnerving me even more. Nights are REALLY dark and enemies can kill you in mere seconds. Medicine gives very little of your health back, and you have to constantly hunt for food. This game doesn't funk around.<b> I recommend it to every one that likes a challenge and old-school games that throw you right in the world without explaining much. If you like autosaves, difficulty selection and regenerating health: stay away.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21981469', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21981469' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21981469\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21981469' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21981469\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21981469', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21981469_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21981469_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24290531\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031923330\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71657602\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031923330\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71657602\">Niall87<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031923330\/games\/?tab=all\">628 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031923330\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031923330\/recommended\/409490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Rogue Harvest was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlmost impossible, but it's that almost that will keep you coming back for more punishment as you think you've finally figured it out, only to die again. <br>Rogue Harvest is a permadeath  death-mill. It's basically an electronic version of heroin. <br>If you intend on playing it, then you must accept the fact you'll die repeatedly, and probably on the first night too, but you'll be back, better than before, but perhaps also cockier, and just as you're wiping out a mob of undead and goblins, you'll stumble into a fire or be hit from behind by a mushroom forcing you to start over again. <br>As a general review Rogue Harvest is very similar in style to Don't Starve, but a bit less polished, and the art work is not as good.

The game is enjoyable enough in and off itself. The mechanics are simple to get into, the gameplay is easy enough to understand and controls are simple.<br><br>So i'll get to the bulletpoints of my experience<br><br>Gameplay: Enjoyable and simple to get into, mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn. The craftiing itself feels like it's standing on a solid base and the enemy variation is fairly decent from what i saw. One minor complaint is that the survival element is not accentuated enough in comparison to the combat. It's to hack and slashy and to little survival, but this is still just a minor complaint.<br><br>Artstyle: Enjoyable and simple, doesn't do more than it needs to do. Some more detail on certain enemies like mushrooms and such would be wanted from my end seeing the larger enemies and the detail they have. But overall a positive impression of the artstyle.<br><br>Sotry: This is what makes the game stick out, the story is compelling anf interesting, by far the best aspect of the game.
