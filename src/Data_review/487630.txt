Dev team has had their fair share of atmospheric projects on Steam and I\u2019m pleased to notice that all that previous experience was put to good use and ultimately gave us such a wonderful example of independent gaming.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Relaxing games are a well needed niche in video gaming. Every single gamer out there needs to unwind at some point, from the action-orientated titles we play on a regular basis. And as gaming history has already proved, sometimes you can find comfort even in the most simple gameplay mechanics, not even relying on a solid storyline. Calling Lantern a \u201csimple game\u201d would be a mistake though. I\u2019m no stranger to this particular niche since I enjoyed playing similar titles on my PS3 Slim, a few years back. Okami HD, Flower and Journey were all excellent games and a well deserved breath of fresh air within a PSN game library that otherwise thrived on relatively violent action\/adventure types. Sadly, since those aforementioned games may never debut onto Steam or on PC altogether, we are stuck ever seeking alternatives. The game I am reviewing today is a worthy contender to such a distinction. Much like Okami, it also relies heavily on a painting mechanic. <br><br>While the Nintendo\/Sony exclusive sported a cel-shaded engine, in Lantern we have a more common, large pixel style over fully 3D environments. Alas, both games inspire themselves from Asian mythology, a topic seldomly approached in contemporary titles. Not much of a story to spoil here and I won\u2019t be doing it anyways. Suffice to say, you control the eponymous lantern that must bring back color and joy to a gloomy fictional land that is in dire need to shed its far too many shades of gray. Controlling the lantern is easy to master and the difficulty ladder never climbs, so to speak. No real challenge but then again, this isn\u2019t meant to feature any sort of combat option. Get used to this idea and enjoy travelling the large stages that offer enough diversity from one another, to soften the blow from the fact that you only have as many levels as there are seasons within a temperate climate on Earth. That is four, indeed. You start within Summer and progress from there onwards to Autumn, Winter and finally Spring. All in all, if you\u2019re through enough in your painting skills, you should clock about five hours of total gameplay. Not a lot and replay value may not be of the best kind in this case. But it\u2019s gonna be a memorable trip, I assure you. Proof for this lies in the several dozen screenshots I felt compelled to take, within the short timespan of just a few hours of gameplay. Biased or not, I enjoyed the game and appreciated its departure from multiple objectives-focused games on Steam. In Lantern you have your work cut out for you and you can progress at your own set pace. No rush, no enemies (not even time, our constant real life foe) and the perfect getaway for those that dream of the Far East.<br><br>Now, I did notice some folks complained in their reviews for Lantern, that the VR support is not  well implemented, or that it causes nausea or something. Let\u2019s get this straight, Virtual Reality headsets are years ahead of showing their true potential. If you ask me, nowadays you just have these overpriced prototypes and you really get to pay the privilege of trying out something that\u2019s only about to become affordable in a couple of years and especially only after more games have \u201cmatured\u201d enough to accept VR as more than just a passing fad. It might be spectacular and I am glad that Lantern\u2019s developer is a forward thinker. But was the VR implementation really necessary here? You\u2019ll have to be the judge of that since Virtual Reality doesn\u2019t pose an interest to me now or in the forseeable future.<br> <br>No one can deny Lantern\u2019s novelty appeal despire being a 3D pixelated title, in the vein of several games already present on the Steam Store. What truly helps it stand out is not the colors and shapes, but their clever mix within the gameplay and the central role played here by diversity in opposition to the initially monochromatic levels. The soundtrack could have used a few more tunes for good variation but even as they are now, you won\u2019t be disappointed.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Beautful art style and level design<br>+ Soothing visuals and relaxing soundtrack<br>+ VR support<br>+ Steam Achievements &amp; Trading Cards<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- A far too brief experience<br>- No control rebinding<br><br> <div class=\"bb_h1\">Result \/ Final thoughts<\/div>Lantern proved to be as blissful a virtual journey as it could ever get by 2016\u2019s PC gaming standards. It doesn\u2019t need to revolutionize anything in order to entertain and relax an audience that has pretty much seen it all. Beauty lies in simplicity more often than not.<br><br><b>Rating 90\/100<\/b><br> <br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/ImperialReviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Imperial Reviews<\/a>, through the generous contribution of <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/redhillcro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >RedHill<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28240721', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28240721' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28240721\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28240721' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28240721\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28240721', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28240721_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28240721_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26620175\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"24770364\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/23\/23407ebf3b29c1d3cc14f73bf38abf50d19799fd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24770364\">seph.au<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/games\/?tab=all\">8,746 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/recommended\/\">326 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/seph_au\/recommended\/487630\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSimilar to &quot;Flower&quot; on PSN, great for relaxing after a long day. :)<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yrywdIEwm6Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yrywdIEwm6Q<\/a><br>Played through one of the 4 worlds which lasted around an 40minutes, had I been given directions it would halve that time. Painting towns to life is the primary objective and the first level also gave me the task of finding hidden obelisks. Once collected it deciphered a message on a central pillar, not unlike what you might find in a fortune cookie. Video options provided enough that it should run reasonably on lower end systems and did support 4k+  resolutions. Gamepad would be recommend though I had no problems using mouse and keyboard. No rebind options were required as the game has simple 2 button controls.<br><br>Price is about right. While it may be short in length, certainly has some replayability.

Don't see this as something negative, Lantern is an adventure\/environment game that incites your interpretation. In my view, your job is to bring color back to the world around you, out of love for a woman. Controlling literally an oriental lantern, you float through the scenery, bringing colors. You have two &quot;powers&quot;, if you can call it that. Clicking the left mouse button you &quot;explode&quot; colors in a large area and clicking the right button you have kind of boost that lasts for a few seconds. The game is open world but there are places that you only enter if you color all the lanterns of the scenario. The game has subtle indications on screen about the controls, which come out as soon as you take action.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphic<\/div>Incredible, all drawned, with bright colors. Relaxing and light.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Plot <\/div>As I said, Lantern is a game that incites you to interpret. Has no narrator, talks or even texts. It has cutscenes only with slides of facts. It's up to you to write the story inside.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Soundtrack <\/div>Original and orchestrated.

Lantern is an indie adventure and open world game. Believe it or not, you actually play as a lantern. The main goal and purpose of this lantern is to restore color to the dull and colorless Chinese landscape. It is unclear as to why the land has turned into this dreary state, but it is your sole responsibility to bring back the vibrant colors and life that once covered this land.<br><br>With the lively colors and the soothing cultural music and sounds, Lantern is stimulating for both the eyes and the ears. As you gravitate and lead the lantern throughout the Chinese mountains and villages, there are secrets and hidden objectives throughout the different levels for you to discover.  The game is very smooth and relaxing, it\u2019s a great game to play if you want to wind down and forget all about the worries you might have.<br><br>There is a level for each of the four seasons. Each season has its own personal layout, architecture, and secrets. You must cover all grounds in each season to unlock the next level, which can become very tedious. The lantern you play as does have two power-ups that you may use every once in a while which assists you to complete your tasks much faster. One power-up allows you to move the lantern at a faster rate for roughly 30 seconds. And the other power-up can be used to return color to a large radius surrounding your lantern. Each of these powers can be used every 30 seconds to one minute.<br><br>For the full review go here - <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gamingcypher.com\/lantern-review-pc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.gamingcypher.com\/lantern-review-pc\/<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29930564', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29930564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29930564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29930564' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29930564\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29930564', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29930564_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29930564_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/487630\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 21 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28240721","26620175","26715450","29930564"]}
