Nothing else has come as close to that feeling of flight that this game captures. There's no timer which makes the exploration of the map feel free and relaxed. There's not much to do, but I love the way the flying feels so much that I've just been replaying the demo level over and over.<br><br>I actually tried this off of my friend's account, but liked the way this game felt so much that I had to buy it for myself. Anyone who has ever had that dream about flying should buy this just to see how it compares. Just be prepared for some quirks and a learning curve. It takes some practice to get this to really feel natural, but once you get it it's magnificent. <br><br>The controllers do tend to float away if you fly with the duck for an extended period, but after I got comfortable with the controls I really stopped caring where my controllers were. I understand the game isn't even technically released, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's fixed soon. There are also some weird instances of pellets not registering a hit, and the duck flying through balloons, but nothing really jarring that upset the gameplay other than the floating controllers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25457396', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25457396' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25457396\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25457396' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25457396\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25457396', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25457396_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25457396_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28499610\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133109927\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"172844199\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/39cfc605abd8f444e852dad579b519f30879f118.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/39cfc605abd8f444e852dad579b519f30879f118.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/39\/39cfc605abd8f444e852dad579b519f30879f118_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133109927\/\" data-miniprofile=\"172844199\">huntingwabbits0<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133109927\/games\/?tab=all\">92 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133109927\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133109927\/recommended\/511690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(Updated 9th Mar 2017)<br><br>When I first reviewed Duck Force I gave it a Thumbs Down because of what I felt was a poorly implemented representation of a certain bodily function. Thanks to a recent update this issue has been well and truly put to bed. Not only that, but the dev has made available a free demo, so there is now officially NO REASON for duckophiles (or those who are merely duck-curious) to not give Duck Force a go.<br><br>And give it a go you should. Duck Force is a VR game with nice cartoony graphics, decent (and amusing) audio and a novel control method which is difficult to describe, because there is no other game I know of that I can compare it to. Basically, you point (in 3D space) your Vive controller in the direction you want the duck to fly. You can also make the duck instantly do a 180, or speed him up (with the awesome power that is DUCK FARTS) or slow him right down (with the power of I don't know what. It's probably just a duck thing. Go ask a duck.)<br><br>The duck can also, in much the same way as a real life duck, shoot projectiles out of its head, which can obliterate environmental hazards, particulary wooden structures with coins inside them, which makes them easier for the duck to collect. Collecting coins is such an original and unique concept, I am surprised that it has never been implemented in any other game.<br><br>You can also shoot down bunny rabbits, who are apparently hostile towards the duck, so they deserve to die. The duck's military capabilities enable it to to mete out tough justice against the rabbits, and rightly so.<br><br>Your duck will however die, and die often. It's easy to die because coming into contact with anything which is not collectible or fly-throughable will result in a dead duck. Which is as funny as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, the duck just splats against some inanimate object while a couple of yellow feathers float forlornly to the ground. It's OK though, because your duck is immortal, just like a real duck, and you can shoot him back into the air with a quick flick of a trigger finger. You can bet that vengeance will be his. <br><br>There is other stuff to do as well, like flying through rings, which is fun, and lets you test out your flying skills. Real ducks do this kind of thing all the time, can you elevate your skills to that level? Probably not, as ducks are an awesome force of nature, but it's something to aspire to.<br><br>TL;DR<br><br>You should AT LEAST try the demo. It's free ffs. If you don't like it, accept that you hate ducks, life and yourself and go play some lame dating sim. Otherwise, buy Duck Force and support the guy who is doing good things in VR, listens to customer feedback, and, most importantly, LIKES DUCKS.<br><br>PS My original review of Duck Force appears below, I gave it a Thumbs Down at the time. I've left it in for historical reasons, but you can pretty much ignore its content because it's mainly just me whining about one thing that has since been fixed. Read it if you want, but it will be a complete waste of time. Time that would be better spent downloading the Duck Force demo and becoming one with your inner duck. <br><br><br><br>****************** START ORIGINAL REVIEW *********************<br><br>I bought this game primarily because it's got a duck in it, and I feel that devs who make games with ducks in them are deserving of my support.<br><br>There is a lot to like about this game, the graphics look good, the flight mechanics are weird but OK, and of course, the protagonist is a duck. Unfortunately I just can't recommend this right now because of one fatal flaw - it is, literally too &quot;in your face&quot;.<br><br>See, the best way to play this is by flying around with the duck. He flies along right in front of you which is fine, but the problem is that when you speed him up he FARTS RIGHT IN YOUR FACE!<br><br>Now, I don't have a problem with fart based locomotion, it beats the hell out of lame teleport mechanics. But this really makes my skin crawl. There's a long smoky looking fart trail which extends from the duck's butt and seems to go right through my forehead, and it hangs around longer than a real life fart. I try and duck (hehe) out of the way, but of course you can't, because you're following right behind the duck. The feeling is hard to describe, but it is very unpleasant and makes the game unplayable, for me at least.<br><br>You don't HAVE to follow the duck, you can just let him fly off into the distance and continue to control him, but it's not nearly as accurate (you have to be accurate in this game to pick up coins, etc) and more importantly, it's not nearly as much fun.<br><br>I do like this game, but the face-farts are unfortunately a deal-breaker for me. If the farty vapour trail could be turned off or redirected below face level then this would get an instant recommendation... but as it is, even my bias for duck based games is not enough to get this game a thumbs-up.<br><br>****************** END ORIGINAL REVIEW *********************\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28499610', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28499610' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28499610\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28499610' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28499610\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28499610', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28499610_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28499610_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/511690\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25457396","28499610"]}
