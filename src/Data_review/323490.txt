The graphics are watercolor-esque style.<br>4:3 aspect ratio (Not widescreen).  Full-screen is achieved by hitting the windows maximize button.<br><br><u>Story:<\/u><br>The game summary mentions 7 princesses.  Only 3 are romanceable.  A 4th girl, the head maid, is romanceable with the addition of the DLC.  The news states that the DLC is included with each copy, however I'm not sure if this will apply in the future. <br><br>While the story flows for the most part, there are moments where the transition is abrupt and the flow is broken.  I'm not sure if it's deliberate.<br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span><br>For instance, there was a scene where you're teaching Finn and she falls asleep.  Then, when you try to wake her she's terrified.  For all of 2-3 clicks.  Then suddenly she's calm and apologetic.   You get the feeling she's either schizophrenic or there's a step missing.<br><br>Then, there is another scene where you're at the training hall on the first day, and you find her acting really different...extremely confident I suppose.  She asks you to teach her like you promised and you ask her whether she has androphobia.  You try to comfort her...<br><br>...and cut to a childhood memory of Finn's.  You wake up after that memory is complete.<br><br>How did you get from the training hall to your bed?  What happened in the middle?<br><br>I haven't noticed this on the other girl's routes yet...I wonder if Finn's route is a bad end or a joke route.<\/span><\/span><br><br><u>Sound:<\/u><br>Music is peaceful, appropriate, and doesn't feel repetitive.  <br><br>The battle music is rather interesting.  It's the first time I heard battle music arranged this way.<br><br>Voices are in Chinese.  Voice acting seems to be a hit or miss thing.  (Whoever's VA'ing Dyanna sounds like her mouth is right on the microphone.  Or maybe there's an echo in the background?)  (Whoever's VA'ing Leira and her maid does a good job though.)<br><br>Main character (you) is unvoiced.<br><br><u>Gameplay:<\/u><br>Visual Novel.  Branching appears to be determined by a combination of choices and the number of times you visit a girl.<br><br>There's a &quot;dictionary&quot; button at the top of the screen.  I'm not sure what it's for since I can't use it yet.<br>The &quot;return&quot; button returns you to the previous set of choices.  Failing that, it returns you to the start of the scene. <br><br><u>Translation:<\/u><br>Much improved since it was released last year.  The prologue makes sense now.<br><br>The translation itself does not appear to be machine translated, i.e. since the writing takes the context of the scene into account.<br><br><br><u>Saving \/ Loading:<\/u><br>For those of us that like to make a save point for each branch, you get 40 save slots.  39 are traditional slots.  1 is reserved for quicksave.<br><br>You can only quicksave when you reach the screens where you're picking the girl to visit.  I think the solution is to quicksave, then visit each girl in succession and save normally.<br><br><u> Misc Notes <\/u><br>My firewall picked up an outgoing connection from the game when it starts.  I blocked it and the game seems to run fine.  Dunno what it's for though.<br><br><u> Conclusion <\/u><br>I'll recommend for now since the game itself seems interesting.  I'll need to update this review as I play more later.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13335082', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13335082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13335082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13335082' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13335082\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13335082', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13335082_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13335082_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13696810\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"119449906\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/464e3b491eaa86902b43d37fc64bc6540f550163.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/464e3b491eaa86902b43d37fc64bc6540f550163.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/46\/464e3b491eaa86902b43d37fc64bc6540f550163_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/\" data-miniprofile=\"119449906\">jfietkau<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/games\/?tab=all\">8,176 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/recommended\/\">13 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jfietkau\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 29, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou are a proud and successful military general, you have won many wars and conquered many kingdoms. But during the deciding battle you make a grave mistake, and you lose everything. Shamed and shunned, you return home to your emperor. How can you ever redeem yourself? As it turns out, the emperor already has a new task in mind.<br><br><b>Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana<\/b> is a romance-themed visual novel set in a post-medieval fantasy world. You are a humiliated ex-general and your new job is to teach the art of fencing to the seven princesses of the kingdom.<br><br>The first thing you'll likely notice when you're looking at <i>Oblivious Garden<\/i> for the first time is the <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=359715753\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >unique<\/a> and <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=364216475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >stylish<\/a> <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=355183772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >artwork<\/a>. The character portraits and CGs are gorgeous without exception and the gothic\/baroque-inspired character designs mesh surprisingly well with the pastel-focused watercolor art style. The VN has a refined visual identity that sticks out of the crowd and will secure it a second look from many prospective readers. The backgrounds are unfortunately of lower quality on average and range from <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=355301185\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >nicely painted landscapes<\/a> to <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=364060851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >crude photo manipulations of rooms<\/a>. The soundtrack is fitting and atmospheric, but a little repetitive. This would have been counteracted by either a bigger selection of tracks or at least less obvious loops (they're not jarring but very apparent after the first few times). There's Chinese voice acting available that complements the character designs pretty well and provides fitting voices to go along with the faces. It has <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/video\/323490\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >a spiffy opening animation<\/a> and the technical aspects (controls, save system etc.) leave little to be desired.<br><br>The story is set in the titular &quot;oblivious garden&quot;, where the emperor has sealed away the seven princesses. The many parallels drawn to the royal courts in 17th century Europe extend not only to the opulent garden itself, but also to the complex social rules and codes governing the interactions between Irell Reis, the ex-military main character, and the princesses residing in the area. Don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy though, I got the impression that the social aspects were influenced at least as much by the developers' Chinese background as by their impression of past European nobility, which is not a problem at all considering it's a fantasy world. While this sort of setting has been attempted before in fiction, it deserves recognition for originality in the realm of visual novels, even though admittedly I am generous with my praise for any setting that is not a Japanese high school.<br><br>In another contrast to the visual novel archetype, the main character is a young adult with a sizable amount of life experience as a military general. Thematically, in accordance with that choice, <i>Oblivious Garden<\/i> does not shy away from the heavy-hitters: Recurring topics are the justifiability of war and violence, the vicious circle of revenge, the guilt of enabling and orchestrating mass slaughter versus &quot;just following orders&quot;, and of course the dichotomy between fate and free will. The VN uses these issues quite expertly in the interactions between the central characters.<br><br>Rounding out the package is a charming little mini game about <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=355351814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >brewing different kinds of tea<\/a> that maybe could have been slightly more forthcoming with its solutions (or maybe I'm just bad at it), but offers a fun break from the plot and an entertaining experience nudging you to perhaps make a nice cup of tea for yourself as well.<br><br>I would have loved to love <i>Oblivious Garden<\/i>. I saw almost all the building blocks needed for a fantastic visual novel, I really liked the art and the concept, the setting seemed unique and interesting. Yet, I can't love it. I can merely bring myself to say that it is pretty good all things considered. That is because <i>Oblivious Garden<\/i> commits my one cardinal sin, the one thing that a visual novel can do that I really cannot forgive: The writing is bad. Or rather, it has its good and even great moments (lots of them in fact) but it just can't sustain a consistent level of quality throughout the whole story. And for a visual novel, that is a huge problem.<br><br>To be clear, I am not talking about the low-quality English script that is rife with grammatical errors and vocabulary mixups. I know this can be a dealbreaker for many of you, so it deserves pointing out, but personally I can usually gloss over shoddy translations easily if I set my mind to it. In any case, it is something that can be fixed by putting the script into the hands of a better qualified translator or at least a native English speaking editor, which I have reason to hope might still happen. There were only one or two spots that I straight up didn't understand for which I would blame the lackluster translation. My main gripes run much deeper.<br><br>But if the writing isn't good, then why do I still give <i>Oblivious Garden<\/i> an overall &quot;thumbs up&quot; rating? There are reasons for that, I like to think they are good ones, and I will tell you all about them, but first I'd like to elaborate on the specific ways in which I consider the writing lacking and the ways in which it actually succeeds, so you can draw your own conclusions about whether or not your opinion would differ from mine and whether the things that bothered me might be non-issues to you.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.notehub.org\/2014\/12\/28\/you-are-a-proud-and-successful-military-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" ><b>(This review turned out to be too long for Steam's character limit, please click here to read the full text...)<\/b><\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13696810', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13696810' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13696810\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13696810' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13696810\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13696810', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13696810_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13696810_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14424485\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198056103942\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"95838214\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dc14b78f52f8919aec380910c4feb9b6abc2ae4e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dc14b78f52f8919aec380910c4feb9b6abc2ae4e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dc14b78f52f8919aec380910c4feb9b6abc2ae4e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198056103942\/\" data-miniprofile=\"95838214\">Cinderblaze3<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198056103942\/games\/?tab=all\">87 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198056103942\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198056103942\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is really a mixed bag. In one hand, the art style of the characters and backgrounds are gorgeous, the music beautiful and relaxing. The romanceable characters are very unique and deep, and I found myself genuinely interested in finding out more about them and they're well being. (Be warned though, if you're planning on choosing Leira as a romance option, you will need A LOT of patience. Her rudeness can be really hard to take, and at some points your perspective will switch to her's, and the game neglects to state this, leading to some confusion.) <br>On the other hand, the translation is absolutely awful, and english-speaking players will need to read a lot of the lines over and over again to understand what's going on, and there are not that many different music tracks in the game, making long playthrough's a little tiring. <br>Oh, and a little advice; even though there are multiple paths to take in the game, you can only choose one path and stick to it. I completed Lin's route, and on my second playthrough, decided to take Leira's path. As mentioned before, Leira can be an exhausting romance choice, as she insults you much more often than shows affection to you, so eventullay, I got sick of it. I thought I would take a break from the *cough*\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665*cough* and visit Lin. And the VN immideatley launched one of the early romance scenes for Lin's story, even though I had never once visited her in the game before, making it very awkward when the main character said, &quot;I know our meetings in the forest have not been a coincidence.&quot; <br>Um, what meetings in the forest?<br>So, I decided to just shrug that weird moment off and go on to the next day... when I was immediatley expelled from the garden and failed the game.<br>In a nutshell; after a certain point in your chosen path, if you even GLANCE at another option in the game, you're hit with a game over instantly. I guess those princesses assumed I was courting them both. You can just imagine how much this ticked me off.<br>The thing is, this ending would be perfectly fine if they had programmed it better, by say, making the player need to visit a princess a certain amount of times before romance with them becomes possible, and then visiting each one with romantic intent, and NOT allowing the game to jump between romantic scenes at random!<br>So when you do remember to visit one and ONLY one princess after a few in-game days, there's still not that many important decisons you can make that greatly affects the outcome, such as in other VN's like Long Live The Queen. The biggest decisons you make is whether to tell Dyanna that she screwed up baking cookies or not. The result: This visual novel takes the word 'novel' a little too seriously, as you passively click the mouse like crazy, following the story in it's own set path.<br>However, if you're an avid reader like me, you can probably look past this lack of interaction and choice as the characters and plot make the ride very engaging, and the game itself is beautiful to look at and listen to. And no matter how bad the translation is, I will always have a blast brewing Finn's head into the princesses tea. (I think that may be another glitch...)<br>So, if you like reading, gorgeous backgrounds, amazing music, anime art styles and suprisingly good romance stories, you'll feel right at home, but I would still recommend waiting for it to go on sale or for the developer's to fix the translation. If you demand important decisions leading to endless possibilties of endings, high interactive content, and freedom of choice, you should look elsewhere for your next VN treasure.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14424485', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14424485' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14424485\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14424485' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14424485\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14424485', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14424485_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14424485_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13687584\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078304977\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"118039249\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31fe24260896176c71eafacd18ed6433ff34e0f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31fe24260896176c71eafacd18ed6433ff34e0f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/31\/31fe24260896176c71eafacd18ed6433ff34e0f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078304977\/\" data-miniprofile=\"118039249\">Jerome<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078304977\/games\/?tab=all\">1,063 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078304977\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198078304977\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 29, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was able to clear one route for Dyanna, Lin, and Finn; three routes for Leira. From this, I do think that a lot of things are lost in translation because of cultural barriers, and to make matters worse the translation is quite terrible; as I read in the forums the translation is now being reviewed.<br><br>Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana is pretty much similar to other VN's, you move around the garden and go to places where you can interact with its characters. Your decisions will direct which storyline you will go through. In some stages of the game you will be asked to prepare a tea, this will lead you to a minigame. You'll decide which ingridients to use, set the temperature and time for brewing. The game may end early if you somehow suddenly got kicked out of the garden (This was how my first game ended). If you were able to do you job well you may be able to proceed to one of the heroine routes.<br><br>I had a hard time understanding it but the story is really good and interesting. The protagonist was presented well,  and some of the characters are pretty unpredictable that you'd be puzzled out on how to interact with them.<br><br>It was a joy listening to the voice acting, there was nothing that I didn't like (This is my first Chinese VN though; I can't understand what they were saying). I like the art and the soundtrack. The OP is what I like the most in this game, I don't know how many times I watched it, really loved the music.<br><br>If you ever find yourself playing this VN, I recommend that you start trying to get to Finn's route first, finish Lin and Leira's before going on to Dyanna. I believe that this is the best way to experience the VN because with this you can have a finale with the Miracle Play.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13687584', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13687584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13687584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13687584' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13687584\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13687584', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13687584_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13687584_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17276769\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerosfallensanity\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"198510422\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6aeee7d61bce1a959138bff2c60f4d1925e45f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6aeee7d61bce1a959138bff2c60f4d1925e45f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6aeee7d61bce1a959138bff2c60f4d1925e45f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerosfallensanity\/\" data-miniprofile=\"198510422\">fallenfromnero<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerosfallensanity\/games\/?tab=all\">9 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerosfallensanity\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerosfallensanity\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">22.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 28, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazing game with an incredible story! Just absolutely fell in love with the characters. Definitely great to break away from the typical VN, no school girls, no stereotypical protagionist, nice break from the usual japanese voice overs with the chinese voice overs. <br><br>I really love how in depth the story is, more of a book than most VNs. Irell is a great protagionist, how haunted he is by his sins and past. I never cared for the protagionists of other VNs, he really stood out from the bunch. <br><br>The voice overs were great, especially Leira's. She really sold the taunting, cruel speaking character, but was also able to sound cheerful when needed. <br><br>The music was superb, recommend buying the soundtrack. <br><br>The girls are easy to fall in love with. I really wanted and wondered why Marian wasn't a choice to fall in love with but after doing Leira's story, I saw why (You'll see why).<br><br>I really liked how the world had religion, magic, and other things but didn't feel the need to go in to depth with it all. <br><br>10\/10. Playing again for sure. For the price of this game and DLC, recommend for anyone who loves VNs or just a great read all together. <br><br><br><br><br><br>PS: Be careful on Leira's story.

Visual novels are a little different but they\u2019re easier for me to relate to because you actually see the characters and don\u2019t have to visualize everything. If you\u2019re a fanatic book reader you probably don\u2019t understand this reasoning because interpreting and visualizing is probably what makes reading a book so magical in the first place. The upside to reading a visual novel is that your choices can effect and influence the story. This differs per game though. But Oblivious Garden <i>is<\/i> such a game. Did I enjoy it ? Let\u2019s find out.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>Reading a book \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a physical one, digital one or interactive one \u2013 requires a lot of patience. You could miss parts of the story just by not paying (enough) attention, which is actually a shame. The story of Oblivious Garden caught my attention and it seemed very interesting to me. That\u2019s why I was eager to give it a try.<br>You play as Irell Reis, a once famous general who is given the task of hosting the next fiesta, where the God will forgive the people who sacrificed themselves on foreign land during the war. You will prepare yourself in the garden of the Emperor, where seven princess live who are going to help and work with you. That\u2019s the short version and it might not be entirely accurate as I usually forget smaller details. So forgive me if I\u2019ve made a mistake.<br>I think it was clear that playing this game is like reading a book, but one that requires interaction from you, the player. You\u2019ll be clicking through the conversations, occasionally making a choice that might affect the story and you\u2019ll even be playing a little minigame where you have to brew tea.<br>You\u2019ll be talking with the seven princesses, along with some other characters, and well, that\u2019s basically all that you\u2019ll do. I\u2019ve played the game two times now but haven\u2019t actually left the garden even once. It\u2019s just non-stop conversing with the main characters. This frustrated me a little because the bigger story was the thing that caught my interest in the first place.<br>Also, it isn\u2019t entirely clear what\u2019s expected of you. As I said I\u2019ve played through the game twice, but every time the game ended prematurely because I seemingly didn\u2019t make the right choices. Both times I\u2019ve selected entirely different answers but that didn\u2019t seem to help. It\u2019s very frustrating if you don\u2019t know what to do and it insults my intelligence by simply ending the story so soon without being able to set things right. I don\u2019t want to replay the entire story over again and mouseclick through a story that I\u2019ve already read. This could\u2019ve been handled in a better way, I think because I\u2019m most certainly not going to play through the story for a third time, without knowing for sure that I can complete the story \u2018correctly\u2019. It might actually have been the tea minigame which didn\u2019t make much sense to me (I was just randomly adding ingredients, for example), but I doubt the game counts things like that as a failure.<br>Unfortunately, the game\u2019s typos and occasional bad grammar didn\u2019t help either. For a game that consists of large pieces of text I actually expect something to proofread it before releasing it to a larger audience. I still understood most sentences\/conversations so it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t make sense of it all. It was just\u2026 distracting.<br>Other than that the writing is pretty good and the story is somewhat interesting. I just expected a little more here.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Audio &amp; Graphics<\/div>The one thing that\u2019s immediately noticeable is how loud the music is when you first start the game. It can, of course, be easily adjusted through the Options menu but it surprised me a little.<br>The music is actually very good and the Japanese voice acting \u2013 even if it\u2019s useless \u2013 seemed accurate but since I don\u2019t actually speak Japanese I\u2019m just guessing here. Still, voice acting isn\u2019t something you see very often in visual novels (I haven\u2019t played <i>that<\/i> many) so it\u2019s absolutely appreciated.<br>The game uses mixed art. Some environments look beautiful and others seem to use a different kind of style, like your own room. Nothing ugly, but, again, distracting. The characters are competently made and what you can expect from a visual novel. This means \u2018childish\u2019 Japanese girls, with big eyes, small mouths and perfect bodies. If only something would try something new. I usually can\u2019t really relate to Japanese\/anime characters.  Still, it\u2019s all very solid and I can\u2019t really complain here. It\u2019s a \u2018love it-or-hate it\u2019 kind of thing.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Length &amp; Replayability<\/div>I\u2019ve already spoken a bit about this in the Gameplay paragraph but the shortest playthrough seemed to take about 2 hours of my time. That is with normal settings so no uberspeedy text. I\u2019ve been told that a \u2018good\u2019 playthrough will take about 4-5 hours of your time so that\u2019s pretty solid. Choices do seem to make a difference, but not much. This means you can replay the game and you might get a different outcome but in my two playthroughs I got the exact same ending. I did notice small variations in the story though. Considering the price I think you get enough gameplay out of it, but to be honest I would wait for a sale. That\u2019s from a person that doesn\u2019t play a lot of visual novels so it might be a different story if you actually do play a lot of these games.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Closing<\/div>Oblivious Garden pulled me in with its interesting story but unfortunately didn\u2019t keep me interested for long. The story stopped short fairly soon and I had no clue what I did wrong. Even during my second playthrough I couldn\u2019t for the life of me see what I did wrong in the first place. <br>The game can absolutely use a little (more) direction, or improve things to make a second (or third, fourth) playthrough worth your time.<br>I have played better and more interesting visual novels during my career as a gamer and therefore I can only recommend to wait for a sale or to just grab one of those others.

This is a CHINESE made and voiced game and buyers should be aware of that before they consider anything else. While it isn't too big of a deal for me, some people on the forums are quite upset about it. <br><br>Graphics\/Art - 5\/10<br>The backgrounds looks horrendous; it's almost like they went into paint and brushed some pictures together. The character models on the other hand look relatively crisp and workable. Some characters have a couple awkward postures and the sprites aren't overly polished compared to something like If My Heart Can Fly, but it's passable.<br><br>Sound\/Music - 9\/10<br>The soundtrack is phenomenal and I'm going to give them props for voicing most if not all of the female lines. That being said, the Chinese voice actors sound quasi-amateurish but compared to most of the VN's on steam that lack any form of voice-acting, it's still a welcome addition.<br><br>Translation - 6\/10<br>This is where the game falls flat. If you are fluent with English and aren't afflicted with any mental handicaps, you will be able to make out ALL of the scripts. BUT, the English translation seems like it was made by people with English as a secondary or tertiary language. It's slightly better than the machine translations I would be getting off Atlas with a modified dicitonary so tbh it's doable. <br><br>A welcome addition to the Steam repertoire of visual novels. I am thrilled that more Chinese made ones are making it onto the market and hope there's more to come. Given the price, this 5-10 hr game is definitely worth it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('13374189', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '13374189' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary13374189\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '13374189' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary13374189\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '13374189', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13374189_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary13374189_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17622851\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75520107\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e7\/e746f96e2661b227000aad95a1dee64c4b3c42b2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75520107\">shiaakuma<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/games\/?tab=all\">924 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/recommended\/\">92 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shiaakuma\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 19, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOf the visual novels I've played, this is probably my favorite so far.<br><br>The artwork is lovely and the character design well done.  The music works well with the setting.  The character voices sound fine to me.  As with all translated VNs, there are some occasional clunks in the text, but I didn't feel it was bad.  I can't comment on the translation like I might with a Japanese VN as I don't speak any dialect of Chinese, but nothing in the text seemed overly hinky that would hint at a poor translation.  <br><br>These are just basic good points you can find in a lot of VNs.<br><br>What really made this one stand out, in my opinion, is the vast difference in the stories for each path.  Most of the VNs I've read have had pretty much the same plot regardless of what path you're trying to follow, with unique scenes and dialogues inserted in based on your choices.  In this case, without spoiling anything, the entire progression of the plot is different.  Each girl's path is written individually so that if you finish, for example, Leila's path and then go back and play Dyanna's path, the story is brand new (and each plot is VERY different from the others).  <br><br>Thanks to the real replayability of this sort of &quot;four-stories-in-one&quot; novel combined with the well-drawn graphics, I can't recommend it enough.  I picked it up on sale but would cheerfully have paid full price for the  amount of playtime and enjoyment I got out of it!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17622851', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17622851' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17622851\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17622851' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17622851\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17622851', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17622851_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17622851_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23112534\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bba93007d0801f75c19b961ecb975e70c67c6847_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/\" data-miniprofile=\"67950451\">Usagi<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/games\/?tab=all\">2,099 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/\">141 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Usako\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">25.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPlaying <i>Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana<\/i> is a beautiful and romantic experience. Set in a far-off magical land, you step into the shoes of Irell Reis, who has been ordered to help tutor seven princesses. Each story route brings with it new adventures and dangers, this simple garden isn\u2019t all that it seems. Become immersed in the lives of the princesses and the rich history of the Magical Empire of Latoy, learn about gods and war as you romance the lady of your choice.<br><br>Each route gives you different parts of the story, but all you know at the start is that you are Irell, a disgraced general defeated in an important battle that cost the lives of thousands of soldiers. The Emperor sees fit to give Irell another chance and he is sent to the Oblivious Garden to be a fencing instructor. The garden is so named as its residents are oblivious to the outside world, and with good reason: The garden is protected by a magical barrier making it more of a prison. On the surface the game might seem like it\u2019s simply about romance but there is a lot of magic in this world and a complicated backstory that is touched on in pieces in each different route. Despite being in the garden with seven princesses you can only romance three of them as well as a maid.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><b>Irell<\/b> - One of the greatest warriors serving under the Emperor, he is a skilled fighter but not so skilled with women. After a devastating loss he is stripped of his titles and banished for three years, only to return for a new mission- to tutor the princesses. He wants to atone for his failure, and help the souls of his fallen soldiers find peace.  Due to these burdens, he spends a great deal of the game depressed. Through his experiences in the garden and his relationships with the princesses, he finds peace of mind and a new future to fight for.<br><br><\/li><li><b>Leira<\/b> - Leira\u2019s route is the simplest, it doesn\u2019t delve too far into magic nor the long history of Latoy, instead it plays more like a traditional dating sim as you work to pursue her. Her backstory is the one most connected to Irell himself and because of her harsh attitude she takes the most work to romance. She is the classic \u201ctsundere\u201d character type though getting to know her explains her personality much more. She is also the focus of the free White Day DLC.<br><br><\/li><li><b>Lin<\/b> - She is the quiet and reserved type, at first seeming standoffish and dull until you get to know her. Of the princesses, her route is the shortest and has the least amount of choices. It does, however, have a good story and I found it to be the most romantic. She is a very skilled swordswoman but rejects the sword because of a deep darkness hidden inside of her. Following her route uncovers some of the history of Latoy and a bit of the Emperor\u2019s true nature but not much.<br><\/li><li><b>Dyanna<\/b> - While Dyanna\u2019s route has less choices than Leira\u2019s, I found it to be the longest. I played this route first because I found her very beautiful but in hindsight it should have been last because of its length and heavy backstory about Latoy. While she and Irell grow close through the story, after you\u2019re done making choices the story continues on explaining her history, her magic and more about the garden and Emperor and Irell himself. It is a pretty heavy story and can seem confusing at first, but the climax is pretty epic.<br><br><\/li><li><b>Finn<\/b> - Gentle Finn is the head maid in the garden and tends to all of the princesses except for Leira who has a personal maid. She knows everything going on but isn\u2019t the gossiping type. She is friendly, kind and adorable throughout every route. Her own route, however, is a bit confusing. I really can\u2019t go into details but it made Finn seem bipolar, it also didn\u2019t seem to accurately portray Lin either but it is the shortest route with the fewest choices.<br><br><\/li><li><b>Intelia, Ereface, Charlotte and Sherle<\/b> - The other princesses in the garden that you cannot romance. Intelia serves as the headmaster of the garden. Ereface prefers to stay in the library, and her magic helps keep the garden beautiful. Charlotte is the daughter of a general and a great fencer. Sherle is the youngest in appearance and in her attitude, usually playing the role of a kid sister. You only really learn more about Ereface and that is through Dyanna\u2019s route.  The others get little face time in the game save for Intelia, who is present in all routes but is by her nature very mysterious.<\/li><\/ul> <br>Since this is a visual novel, the interface is exclusively point-and-click. You read through the story and at times make choices to help move the story in a certain direction. The game has the standard features for this genre; an auto text option, a skip previously seen text option and the ability to scroll back and see past text. You can save, load, remove text from the screen to see pictures fully and the game also auto saves. A nice feature I liked was the dictionary, which is available once you finish any route. It contains facts about Latoy and all of the characters. Another neat feature is the tea-making mini game. Since this game is about refined young ladies, tea takes a high priority, especially in Leira\u2019s route. Through the mini game you can brew different types of tea with ingredients you gain through the story and also through raising your tea-brewing level. The only downside is that the game gives you little or no help on how to figure out how to brew good tea, without a guide you\u2019re probably going to be lost.<br><br>Artwise there is nothing negative that can be said, the art in this game is beyond gorgeous. Every princess looks beautiful, the backgrounds are lovely and the menus and user interfaces are very elegant. The music is also amazing, every melody is beautifully orchestrated and I highly recommend picking up the soundtrack as well. Where the game falters is the voice acting. The main game has voices for the entire female cast while the DLC also adds male voice acting. I found the acting to be fine but the audio quality was inconsistent. At times some voices were loud, some very muffled and no one was at the same level or quality. What was worse was that at times there was no audio where there should be. Lin was apart of Finn\u2019s story route but had no voice acting through most of it, she also missed lines in her own route. There were also times when what the actress said didn\u2019t match with the text on the screen, though not many that I noticed with my very limited knowledge of Chinese.<br><br>Despite some flaws I personally loved playing this game. It was quite lengthy, easily offering 10-20 hours of gameplay to complete everything. There are many Steam achievements to get and also trading cards as well. While at times the story may feel contrived or confusing, I fell in love with the princesses as much as Irell did. My least-favorite princess, Leira, became one of my favorites. The game also has a side story that is free DLC about Leira though her personality is a bit different from the main story and there is added fan service but also more achievements. If you enjoy visual novels then I highly recommend adding <i>Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana<\/i> to your library.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_code\">This review is exclusively written for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/vnvortex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Visual Novel Vortex<\/a>, visit the official site <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/vnvortex.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >here<\/a>!<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23112534', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23112534' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23112534\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23112534' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23112534\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23112534', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23112534_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23112534_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29851330\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ArchmageXin\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"34706697\">ArchmageXin<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you actually know Mandarin, you will realize some part of the story is borderline re-write by the English translators.

The Emperor forgives the former soldier, but sends him into the Oblivious Garden where he meets seven princesses.  Irell must participate in the Miracle Play. But why is this \u201cplay\u201d important? The girls are trapped in the garden.  Only 3 of the princesses have routes for you to pursue with the exception of Finn, the maid. The battle music is interesting. The artwork is pretty.  There are limited places to visit in the visual novel.  Make some tea using several ingredients! If you need help, then don\u2019t hesitate to use a guide! Voice acting is in Chinese. I like Intellia\u2019s voice the most, everyone else was ok. Poor translations make it difficult to enjoy the game, but this one doesn\u2019t seem to fall under that category. There\u2019s possibility for a sequel!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24819418', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24819418' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24819418\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24819418' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24819418\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24819418', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24819418_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24819418_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24754066\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supercoolkid64\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"81612074\">supercoolkid6<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA wonderful story with complex charaters!

I was like &quot;Imma pick two visual novels&quot;. I'm glad Oblivious Garden was one of them.<br><br>I'll make this a short review by saying JUST GET IT.<br>It was worth my time. The 4 routes are all unique and have different and fun experiences in each one, and the overall design and style just felt right. Also, the narration and dialogue? On point. But, as you know me well, I must do a thorough and lengthy review so... Read if you want ^^<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> GO DOWN BELOW FOR PROS AND CONS <\/div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Story <\/div>For a visual novel, story is everything. It has to be immersive and get you to draw opinions about the characters. This VN does just that: it made me feel emotions, as if I was Irell (main protagonist). The story, in short, focuses on Irell, a former-general who killed countless people in a war long ago. Stripped of his status, he is spared life by the Emperor who tells him to go to the Oblivious Garden and train the 7 princesses for the annual Miracle Play. Only 3 princesses have routes, however all 7 are in the game in various ways. Each route explains a different story that all revolves in the same universe, one princess being vastly different than the rest. Since it is a VN, there are also good and bad endings. All the good endings are logical and are not really confusing (minus Dyanna's ending). Overall, it has a simple yet large amount of lore you can derive from it, and I just eat that stuff up! Other than this, the endings all have a trend, usually. It kind of bothers me that it can be done easily, but <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> the emperor gets killed. Is he not guarded well enough or something? lol <\/span><\/span><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Characters <\/div>Characters... VITAL to a VN. Characters HAVE to be likable and serve a purpose. Oblivious Garden does this well. The only complaint I have is that there are a few characters I would've loved to know more about, but sadly did not get the joy of seeing much. However, the main route characters (Dyanna, Lin, Leira and Finn) are each very unique and have rather long routes, Finn's being the shortest. I really like how the dev team made each character have a unique issue with Irell or themselves, and the unique features\/traits that everyone had (I want to explain but it would spoil a lot). But overall, excellent character design and personalities. I loved them!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay\/choices <\/div>VNs don't generally have much gameplay, however this is not a kinetic visual novel: there are choices. The choices in this game are generally challenging as well (especially with Leira), so you have to actually pay attention and try to pick the best thing to do. Choices go from 2 to 4 choices, and are not THAT frequent BUT they are at the beginning and middle of the route. Ending choices get very crucial to your ending status.<br>A unique feature this game has in an in-game mini-game called &quot;Finn's Teatime&quot; where you use your ingredients you have gotten to make new recipes and get the correct amount of everything to make the best tea. It sounds very simple, and it is, but it's also quite fun to get the achievements associated with it. Tea makes a frequent appearance in the routes (as this is a formal atmosphere).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Writing <\/div>The writing in this game, hands down is GORGEOUS. Storytelling at it's finest, ladies and gents. While there are a few flaws (from translation) overall it is very well-written. I didn't notice any sort of plot holes within the writing, and the dialogue for each character was pretty good. Their inner-thoughts and such fit very well with their personalities. The only awkward thing was when the dialogue box switched over to one of the princesses, and it was difficult to tell who was talking until they said &quot;I, Leira, think...&quot;. I knew Irell was not talking, but when multiple princesses were involved, things got a little confusing. But this is no reason to dis the game, and this is only a small flaw that occurs maybe 3 times in the entire game so I would not worry about it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros <\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Excellent character design and personalities.<br><\/li><li> Interesting main character.<br><\/li><li> Depth in general to things.<br><\/li><li> CGs are great.<br><\/li><li> Complex story with a simple outer-shell.<br><\/li><li> Fun mini-game.<br><\/li><li> Good amount of gameplay.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Cons <\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Re-used backgrounds.<br><\/li><li> Not a logical ending sometimes (nit-picking).<br><\/li><li> DLC achievements.<br><\/li><li> Finn's route was a little short.<br><\/li><li> Leira's ending was rushed IMO.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Final Opinion <\/div>If I was to score it, solid 8\/10. There were not that many flaws, and the ones that were weren't huge and contributed to any gameplay. I cannot wait until the sequel comes out, and I will absolutely purchase it!

Thats the first thing coming up to describe this chinese novel. Story is well done and has big replay value because each princess has complex personality and main protagonist is with solid backbone. Genuinely art and music steps up aswell making whole play entirely a pleasure to read and feel just like with good book, and thats really hard to accomplish by any indie VN. <br><br>Coming to playthrough it is relatively easy. And it is first problem with the game  for e.g. We shouldnt know in advance where we meet who during day since it is not explained by plot. Simillar problem appears with voice acting. Our heroines sometimes say more than it is translated in chat box. Thankfully it was rather one time accident from the game and you can be calm about that. For the most part you will catch the drift. Translation is just &quot;good enough&quot; to not cut the essence of the experience.<br><br>What more can I say to sum this up. Well at this point I played quite a lot story based games released on Steam. This VN has something special. It is &quot;maturity&quot; and stable atmosphere which is not easily fading away during the game. Around 8-9 hours is needed to complete 1 of the 4 routes I believe, also there is very fun tea brewing mini game.<br>PS: OST Conflict by Xiaozhi is pure pleasure for any violin fans.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22156591', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22156591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short22156591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22156591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short22156591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22156591', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22156591_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short22156591_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short21954315\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cb007r\/recommended\/323490\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"20184131\">CB007<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 12.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo sum up the situation, this VN is full of lovely artwork and nice music, but has a translation that often veers into the incomprehensible. Some full routes, and some partial routes are perfectly readable, but then you reach sections that seems like they were never reviewed by a native english speaker. Which is really a shame because the character storylines and themes are quite iteresting and fairly atypical for the genre. The story touches on the horrors of war, redemption, on Gods and magic, the lives of these princesses trapped in their beautiful cage. There are a good number of achievements to collect as well. Overall I do still recommend playing, but do not make this your first Visual Novel. And wait until you get a good discount, it's only reasonable thanks to the unfinished nature of the writing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21954315', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21954315' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short21954315\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21954315' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short21954315\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21954315', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short21954315_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short21954315_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/323490\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 362 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["13335082","13696810","14424485","13687584","17276769","13426376","13435021","13374189","17622851","23112534"]}
