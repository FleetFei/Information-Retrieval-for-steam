After a brief tutorial, it turns out the little guy wants to take on Death's Crypts and its perils all alone and here your adventure begins. The story is very straight forward, very effective and is perfectly reminiscent of the best titles of the 80s and 90s. <i>A Wizard's Lizard<\/i> is a fantastic new top-down ARPG dungeon crawling experience which borrows many light elements from the roguelike genre, making it a more than worthy addition to Steam's growing library of rogue-lites.<br><br>While beginning <i>A Wizard's Lizard<\/i> I can see that buried under all of it's simple and elegant charm there is a lot of content to be discovered. The first thing I noticed is that aside from our strong-willed little Lizard mascot, there are 4 more mysteriously blacked out character slots for unlockable types all of varying look and ability. After the short cutscene and tutorial you stumble into the huge halls of a luxurious and massive museum where you learn that the cherished artifacts of this sprawling monument have been stolen by, once again, Death himself. There are at least six different vast rooms in the museum all full of empty podiums for you to fill up with items, enemies and a vast array of other unlockables that you find throughout your journey, just another telling sign of the incredible amount of content and replayability that you will find with this game.<br><br>Your next stop before getting into the chaotic meat of this addictive game is the town which you'll notice at first seems a little empty. You find out that lost in the Cemetery ahead are the people of this once thriving town for you to find who will give different perks such as discounts in shops which are all persistent throughout your plays and once again adds another insane layer of content to this already hefty game. As you find people certain areas of the town will fill out for you to interact with including the Shop and Tavern, creating more and more reason to revisit the starting area as you delve deeper and deeper.<br><br>You have several main abilities to master in your endeavors through the dungeons ahead including your main weapon which is tied to precise right-stick directions, a dash ability, soul Orbs which act as bombs, and Totem Poles which act as defensive towers with different forms for you to find and try. There are loads upon loads of different items and artifacts to find of varying abilities such as the skill to see damage numbers in combat or increased attack power and every single one of them alters your gameplay just enough to change up your playstyle on every consecutive run, keeping you on your toes each time. <br><br>The game is definitely challenging though you are given a second chance with the very cool and unique life\/death system, plunging you into the realm of the dead upon the loss of life and turning you into a ghost for extended play. This isn't as much of a relief as it sounds, however, as you will be joined by the rampaging spirits of foes killed in the past.<br><br>As you get into the core gameplay things happen very quick instantly throwing you into the hectic rooms of the cemetary all of which are procedurally-generated and randomized in classic roguelite fashion, bustling with hordes of enemies and destructible objects scattered all across the enviroment. The action itself is very tight, precise, fast paced twin-stick fare which require quick reflexes and fast thinking with your arsenal of abilities and there is so much going on in a single room it can sometimes get overwhelming. Luckily with the perks you get from various items, upgrades to your abilities such as Totem Poles, persistent bonuses from rescuing townspeople, and discoverable shortcuts the game becomes more manageable, fun, and addictive with every play.<br><br><b>Most will be quick to put this in the same category as other top-down roguelites of recent years, but I'd say <i>A Wizard's Lizard<\/i> sets itself apart by achieving a much closer feeling to the classics it was inspired by than titles such as <i>Binding of Isaac<\/i> by having a much stronger and more realized resemblance to the sound, aesthetics, and gameplay of old favorites akin to <i>Zelda<\/i> or <i>Gauntlet<\/i>. There is no limit to the replayability of <i>A Wizard's Lizard<\/i>, and it is a must-buy as well as a very welcome addition to the world of roguelite dungeon crawlers.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10501089', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10501089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10501089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10501089' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10501089\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10501089', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10501089_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10501089_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t106 of 135 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/recommended\/280040\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">11 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10487468\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"80548570\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/eb\/eb1dd671f873bb98687e3aad9bacdebe07757695.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/eb\/eb1dd671f873bb98687e3aad9bacdebe07757695.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/eb\/eb1dd671f873bb98687e3aad9bacdebe07757695_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/\" data-miniprofile=\"80548570\">Wagglesworth<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/games\/?tab=all\">4,341 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/recommended\/\">31 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/taylort210\/recommended\/280040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 15, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn Indie darling in its own right, Binding of Isaac has had the benefit of an extensive DLC expansion and being developed and produced by the one of the creators of the critically acclaimed Super Meat Boy. To this day, both of these still hold a spot amongst my most favorite games. I\u2019ve put near 40 hours into my Isaac addiction alone, so I\u2019m rather critical when it comes to grading similar titles. With my time with the Wizard\u2019s Lizard, I\u2019ve found an equally addicting affair that takes several lauded features from Isaac and other similar roguelike titles, and modifies and even improves some to craft an occasionally familiar, but wholly enjoyable experience.<br><br><br>First and foremost, WL plays like a twin-stick Isaac; you\u2019re not limited to 4-way firing. You also have a dedicated sprinting function, which you will utilize to get out of sticky situations. Rather than bombs, you have access to a magical immediate-area blast attack and \u201ctotems\u201d which, depending on type, can be laid at any point and can rain all manner of elemental justice on your enemies. These run on a cooldown system, and it quickly shows to be an unwise decision to waste them on weaker enemies. In fact, a major benefit the totems bring to gameplay is an element of strategy that Isaac typically lacks. There are situations where enemies will not be defeated by standard weaponry alone before they can reach you, but with a well-placed totem, a trap can fell a group of nasties before they have the opportunity to sap half your health bar. <br><br>And sap it they will, but then even this becomes a unique part of WL, as death isn\u2019t the end. In fact, it\u2019s often the means to great rewards! Dying once turns your character in a halo wearing ghost, and this brings new implications and dangers. On death, enemies occasionally leave behind spirits of their own, and while in your own ghostly form, they can now hurt you. The risk comes in several dungeon-wide escapades that require the use of living and ghostly forms to pursue, as being ghost lizard allows you access to specific items that only he can reach. While death can bring on even greater challenges with new enemies, it\u2019s entirely possible to earn your life back. Fighting through the ghostly hoard to earn back the privilege of your fleshy exterior is all but imperative, as you will not likely survive the later areas without the crutch of your ghostly half to fall back on should you perish <i>again<\/i>.<br><br> Just like in Isaac, every game you start drops you in a fairly different series of rooms each time, though they start to blend together on repeat playthroughs, as the situational variety tends to dwindle quickly. In lieu of upgrades that give or modify abilities, you find a variety of weapons and equipment, like helmets, gloves, charms and the like. However, (and this is a big issue I have with WL), wearing a spiked helmet, green gloves, demon boots, a diamond ring, several charm necklaces AND carrying an abacus around do not change my appearance in the slightest. One of the most entertaining visual aspects of Isaac was the variety of horrid things you could do to him simply by finding upgrades! The game loses an excellent source of entertainment by not providing similar feedback to the player beyond a menu screen list.<br><br>In keeping up with any upgrades and items you\u2019ve nabbed, the in-game menu screen provides a much needed function that I always wish was in Isaac. You always have access to a larger map and a detailed list of all owned items <i>and<\/i> their abilities. This leads to my favorite feature in Lizard, one that really sets it apart from Isaac in a superb way: progression! Before beginning a run, you\u2019re dropped into a hub, where you have access to a store. While dungeoning, you may run across special shops that will sell you a single blueprint. These blueprints give permanent additions to the hub store, where you can buy and set your starting equipment before each run. To earn money for your equipment, you must seek out missing adventurers in the dungeons and rescue them. Each rescue adds a permanent 500 gold to your starting funds, and a plucky new npc to wander around the hub.<br><br>But far and away my favorite indication of progression comes from the upper door in the hub, which leads to the museum. What could be in a museum, you ask? Well, this museum provides several rooms, each detailing a specific aspect your progression. How many enemies have you killed from a specific dungeon? What weapons have you found? Equipment sorted through? Each found item finds a resting place, along with an apt description of what it is and what it does. The enemy rooms indicate just how many you\u2019ve killed, along with an often cute description and their behavior pattern. It adds an entirely new dynamic to playing the game, and appeals to my want to play just one more in hopes of finding another <i>something<\/i> to add to my collection. The metagame is strong in this one.<br><br>The last item of importance in the hub is the ability to open shortcuts to further dungeon zones a la Spelunky. Opening the first one was a bit of a pain for me, so I\u2019ll enjoy not explaining how I did it.<br><br>There are secrets that are in no way apparent on your first, fifth, or twentieth playthrough, and I won\u2019t give any hints as to the whereabouts of the few I know of. What I will touch on is possibly the most important aspect of this game in relation to Isaac: <b><i>The Difficulty<\/i><\/b>. Typically, the game is standard fare, with your ability to escape dungeons unscathed hinging on your ability to adapt to specific creatures and situations that most often present themselves. That said, there were certainly rare instances of little resistance prior to a specific room, only to be so completely overwhelmed as to die then and there. At the end of each zone you will come across a boss, and this is one of the stronger aspects of WL when compared to Isaac. In Isaac, boss characters may differ on colors, and therefore strength, speed or defense. In WL, bosses <i>behave<\/i> differently, with varying methods of attack, depending on your luck of the draw. I can\u2019t tell you how irritated I was to reach the first boss for the second or third time only for him to whip out an entirely different attack pattern that I hadn\u2019t previously witnessed\u2026 and kill me. I was flabbergasted in the best possible way. That said, boss encounters can be <i>too<\/i> difficult. They have far too much health, and the few attack upgrades you can find barely augment your strength to point where I didn\u2019t even really notice a difference. Expect to spend a lot of time learning patterns and flexing your muscle memory if you want to succeed.<br><br><br>Wizard\u2019s Lizard more than scratches the itch left by Binding of Isaac, and improves and even introduces many features unique to the genre. <b>This game relies heavily on acquired blueprints, making your starting inventory the most important aspect of each playthrough<\/b>. During my play time, I\u2019ve noticed several mechanics and ideas lifted straight from the most popular action rogues, namely Isaac and Spelunky, but this in no way detracted from my time with WL. Rather it insights warm feelings of times gone by with some of my favorite gaming experiences. In the week that I\u2019ve been playing WL, features have been added and notable tweaks were made. I fully expect more content to make its way in for a good while, and what\u2019s here is already arguably more than enough. In short, this game is excellent, and easily sucks away the hours crawling through dungeons just to get a little bit closer to the end, or find that one item or blueprint you\u2019ve been pining after.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10487468', 'summary' );

I've found this game to be somewhat difficult, but the completionist in me just can not accept defeat, and so I keep coming back again and again. At this point I have 50 deaths and 0 wins. Therefore, I'm not at all sure what the ratio is between the game being challenging and my skill level being awful.<br><br>There are a few characters to unlock, however that is far in your future if you're anything like me. First you need to learn the ropes of the game. One of the most enjoyable aspects of a Wizard's Lizard is the opportunity to explore for yourself and get to grips with how to accomplish the objective of the game. However, as you learn a little more each time you die, it has to be said that the biggest drawback to this game is the repetativeness.<br><br>Last of all, I must mention that I have not played The Binding of Isaac, and therefore I can not give you any comments comparing the two games to each other. I find the Binding of Isaac too gory.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>You are a lizard. A very cute lizard that looks cross and sticks his tongue out every time you attack. Your objective is to battle Death and help your wizard. You do this by wandering through the dungeon until you get to the last area. There are three main areas and two side areas. Getting hit (losing health) is a very bad thing because healing items are relatively few and far between. <br><br>As you progress further and further into the dungeon, you'll be able to rescue villagers and buy blueprints which are the two persistent progression aspects to the game. They will give you more options in town before you start a run, making you more powerful, and thus more likely to get further.<br><br>That's about it. It's pretty simple. Kill stuff before it kills you. Don't get hit. Get to the end. Although, as I might have mentioned before, it isn't necessarily easy to do.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Controls<\/div>Controls are WASD to move and arrow keys to attack (you can also use the mouse to attack, but I found it rather cumbersome to use). There are few hotkeys to learn to make life easier, but the three most important ones are: Z is a spell attack, X puts down a totem, and shift makes you dash. It's important to learn to use your abilities to help you clear out rooms faster and with less death.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Storyline<\/div>Very basic. It's really more of a theme than anything else. At the start there is a short cutscene setting you up to go rescue your wizard. Since I haven't managed to win a game yet I can't comment much more than that.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div>I really enjoy the music, it's quite fun if repetitive, but repetitive like Tetris or other beloved old games. You are warned if you hate repetitive music. The sound effects are rather basic and a little jarring on the ears. There are only a few which I deem practical sounds - giving you warning of an incoming attack.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div>Delightful graphics in my opinion. Cartoony, sure, but charming. I also appreciate that I can turn off the bloody globs of zombie exploding because I do not enjoy gore. The lighting effects are very neat, although after a while they became tiresome for me because they do make gameplay harder. There is an option to turn the lighting effects off.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><b>+ <\/b>explore the game for yourself to learn the ropes<br><b>+ <\/b>charming graphics<br><b>+ <\/b>hotkeys<br><b>+ <\/b>a lot to do for completionists<br><b>+ <\/b>achievements*** are more like challenges<br><b>+ <\/b>super cute lizard<br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><b>- <\/b>repetitive<br><b>- <\/b>repetitive<br><b>- <\/b>repetitive<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Help Me Help You<\/div><b>If you did not find this review helpful,<\/b> I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn\u2019t helpful for you.

I'm attempting to review the game as someone without this experience obviously, apologies in advance for where the lines blur.<br><br>DESCRIPTION<br>Wizard's Lizard is a procedurally generated 3\/4 view Gauntlet-like\/Zelda-like. You play a Lizard called Raga but there are unlockable characters. The story is bare bones, someone's gone, go get them and there's stuff getting in your way along the way.<br><br>You earn gold as you go which allows you to buy equipment at the shops, Armour, Buff Items, Weapons and the relatively new Totems (area of effect device with cooldown). There's also a big shop at the start in the town area that you help stock with items by finding blueprints for them the dungeons.<br><br>Your starting gold and starting shop inventory is state, it's saved whenever you quit the game. So as play goes on you get richer and your starting shop is more bountiful. In time using the better equipment will obviously allow you to take a pop at some of the harder looking achievements, speedrunning etc.<br><br>In terms of gameplay you run around a series of procedurally generated rooms that lock when you enter like Zelda, when everything hostile is dead you can leave again. Every weapon in your inventory is thrown at the enemy like in Gauntlet. Almost every enemy is shooting at you as well, it's pretty slow-paced so I'd say don't expect bullet-hell. The room design was constantly (and presumably still is) tweaked so the challenge instead coalesces more from claustrophobic room setups and a blocked off paths here and there rather than constant twitch-style play. Watch out for traps though.<br><br>Where the game takes its own route is the death mechanic, when you die everything goes bright as you enter a kind of purgatory where the souls of most of the monsters you've killed, even in preceding rooms are now after you. The game's parlance is to call it &quot;The Realm of the Dead&quot; (or RoTD). The living monsters that you left behind in the Realm of the Living (let's call it RoTL) however can also still hit you so you're basically increasing your monster count if you're unfortunate enough to die, you've received a second chance but it's slightly harder so it's more of a wake up call if anything. Once you die here you really die this time and it's game over.<br><br>As you might think there are elements of the game that actually require you to be in the RoTD like to pick up a key for a chest or something similar. You can bring yourself back to life by standing on a single-use pentagram, but it really is only single-use and there's not many of them, they cover entire monsterless rooms so you'll spot them when you see it.<br><br>PROS:<br>Out of every procedurally-generated game I've played, this one has the least amount of rooms designed and it shows in the quality of the rooms. There's more than the average brain could handle and that's enough, a lot of other developers could take note from this, less is more.<br><br>Fast startup, after some one-time story dialogue every playthrough is instant.<br><br>Secrets, quite a bit to discover, not just in terms of unlockables but also in aspects of the mechanics.<br><br>The art, very well polished. What you see in the trailer and screenshots is constant throughout no lapse in quality that I can see.<br><br>The boss design, can't go further without spoilers.<br><br>Enemy movement, with each new monster comes a new movement pattern. Variety (and dodging) abounds when two opposing enemy styles meld in the one room as you're backing into a corner.<br><br>CONS:<br>Something has to suffer particularly in a small indie team and undoubtedly in this game it's the sound. The sound effects are pretty low quality and quite a lot of the music is too short and you can hear the point when it loops. Not disastrous though, I've certainly not had to take to turning the sound off or anything. Hopefully the quality will increase with further development.<br><br>Sometimes they tell you, sometimes they don't. There are elements of the game that need explaining just like in Binding of Isaac, except where Binding of Isaac clearly drew a line between when it was a real secret and when it wasn't, in this game it really comes across like sometimes they had the time and sometimes they didn't. Again something I'm sure can change over time.<br><br>Lag. It's made in HTML5 and JavaScript using 2D Canvas, squeezing the kind of performance they already get is very impressive but it beggars the obvious question, why choose these development tools? Rendering with another engine like Pixi or going straight to WebGL would likely melt these problems away in an instant, might not be plausible on existing code base but hopefully 2D Canvas is not the way of Lost Decade's future projects. (BIAS: There is a short term lag issue with mouse right now as well that shouldn't be around for too long, they should be able to squash that one quite quick)<br><br>SUMMARY\/CONCLUSION\/QUESTIONS THAT I MADE UP:<br>Worth \u00a310.99?<br>A lot more, doubtlessly. I paid closer to \u00a325 for early access if I remember right. Worth every penny.<br><br>Blah blah blah blah Binding of Isaac?<br>Binding of Isaac was made by someone widely considered to be one of the best indie game developers currently working , with a number of finished titles already under his belt. He pulled inspiration from as far back as Nethack and peppered the story with elements of his own childhood and worked with a legendary game musician so he could tell a story. If you like me came to Wizard's Lizard because you enjoyed Binding of Isaac then you've found an excellent game but not another Binding of Isaac. Their intentions differ from each other and it shows, yes even in the gameplay. (BIAS: I can actually confirm that regardless of superficial similarities the developers have mentioned several times that this game was not inspired by Binding of Isaac, directly or indirectly. I think it was specifically Zelda 3 they drew from but can't remember)<br><br>What would I like to see in the game?<br>The game is complete as is I feel but I think the Realm of the Dead is far too decoupled from the rest of the game, there are a few opportunities to willingly kill yourself and reap any kind of benefit and they add up to less than a handful of scripted events from the devs, I feel this could do with the most fleshing out. Secondly, achievements, achievements, achievements, there's far too few, this game could do with so much more. I'm assuming they still want to change the game about a bit and they don't want to create an achievement that then becomes obsolete after an update but I hope more achievements follow soon.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoy the game and speedrunning it later in the year will be a lot of fun. The kills really mount up and before you know it you begin to feel a pang of remorse for wiping out 864 owls or imagining the families of the scores of slain Goblins, good Goblins who died in the Amberfall Death Wars to your psychopathic Lizard, their widows traipsing through the desolate Cemetery with their late husbands dual daggers wrapped in cloth saying &quot;...this is all that's left of him. Haven't you done enough!! Can't we challenge death as you have!!&quot;, but you don't hear them, you're knee deep in the remains of some minotaur smashing down lanterns for spare gold. He also recovers health by eating cupcakes!

During your runs you can aquire blueprints which allow you to purchase gear before your next attempt.<br>This system makes dieing less punishing and significantly lowers the frustration level which is typical for this genre.<br>Unlike other RLs AWL grants you a 2nd chance when you die. You can walk around as a ghost, but will face more enemies. If you manage to reach a pentagramm you can also revive yourself! <br>Tip: There are puzzles and secrets which require you to be a ghost!<br><br>This being said, AWL is a very &quot;skill&quot; dependent game. Snowballing into victory by overpowered items won't happen.<br><br>AWL also features an interesting totem system. Totems are stationary buffs, debuffs or &quot;turrets&quot; that can be found during or, with according blueprints, purchased before the run.<br>Giving a player &quot;abilities&quot; is nothing new, but it's relatively new for roguelikes. It's also worth mentioning since it was introduced as direct result of community feedback.<br>Having followed and played the game for 5 month before the initial release, I am happy to see that the Devs not only do their best to fix the usual problems, but also value gameplay suggestions.<br><br><br>I deeply recommand this game, for roguelike-veterans as well as players who are new to the genre.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10471055', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10471055' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10471055\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10471055' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10471055\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10471055', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10471055_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10471055_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10670924\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ryusuta\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"48990700\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a42695e76dd819381b0e0125820ed77229bf5ef.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a42695e76dd819381b0e0125820ed77229bf5ef.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3a\/3a42695e76dd819381b0e0125820ed77229bf5ef_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ryusuta\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48990700\">Ryusuta<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ryusuta\/games\/?tab=all\">108 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ryusuta\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ryusuta\/recommended\/280040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">82.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 22, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t***IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT 2.0.10 BETA VERSION. TO USE THIS VERSION, RIGHT-CLICK THE GAME IN THE LIBRARY, GO TO PROPERTIES, THE BETA TAB, THEN SELECT BETA IN THE PULLDOWN MENU.***<br><br>A Wizard's Lizard is not so much a Roguelike as a &quot;Binding of Isaac-like.&quot; When I first saw gameplay of this game, I was instantly charmed by it. Being a Binding of Isaac fan, I've really wanted something to sink my teeth into while patiently awaiting BoI: Rebirth. <br><br>Right out of the gate, this game has a lot working in its favor - an adorable protagonist, a creative premise (which informs its dual-natured gameplay), a great degree of challenge, a decent soundtrack, and a style and humor all its own, with references to Final Fantasy, Zelda, and even The Wicker Man.<br><br>The challenge is something that comes on strong right from the start, as you are left with very few resources at your disposal to counter the massive hordes of enemies with their sights on you. To counteract this, the game rewards you for multiple playthroughs by allowing you to find blueprints and rescue villagers. If you are able to find an item blueprint, that item will be available for you to purchase back at the beginning hub town. In addition, each villager you rescue will allow you to begin the game with an additional 500 gold. At first I felt this slightly cheapened the experience by taking a random element out of the gameplay, but I quickly found that it allowed for a more customized approach while still keeping the game's random elements intact. In addition, these elements are completely optional, and playing through &quot;naked&quot; is a completely viable tactic to those who are brave and skilled enough.<br><br>There is a great variety of weapon and armor styles in the game, with even the starter weapons ranging from a spear that travels further and more quickly, to double daggers that are weaker against single enemies but are better suited for dealing with larger groups. The weapon variety isn't as vast as that of Binding of Isaac, but it is still early on in the game's life and new content has been added and rebalanced at an incredible rate already.<br><br>The game sports some other options for battling, however. Raga - the titular lizard in A Wizard's Lizard - is capable of two forms of magical attack. The first is a soul-based magical attack, which attacks surrounding enemies, dealing incredible damage. Each usage of this attack will use up a collected soul that you have stored. It can, however, turn the tide of a seemingly hopeless battle in a hurry, making it a spectacular desperation attack.<br><br>The other alternative is Totemic magic. Raga will place a totem on the ground and that totem will attack with a magical effect a number of times before disappearing. The default totem is a little underwhelming, shooting a four-way, low damage fireball. However, there are many totem upgrades you can find, such as one that fires long-range boulders, one that performs its own version of your soul attack, or one that freezes enemies in place, allowing you to attack them or make a quick escape. The advantages to totems are a: the attack comes from them and not you, allowing you to focus on other things, and b: you have unlimited usages of totems, unlike soul-based magic. the disadvantage is that totems have a significantly longer cooldown time, and you might often find yourself sighing in frustration early on as a poorly-placed totem hits nothing, causing you to wait several seconds before you can place another.<br><br>The soul magic also enters into another mechanic of this game - death. In A Wizard's Lizard, if you die once, it is NOT game over. Instead, you become a spirit and now are fighting on another plane, in which formerly harmless ghosts are now substantial and dangerous. The upside to this is that you will find significantly more souls to fuel your magic attacks than in the physical world, and can also find treasures normally not accessible to you. I do feel that this idea could lend itself to more dual-layered gameplay than it does, but it is nevertheless a creative and unique concept for a Roguelike. I have no doubt that as levels and content are added, this will be addressed admirably.<br><br>And ultimately, this one of the strongest points I can recommend this game on. I've been paying very close attention to this title, and the developers at Lost Decade Games have shown an incredible amount of effort and passion in adding to and rebalancing the game. It's a sign of a company that takes gaming seriously and wants to offers the player the most enjoyable experience possible.<br><br>What it really all comes down to is this. If you are a fan of classic-styled adventure games and\/or Binding of Isaac, and you are looking for something new to sink your teeth into, this is definitely your choice. It is an incredibly challenging game with with, style, and charm to spare.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10670924', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10670924' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10670924\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10670924' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10670924\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10670924', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10670924_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10670924_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15920602\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MeleeKirby\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"22066883\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0d\/0d4b205d467c1fa99d8025751cd46e865fac0953.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0d\/0d4b205d467c1fa99d8025751cd46e865fac0953.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/0d\/0d4b205d467c1fa99d8025751cd46e865fac0953_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MeleeKirby\/\" data-miniprofile=\"22066883\">Pear-Shaped Raichu<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MeleeKirby\/games\/?tab=all\">1,607 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MeleeKirby\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MeleeKirby\/recommended\/280040\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">16.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMost people seem to compare this game to Binding of Isaac, and that's a fair comparison. A Wizard's Lizard is a topdown twinstick Rogue-like shooter in which you explore the floors of the different dungeons, gradually earning new equipment, weapons and powers to help you along the way.<br><br>As far as a &quot;clone&quot; of Binding of Isaac goes, this one is actually pretty solid. It feels and plays the part, has great music, and is presented in a graphical aesthetic that feels all it's own.<br><br>One of the game's innovations is the hub village area you start in before you set out for your run attempt. At first, the village is barren and lacking in population. With each run you will occasionally find villagers who have been kidnapped by monsters. Rescue them and they return to the village, each villager rewarding you with a permanent 500 Gold boost for future runs. In each run you will also occasionally find purchasable Blueprints, which when bought will add one random item to the village store for purchase. Eventually, you will earn enough starting Gold to buy some starting equipment that fits your play style, or experiment and try different things. It's a really well thought out idea that encourages replaying and rewards players that stick with it long enough so that they can influence their run's start and not leave upgrades entirely up to luck.<br><br>What really helps distinguish this game from Binding of Isaac is the life\/death mechanic. Traditionally, you'll be playing most of your runs alive, but if you lose all your health, you die, and come back as an afterlife spirit, giving you a second chance. The flipside to this is that there are far more enemies in each room in death, so you have to be even more careful when in this state. If you lose your health while a spirit, you die for good, and it's Game Over. Certain points in the game will allow you to bring yourself back to life, and there are some sections which require you to be either dead or alive to access or pass through, so it's a pretty nice idea to keep things interesting.<br><br>Newcomers to this who play Binding of Isaac frequently with the Xbox 360 controller, a small warning. This game has native controller support, but your shots will be aimed in any direction you point the control stick, not just N\/S\/E\/W. If you're like me, you could be aiming in the slightly incorrect direction due to the placement of your thumb on the controller. With just four directions, there's plenty room for error in Binding of Isaac. Here, you have put in a bit more effort to make sure your shots are going in just the right direction. You'll eventually adapt, it just takes getting used to at first.<br><br>It's no Binding of Isaac, but if you're looking for a cute, gore-free alternative that's pretty enjoyable in it's own right, you could do worse than A Wizard's Lizard. Highly recommended when it's on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15920602', 'summary' );

I had so much high hopes for A Wizard's Lizard...<br><br>And i was not disappointed at all.<br><br>A Roguelike with Rpg elements, that gave me the rush iv been looking for in a game with this style for sometime now.<br><br>You start as a simple lizard that belongs to a wizard (hence the title), and (Wont spoil) stuff happens and you gotta be the hero.<br>And it is not just a Roguelike that throws you in the middle of nowhere and you just keep killing sh*t.<br>no you start at a town and talk to towns people, and go to shops, and unlock stuff, its nice having that in a Roguelike (Lite).<br><br>Controls basically plays like Boi, except for shooting goes at 360* (Degrees) so it is easier to play with a keyboard + mouse for me, i like playing Shooters using a mouse :| it fully supports a controller too so dont worry<br><br>there is an option to Subscribe to beta mode of this game, to get the updates and current fixes and patches.<br>So its great to KNOW that this game's devs are still working on it and improving it.<br>From what i saw so far they are still adding new items and stuff continuously, thats definitely a big plus considering the fact that most promising games gets abandoned, i am glad this game isn't.<br><br>With those ADORABLE graphics, this game pulls off the perfect style for an RPG-Shooter.<br>I just love the first soundtrack, makes me feel like playing a Ps1 Rpg game.<br>very nice level designs, and characters, and enemies, <br>with great animations, the artwork i dare to say is perfect 10\/10 everything is very beautiful.<br><br>The game has a very large set of Items, and Weapons and spells (totems) that can be found or purchased.<br>With the feature of &quot;Spelunky&quot; of finding shopkeepers as you venture through, that you can kill them to get free item ( be careful they are one TOUGH sob's)<br>Unique weapon attacks and styles, different items and &quot;Builds&quot;.<br><br>As for achievements, i can say this game's achievements are pretty tough, the players database of whom finished them is really low, because they are not easy to accomplish, and i am crossing my fingers for trading cards.<br><br>The game has &quot;Inner&quot; achievements or should i say unlockables ( Kill X monsters ) to unlock statues in a gallery you find at the first village.<br><br>Epic Boss battles,Tough Enemies, Treasures all around , Traps , Secrets, everything is there.<br><br><br>So lets go with this again<br><br>Pros - <br><br>- Wonderful graphics, animations , soundtracks.<br>- Huge set of weapons and items and unlockables.<br>- Tricky enemies and boss battles  <br>- High Replay Value, and i think it takes a long time to finish the game.<br>- Addictive gameplay style.<br>- Challenging levels, and great level design.<br>- A mix of Zelda, Binding of isaac, And Spelunky... you cant go wrong with those 3<br>- Different characters, items , weapons (Blueprints) to unlock<br><br>Cons - <br>- I found some minor ones but as they assured me its already fixed in the Beta so its cool<br>EDIT :  They actually fixed many bugs.<br>- Performance issues with large rooms + many enemies.<br><br>i'd definitely dare to say that if you dont buy this game you are missing out on so much fun.<br>Trust me on this one.<br>If you like binding of isaac, and Enjoy roguelikes, or Shooters like this.<br>then this game is your soul mate ^^<br>But don't take my word for it , there are many Youtube videos, thank you for reading ^^\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11869405', 'summary' );
