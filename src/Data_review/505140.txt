They can starve or prosper at your whim, or by your ignorance. That being said, like many modern simulation games it is made in a popular niche of the genre. The most similar, currently popular, game in my opinion that is in this same niche is Rimworld.<br><br>That being said, there are several more established games that it bears similarities to, such as Dwarf Fortress, that I won't put in the same bag because they have been around for a long time and have a huge establishment of fans and supporters who help update it and make it accessible to new players. <br><br>So, going back to Rimworld as the most apt comparison ; <b>It isn't.<\/b> Rimworld had a <u>very, very, very long<\/u> pre-beta\/pre-alpha (Not really because then it would typically be unplayable but that's the common marketing language for &quot;not finished&quot;) phase before it came onto steam, which immediately marks it as unfair competition. It was shown to the public before widespread release, and got feedback before hitting major sellers. So, on the developmental scale it is not a fair comparison. The popular Rimworld that most people know is far past Tribe of Pok, and was by the time most people got it. <br><br>An apt anology would be if someone showed you two tapes of basketball players, but one was from the NBA and the other was from their nephew's middle school. Yes, they're both basketball players. Yes you got them presented to you in similar time. But they were not given to you at the same time in the player's progression, you know that the NBA player had to have had middle school experience, but you didn't see it and you didn't look for it beforehand. <br><br>So now that the development and gameplay comparison is out of the way, compare the graphics between Tribe of Pok and Rimworld ; <b> you can't <\/b> or at least not <i> fairly <\/i>. Games are a largely artistic medium, granted they're an interactive one but they're one regardless. As such you can't hold them in the same standard based on your views. I can't say that red is a bad color because my favorite color is green. The two games did <b>not<\/b> try to have similar graphics, and so they can't be compared. You might like one, you might hate the other, oh well that's subjective. I personally find both charming for different reasons, Rimworld is more sleek, but Tribe of Pok feels more cutesy in its simplicity. This, in my mind, makes me expect more from my colonists in Rimworld and berate them when they fail, but I end up cheering for the tribespeople because they feel simpler. Most people get a feel for the world by the graphics, and if the world looks sophisticated I want sophisticated behavior from the people.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Tribe of Pok by its own merits <\/div><br>I have approximately 4 hours in Tribe of Pok at the time of writing. I didn't delay on the menu or pad my time artificially, this was all in play time. That being said I only JUST finished the base tutorial, I'm right at the diplomacy unlocked point. I could've beelined the tutorial but I spent a lot of time not making shirts and instead building up a larder and digging trenches to collect rain water. <br><br>In these four hours I have not noticed any issues, everything I tried to do I could do without an issue on the game's part. What Tribe of Pok tries to do, in my opinion, it does well. It doesn't try to make you build a giant fort with the expectation that you are willing to lose a hundred times just for the one time you survive your first month in game. It doesn't expect you to build a giant wall and cower inside of it until your stomach growls. It expects you to want to guide a tribe of neolithic people, and be almost directly responsible for the story that unfolds. On that part, it succeeds.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> TL;DR <\/div><br>Tribe of Pok is not like similar games in the genre when compared in context. It simulates a lot of things in a very narrow scope, instead of few things on grand scale. This narrow scope means that the developers have no choice but to notice any glaring bugs and stomp them out before an update, and fine tune minor features later. <br><br>What it does, it does well in my opinion.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25126234', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25126234' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25126234\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25126234' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25126234\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25126234', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25126234_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25126234_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25114190\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052182129\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"91916401\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a5d3d2509302ec5a5835fa4de8b110e31b68115a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a5d3d2509302ec5a5835fa4de8b110e31b68115a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a5d3d2509302ec5a5835fa4de8b110e31b68115a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052182129\/\" data-miniprofile=\"91916401\">Cinderella<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052182129\/games\/?tab=all\">545 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052182129\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198052182129\/recommended\/505140\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is only a first impression.<br><br>Dwarf Fortress Light with heavy micro management.

This isn't done by advancing through ages and research or anything like that, but instead by building up your little settlement. More houses, monuments, vast storage areas filled with goodies, well equipped tribesmen; all are hallmarks of a successful tribe. The more prosperous your tribe, the more people will want to be a part of it, etc.<br><br>The game as it is is fun. If you like management games, you'll be at least somewhat familiar with this, though there's a lot of focus on having a dynamic environment; more so than most anything else out there. Rivers and ground can freeze over in winter, making it not only cold, but harder to get water. Spring rains can flood areas of the map, etc. This affects your settlement in more than just the obvious ways too. If water builds up in your storage areas, things can go bad quickly. Same goes with storing food out in the heat, and so on. While it's not overbearingly harsh, it might may you take a second longer to consider how you'll plan things out.<br><br>Not everything is rosy though. The game is certainly lackluster when it comes to graphics, and the user interface is pretty clunky. Those are honestly the biggest complaints I have for it though, other than no multiplayer. :p<br>The price point seems pretty fair as well. It's a game you could easily sink a few hours into, possibly on a few occasions, but it's not going to consume your life for weeks on end.<br><br>Tribe of Pok is what it is, and it's a pretty decent game if that's what you're expecting out of it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25129194', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25129194' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25129194\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25129194' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25129194\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25129194', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25129194_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25129194_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/505140\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25126234","25114190","25129194"]}
