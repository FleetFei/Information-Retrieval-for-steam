I didn't play it until the Redux version so I probably missed out on some of the rocky features other users complained about, all I see is gold here! <br>      I haven't beaten it yet (so no spoilers please) but I've already enjoyed it enough that I wanted to write this review. I sincerely hope this group of game developers keep at it and expand on this world they've created (I WILL want more Bedlam).  <br>        Does the game have its flaws? Sure, don't they all? But there is so much more to love here than there is to complain about. I love the M\u0153bius style graphics\/art! This game feels strait out of a Heavy Metal Magazine comic, in all the right ways. I'm a big fan of that magazine and, for me, this game stands above a whole host of other contenders for that reason alone: its a glorious tribute\/continuation of that gritty, psychedelic, sci-fi weirdness that defines Heavy Metal magazines from the late 70s. Its also damned fun.<br>        Fun. Creative.

You are not controlling it directly though - you simply set a destination point on the map and hope to get there in one piece (yes, there are random encounters). When you reach it, there are several randomized 'quests' available. Quests usually feature a short gamebook-like fragments, where you decide how to act in certain situations and award you with something - be it meat and gasoline (which are consumed every time you go to another location or send a scout truck on quests), power cells (required to improve your mobile fortress and use special abilities during combat) or new kind of abilities. <br><br>In many cases quests also feature combat. Fighting system in BEDLAM is turn-based, but there is no order of movement among units - you can perform only two actions during your turn, but it's entirely up to you which characters you move or engage in combat. There are four classes of units and each of them has unique features and range of attack. Shotgunners (called trenchers here) have quite a lot of health points and can only attack nearby enemies, but their blast sends the victim one square behind its previous position. Snipers, on the other hand, are very powerful, but their health is low and they can only attack units that are far away. You need to experiment a lot and find the best tactics for each class. Winning an impossible battle with just one unit is not only possible, but extremely satisfying. <br><br>From time to time you get to fight bosses - very powerful creatures often accompanied by several of their servants. If you succeed in such battle, the boss will join you and you will be able to use him in combat like a normal unit - only it's far stronger and resistant! Perfect for end game challenges. <br><br>You can also use special abilities on the battlefield. If you are lucky and explore a lot, your vehicle will even be able to drop nuclear missiles on whole groups of enemies, or teleport your units wherever you want them. You can also use healing, become invisible for a while or confuse your enemies and make them attack each other. Using those skills requires a lot of power cells so you should collect them whenever it is possible.<br><br>Every time your unit kills enough bad guys, it gets promoted and becomes a veteran - it gets stronger and deals more damage, so it is a good idea to have them fight as often as possible. It's very risky though. Healing wounded units takes a lot of time and if they are killed - they are lost forever. You don't have many opportunities to get new party members, so you have to be extremely careful. <br><br>You are not able to load game if your fight doesn't go well - you have to accept the consequences of your choices. And if you lose all units that you have on board or run out of food\/fuel - it's permadeath. Game has great replayability values. It takes around 1-1,5h to complete a scenario on normal. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but be aware that you WILL die a lot and will have to start from scratch, just like in roguelike titles, so you will spend many more hours before you see the good ending for the first time. BEDLAM gets REALLY hard in later stages and can kick your *** even at the beginning if you're unlucky. <br><br>If you like challenging, turn-based games with RPG elements - grabbing BEDLAM is one of the best decisions you can make.<br><br><b>PROS:<\/b><br>+ Combat - simple mechanics, lots of possibilities<br>+ Challenging like a rouge-like<br>+ Great replayability<br>+ Huge map<br>+ Unlockable races that alter the gameplay<br><br><b>CONS:<\/b><br>- No proper tutorial, only a couple of short videos<br>- Depleting reserves of gasoline\/meat prevent you from exploring too much<br><br><b>TL;DR:<\/b> If you like challenging, turn-based games with RPG elements - grabbing BEDLAM is one of the best decisions you can make.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18058894', 'summary' );

Will you manage? It's all up to you. IT might sound easy, but it is nowhere near as easy as you might think.<br><br>SSB is a mixture of the Banner Saga, FTL, Fallout and XCOM with a number of questionable design decisions. I want to make that clear right off the bat. It does a great job of making a post-apocalyptic FTL and and it does a poor job immitating XCOM.<br><br>So, now that we have this out of the way, let's see what the game does well and what poorly. Since my review is a tad outdated, I can tell you this: Version 2.0 made a good amount of changes and fixed a ton of bugs. This tilts my review slightly further towards recomending the game.<br><br>The GOOD:<br><br>1. Great AI. IMO, this is the point that outweighs all others. The AI will do its best to make your life a living hell, and that is something that needs to happen more and more in current games. I really enjoy when the AI actually exploits my mistakes and doesnt simply do a dumb move just to tickle my ego and make me feel like I'm so freaking smart, MLG PRO gamer. NO. The AI will punish you for your mistakes. This is really important to me, and I hope it is for you.<br>2. The artwork is very thematic and beautiful.<br>3. The music fits the post-apocalyptic theme perfectly.<br>4. Making hard decisions is both rewarding and satisfying.<br>5. Exploration is very rewarding and makes you feel good for picking all those exclamation marks.<br>6. Lots of locations to explore and lots of enemies to fight and allies to gain.<br>7. A really good battle system that resembles XCOM. I am pretty sure the devs will fix the stupid flanking (that presently doesnt even work) and will allow the player more flexibility, as it looks the only choice at this juncture.<br>8. A beautiful mixture of four of my favorite games, the Banner Saga, FTL, Fallout New Vegas and XCOM.<br>9. Winning a battle has never been more satisfying - especially against THIS TYPE OF AI.<br>10. Progression is rewarding - it makes you feel good and it makes you realize what you're fighting for.<br>11. Lots of unlockable weapons, variations and vehicles. Some are play-though based and some are not.<br>12. Great replayability. I know for a fact that I will be giving this game a lot of play-time, because I want to beat it and I am not discouraged by failures.<br>13. Great value for the money - the pre-release build was a few euros cheaper, but since I judge my games like 1 euro for 2 hours of play time, I am sure that in order to learn the game, get used to its quirks, learn how the AI works, and beat it will take me absolutely over 40 hours, so it falls into the good category of games in my book.<br>14. Lots of unit races, most of which you even get to play (as in units or heroes).<br>15. Punishing gameplay is not exactly a bad thing. Ironman games are not as bad as they seem. Life, in itself, is an Ironman game. There is no looking back, there is no save LIFE point, that you can go back to. You can't save LIFE at school and replay school if it turned badly. Or Save LIfe at college and replay it if you didn't do well...<br>16. The more you play the game, the better you get at it. Take the time to reel it in and learn from your mistakes. This type of gameplay always grabs me.<br>17. You need to think long an hard before making a move. Just like in chess, you need to consider every piece of the board and what kind of damage may it do to you.<br><br>And now, let's take a look at the bad. Don't be surprised if I repeat some of my &quot;good&quot; points in this section. One man's boon is another man's curse...<br><br>1. Wicked learning curve. You will be spending hours and hours on end as you are getting used to how the units work - both yours and the enemy ones. It took me 2 hours to get past that barrier in order to let the game teach me what bosses do and how units react. And don't get me started on unit range, appearance, race, etc. If you don't have the patience, the game is not for you.<br>2. Great AI. Yep, that's also a bad thing. The AI will 90% of the time go for your weakest unit, or the most damaged one. People like breaking their screens because the AI actually outsmarted them big time. If you have a short fuse, or you are not just moderately patient, the game is not for you. Why? Because unless you think your brains out before making a move, you will get outsmarted a lot. And don't get me started how easy it is to overlook a hidden sniper\/trencher move that might kill a low-health unit...<br>3. The AI punishes you left and right - yep, that's terrible and there is no going past that point. THere is nothing more infuriating to see a single measly unit dodging its way through your mighty 4-tile big heroes in a suicide run just to get a clear shot at your weakest unit on the battlefield...<br>4. Two actions per round - you get only 2 freaking actions across ALL your units. So, if the game permits, you can kill 2 units, which is the best case scenario. Or you can be in a situation where the enemy has a clear pass at 2+ of your units, in which ase you are mightily screwed unless you get creative and use your power cells to your advantage.<br>5. As a consequence from 4, AND TO ME THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST GRIPE - you can lose a mission, and the game, through NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. You can get a terrible spawn, bad flanking shots (even though flanking is a non issue in this game IMO), and lose, and get a GG. Now that, I admit, is infuriating.<br>6. Flanking is a non-issue in this game. I hoped that the devs would fix it. And they did. How? By adding damage reduction. So you could be looking at a fully flanked enemy and they get 50% damage reduction. I sort of helps you but... dont get me started...<br>7. You never know the enemy composition unless you read very carefully - this is another big gripe. You can be faced with a group that would chew your party for fun. Or you can be in a fight that is so easy to win, it is laughable. You never know until you see the battlefield. While that is justified, I find it way too punishing.<br>8. You have only a limited number of soldiers. YEAH. THATS BAD. While you can replenish your lost units with way better or worse soldiers while questing, it may either make or break your gameplay, and once again, though no fault of your own. This is a poor design decision IMO.<br>9. Luck plays a HUGE part of the game. No, I don't mean while shooting, like in xcom. Shooting an ucovered target has 100% chance to hit and most likely kill. To me luck represents the random encounters, the battlefiend positioning and enemy composition and the way the enemy works to whoop your backside.<br>10. So easy to lose, so difficult to win. I believe this is self-explanatory.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>This game *still* gets a cautious recommendation from me. Patch 2.0 did a lot, and made me I like it even more, but I can easily see how tons of gamers will be frustrated by it, especially if they're not used to playing IRONMAN games or they have a short fuse and get easily aggravated when things dont go their way.<br><br>Still, I had great fun with it. I guess I am that masochistic and patient...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18395808', 'summary' );

The main part is naturally the tactical one, where you can send up to four of your soldiers against the different enemies. This fits to the four basic classes &quot;Deadeyes aka Sharpshooters&quot;, &quot;Frontliners aka Meeles&quot;, &quot;Trenchers aka Shotgunners&quot; and finally &quot;Gunslingers using Machine Guns&quot;.<br>They mainly are differentiated via their shooting range\/damage\/health points and mobility. <br>They can also gain experience for kills, which makes them more useful in general. As there is perma-death for your units, you can quite quickly lose an experienced swat though.<br><br>The normal battle takes place on a hexfield with some cover, where you and the enemy can act two times per turn - for your entire squad. This takes some getting used to, but makes it also quite a unique experience in my opinion. On your travels, you can also get some special squad members through choices or battles.<br>There are quite a bit of choices as you visit different locations, which can for example greatly impact your ressources, which are necessary for getting alive through the wastelands. If you run out of fuel for example, the chances are good that your journey ends in peril.<br><br>The story (including profiles for each soldier for example) and soundtrack are atmospheric, while the graphic is fitting, if not quite impressive. <br><br>In the long run the motivation for playing is getting higher results as well as unlocking new kind of &quot;Dozers&quot;, which are the rolling fortresses in which you move. As with the 2.0 update there are Dozers for each of the factions unlockable, with each having faction-like crews with different abilities. They are also improveable, regarding extra functions and weapons, as well the useage of the ressources.<br><br>Conclusio: While Bedlam can have quite unfair moments (especially some of those random events) it offers enough variation and battle possibilities to enjoy quite some playthroughs. Some may have their quarrels with the battle system (which is questionable, even after the last update), but if you get used to it, it can be quite entertaining too, as well as with the balancing.<br>So... Bedlam surely isn\u00b4t for everyone, although i like it.<br><br>Point Scale: 7\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18939308', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18939308' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18939308\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18939308' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18939308\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18939308', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18939308_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18939308_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21904632\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e0\/e096bf4df8d3c48b5be5346d2a02962c1c97c5e5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/\" data-miniprofile=\"33395706\">Hobbes<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/games\/?tab=all\">3,566 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/\">95 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thatfuzzytiger\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Skyshine, after a long time in the making, finally deliver upon the promise of Bedlam, two very distinct games in one most excellent package (and one elephant that sits in the corner).<\/div><br>It's been an awfully long journey. The initial rollout of BEDLAM was to lukewarm reviews and to muted user response, largely because of a very polarising core mechanic which encouraged some very specific and exploitative play (the long and the short was that it encouraged some very specific team configurations and relied too heavily on you getting an elite that you could power through the game with). <br><br>That version of BEDLAM remains, for those that enjoy that style of game, however, there's a new mode, called &quot;Campaign&quot;, and with that comes a completely new BEDLAM, one based very much on the XCOM:EU 2 AP per character approach. This completely flips the game on its' head, encouraging a balanced team of rotated characters where each individual link in the chain needs to be as strong as the next, lest you start leaking team members due to people getting smooshed by elites in the late game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">This all sounds well and good, but what IS Bedlam to begin with?<\/div><br>Skyshines' BEDLAM is a blend of a few different games - FTL and The Banner Saga probably being the most prominent titles that would make the most sense to suggest, having a flat overworld map made up of nodes that you can explore, a lot of which have choice based text adventures, along with a smattering of isometric tile based combat encounters where you move your combat pawns around and fight against your opponents. In this game losses are permanent, so there's a touch of the rougelite about it as well, along with persistent meta-progression as you complete runs and unlock more dozers and more options to start your loadout with.<br><br>The theme and lore of the world is absolutely excellent, seriously, it is. A bone dry wasteland that is filled with some memorable characters, a lot of backstory to each one, and a pulpy, comic book feel to the whole thing. The world building has been very well thought out, and is consistent enough that it could easily be built upon in other games, the lore is strong enough to serve as a platform for books and stories, if the game is able to keep going. The art style equally has this pulpy comic style that serves extremely well, and helps set the tone for the game in general, you really do get immersed in this somewhat askew look at the apocalypse. It's more Borderlands than Mad Max, and that's entirely to its' benefit.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Getting around in yer Dozer<\/div><br>Mechanically, the game plays out somewhat similar regardless of Arcade or Campaign mode. You'll be moving from node to node on the overworld map, and then exploring minor nodes with your outrunner car as you see fit, sometimes this will result in a fight, sometimes this will result in an adventure encounter. Either way, there's a LOT of content to digest, it's easily on a part with FTL post it's advanced edition patch, if not moreso. You'll be working your way through the badlands of Bedlam fighting the various factions, each have their own little quirk which adds flavour to the combat, as well as figuring out the best build for your playstyle (since each of the classes have their own way of fighting, and mixing them gives you a very different approach depending on what setup you run with).<br><br>With the advent of the Campaign mode, there's now two very viable choices for players. Arcade mode satisfies those who enjoyed BEDLAM at the point of release, complete with the BLITZ-o-meter and the original 2AP per side regardless of how those AP were spent over the turn. The Campaign mode satisfies the tactical thinkers who prefer the XCOM:EU style of approach with AP on a per character basis, and means that encounters are far more about teamwork and thinking ahead in a group sense, rather than an individual sense. These two very seperate modes actually work to the benefit of the game, opening it up to a much wider audience, and giving the game life where previously it would have been restricted only to very specific fans of the lore or the style of game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">You mentioned an elephant?<\/div><br>I did. This game suffers from Kickstarter-itis. Almost as badly as Armello did. I therefore have to slap the warning that any retail purchaser of this game will be purchasing a game that no matter what will never be entirely content complete. Some elements of the game are going to be kickstarter walled off, there's a thunderdome style encounter that is not yet implemented that is going to be KS only, along with a Unique Faction Dozer (this is believed to be the Banner Saga Crossover one, or that might be another one on top) that is intended to be KS only. <br><br>Whilst this may make up only a small-ish percentage in &quot;absolute&quot; terms, it nonetheless renders the product <b>content incomplete<\/b> and therefore I will openly state that the game is such. If at some point in the future the developers open the option for people to buy (note, buy, I'm not asking they GIVE us this, but the option to pay for it) then I will change my review accordingly.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Closing thoughts<\/div><br>It's been a long road. But Bedlam is now a game I can, with the above caveat concerning content, now fully recommend. It's good, it's actually solidly good, and therefore worth getting, though with the content issue I would still advise holding out for a sale of some sort because on principle you shouldn't pay full price if you're not getting access or the ability to get access to the full game. That's my personal stance, and you may choose to go for it regardless.<br><br>Final Verdict : <b>Highly Recommended, caveat - CONTENT INCOMPLETE DUE TO KICKSTARTER LUNACY<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21904632', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21904632' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21904632\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21904632' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21904632\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21904632', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21904632_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21904632_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26914089\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"74050109\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9115a975bf3b4fee9f3692795af057c4c528617a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9115a975bf3b4fee9f3692795af057c4c528617a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/9115a975bf3b4fee9f3692795af057c4c528617a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74050109\">peremptor<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/games\/?tab=all\">4,387 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/recommended\/\">390 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/peremptor\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEqual parts Mad Max and FTL mixed with old school grid\/turn based combat, Bedlam is a game that is as punishing and harsh as the environment it represents but nonetheless provides a worthy challenge if you're a fan of the rogueishlike genre that is all the rage nowadays for indy devs.<br><br>I've only played it on normal and well...

It is not easy, and it is made that way. It is punishing, brutal and difficult. It will chew you up and spit you out a thousand times over, and I like it for that. If you have read the reviews you will see a lot of complaints about the combat and that is what I would like to address for the most part in this review, becuase beyond that the game is entirely amazing.<br><br>COMBAT: Essentially BEDLAM is a game that takes a lot of inspirations from games like FTL, Banner Saga and XCOM. First and foremost, those who are comparing this combat to XCOM obviously haven't played Banner Saga, or they would see the clear translation to this game. Don't treat the combat in this like XCOM. If you do, you will die. The combat in BEDLAM needs to be treated more like a game of Chess. You need to find synergy between your units, and utilize them according to their strengths. For example, synergizing your trenchers and their knock back ability is essential for maintaining control of the map and positioning enemies where you want. Enemy just out of the range of your deadeye? Push him into range with a trencher and synergize your units. Play to your opponents weaknesses. Does your enemy have 3 deadeyes? Close the gap and play close. Get in their face and play smart so they can't make a play without getting punished. The combat is difficult and brutal, you WILL lose units, it is made this way for a reason. My only major complaint that I can't justify is the Blitz-o-meter. In my opinion the blitz function is what makes the combat over the top difficult. It basically takes the game from an 8\/10 on the difficulty scale to a 9.5\/10. If the enemy is going to get a blitz, I should too, or no one should get one at all. Also, unit placement. There is no unit placement prior to engagements and that is a major no-no considering how vital positioning is in this game. The positioning of your units its CRUCIAL, especially given the fact that if your unit is &quot;in the open&quot; and not utilizing cover, it is a 100% hit. I think if Skyshine implemented a pre-combat positioning system, this would solve A TON of peoples complaints about this games combat. <br>EVERYTHING ELSE: The other meaty chunk of this game is the overworld map and dozer management. All of which I find awesome. It is very FTLesque and definetly feels like I am struggling over those same risk\/reward issues that FTL would slam in your face, and it is great. The music it atmospheric and sets the scene, the voice acting is gritty and fitting, the artstyle is attractive and the animations are nice and provide some gruesome deaths. The Dozer upgrades are cool and can provide some help in combat, although you will often time not have the resources necessary to use them because you are either...<br><br>1) using the in-combat heal function too much because of the unforgiving combat<br>2) trying to upgrade your crude effeciency, because good God crude is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and a half.<br><br>What is boils down to. Skyshine. Listen and implement a pre-positioning system for combat. I think this will drastically improve the combat as is because it is beyond frustrating to be hot dropped into a combat scenario against a group of enemies and your 3 deadeyes are right up front, meaning you have to take a very very very very valuable turn to move them back, knowing 1 of those 3 are probably going to die because of the 2 action limitation.<br><br>I recommend this game for those who are seeking a challenge and who ARE NOT looking for XCOM combat.<br><br>WARNING: THIS GAMES COMBAT IS NOT LIKE XCOM AT ALL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR XCOMS COMBAT YOU WILL BE VERY VERY UPSET.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18071816', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18071816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18071816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18071816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18071816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18071816', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18071816_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18071816_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18846286\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007107921\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46842193\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b49ed3193b695f1834ded29df1d42e1942057e93.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b49ed3193b695f1834ded29df1d42e1942057e93.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b4\/b49ed3193b695f1834ded29df1d42e1942057e93_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007107921\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46842193\">Kolbas<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007107921\/games\/?tab=all\">239 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007107921\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007107921\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">109.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 2, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a great little game! Great atmosphere, music, style and very enjoyable. Many negative reviews are the early version of the game, which was unfairly hard. At the current state, it is NOT very challenging on normal difficulty, once you understand the mechanics, which are pretty simple. Here are few simple tips to get you going:<br>1.\tUpgrade your dozer asap<br>2.\tDon\u2019t spend energy on equalizers, at least until\/if you get some really good ones. In most cases it is better to use the default dozer weapon. Only use the weapon if there is no other option and you risk losing your lvled crew member (obviously, don't ever risk loosing your lvled chars)<br>3.\tSniper is the strongest char by far. By mid game my main sniper delivers 20-25dmg, which is enough to end even a boss fight.<br>4.\tIt is essential to level up your crew: give kills to the same crew member. Your main crew must be able to 1-shot your enemy to avoid taking damage: you will need 10dmg to kill any regular enemy. This is easiest with snipers, as they dish out 10dmg at lvl4. <br>5.\tOnce your main team is leveled up to 10+dmg, start leveling up some backups. To allow injured crew time to heal<br>6.\tPosition your team right on the edge your enemy\u2019s firing range + their move range. This way the enemy can\u2019t move and shoot at you in the same turn. Eventually they will decide to move into your firing range and you will reposition and 1-shot them<br>7.\tIf enemy BLITZ is inevitable \u2013 use the dozer weapon to get them drunk. This is a great opportunity to level up your crew and\/or get pickups.<br>8.\tMelee chars are also great, especially once you level them up to 10dmg. Since they have good health and range \u2013 you can easily get pickups and don\u2019t worry too much about being hit. Also they are the best to avoid BLITZ (if you can\u2019t use your dozer weapon) \u2013 because you can simply charge in and not die<br>9.\tIf you still have trouble with difficulty \u2013 check out game wiki and youtube<br><br>GLHF!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18846286', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18846286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18846286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18846286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18846286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18846286', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18846286_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18846286_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t55 of 78 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18089393\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970500076\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"10234348\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1475be3dde180ceb277b1fdf02f594d401998f0a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1475be3dde180ceb277b1fdf02f594d401998f0a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1475be3dde180ceb277b1fdf02f594d401998f0a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970500076\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10234348\">spitty<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970500076\/games\/?tab=all\">154 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970500076\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197970500076\/recommended\/367600\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">41.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBedlam is a great rogue-like game with amazing art and atmosphere.

I'm Quirky.<\/div><b>Skyshine's BEDLAM is a slick tactical game in a rich post apocalyptic setting, but its punishing difficulty curve and bugs make it difficult to recommend.<\/b><br><br>The turn-based tactical combat and the comic book art style had me looking forward to this title for a while and I was happy to jump into Skyshine's post-apocalyptic world.  I've never played any rogue-likes before by I'm no stranger to permadeath and I don't tend to shy away from difficult games so I thought this would immediately be a good fit for me.  I was wrong.<br><br>The tactical combat has a great design.  It was fun to play around with the four unique units and learn their abilities and how they synergize to best plan ways to take out my foes.  While the combat isn't necessarily deep, the units and battle map allow for good flexibility in how to approach different skirmishes earning the combat design a fair comparison to chess.  The characters are animated very fluidly and the death animations in particular are satisfying without being excessively gory.<br><br>The initial battles are simple enough to help the player learn how combat works, but the difficulty soon scales up with the player frequently being outnumbered by units that are more powerful than the player's units.  This will cost the lives of precious combatants making future battles that much harder however, this difficulty can be offset by the area-of-effect Dozer Weapons and the Equalizer buffs that can be found as the world map is explored.  Even so, I found myself rage quitting and restarting more than once due to a particularly bad run of luck on the battlefield.<br><br>I've encountered a few bugs but none of them game breaking.  I lost more than a few good men in combat when my turn was ended prematurely, but this bug seems to be related to the use of specific Equalizers so it's easy enough to work around.  On a few other occasions, the game froze during battle but the menu was responsive so I was able to quit the game and restart the combat.  On a couple other occasions I had quit the game after a particularly difficult encounter only to return to the game hours later in a saved state that was prior to me engaging the encounter.  Even after completing the encounter again and advancing to the next encounter in an attempt to force the game to update and save my progress, I had to replay the encounter again because my progress wasn't recorded correctly.  I understand the spirit of rogue-likes is to accept consequences and not save scum, but in the absence of a manual save option bugs like these should be ironed out.  These bugs are frustrating, but the patient player can overcome them.<br><br>Outside of combat and bugs, Skysine's BEDLAM is a demanding resource management game.  The world map requires crude (fuel) to traverse and meat (food) to feed the inhabitants of your Dozer.  Additionally, Power Cells can be collected and spent to upgrade your Dozer's efficiency as well as aid you in combat with area-of-effect attacks.  The Equalizer buffs that are also used in combat and consume either crude or meat.  In this way more fuel, food, and power can be sacrificed to spare your combatants, the other vital resource of the game.  Figuring out how to strike this balance will help you traverse the world of BEDLAM, which includes many points of interest.  In order to gain entry to the location of the final boss, you'll need to collect relics that are highlighted on the map.  Other points of interest include resource pick-ups as well as Elite Units to fight and have join your dozer.  The numerous unmarked locations on the map that you'll visit can result in a skirmish, gaining resources, finding rogue combatants to join your Dozer, power-ups for your Dozer, or nothing at all.  There is a good variety of different events and outcomes such that the player never knows what to expect and also has to balance the possibility of gaining much needed resources versus getting into a fight while his experienced units are recovering from the last battle.<br><br>It took me about 8 hours to figure out how to succeed at the game and another 8 hours to actually complete one run through of the campaign.  Those first 8 hours were frustrating and at times even discouraging, but having made it to the end, I'm satisfied with the experience and look forward to starting another campaign to see if the early game is any easier after the experience of my first game or if it is just as punishing as I remember.  If you're patient, I recommend Skyshine's BEDLAM.  If not and you have high expectations in general, you may not enjoy this one.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27892108', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27892108' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short27892108\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27892108' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short27892108\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27892108', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27892108_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27892108_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/367600\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 684 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30378458","18058894","18395808","26073887","18939308","21904632","26914089","18071816","18846286","18089393"]}
