Improves on it, then changes the game into more of  a traditional 4X experience, with turn based game play.<br><br>The Good: <br>Ship design - This is very deep with a level of subtlety and customization which no other game seems to have, at least in terms of whats on your ships and how they behave in combat.<br><br>Personallity - The races all have distinct ship models and very distinct personallities. There is a bit of cheesy humour in the game and allot of pop culture referencing which is worth a laugh. *spoiler* I got to weld guns to a t-rex's head and then use it to eat people!!!*<br><br>AI - After about 8 hours I have come to appreciate the difficulty of the AI, they wait till your fleets are out of position and attack core worlds, will try and undermine you diplomatically and have varied personallities ranging from homicidal to just the nicest little plant people ever. They also seem to adapt to your ship building strategies and it seems very difficult to cheese the AI in this game.<br><br>Empire Management - This is HARD and requires allot of thought. Managing some worlds to be food producing worlds and others to be ship producers or science worlds is an interesting balance and sometimes having more population on your homeworld is not the best choice. This means that a variety of adaptive stratagies are required, absed on your surroundings. This adds allot of replayabillity as games can vary wildly.<br><br>Fleet Combat - very pretty, plenty of strategy and a bit of point and click. Not one of those games where i want to autoresolve every battle.<br><br>The Bad<br><br>Ground combat - Can still be fun but is not quite up to the standard or polish that the rest of the game seems to have. There is however a suprising degree of strategy in what looks at first to be a very simple minigame. Especially when you take the variability of some of the races into account. I freaked out when i realized the squid men could squirt ink into peoples eyes......<br><br>Some balance on certain weapons - Overall ship modules are well balanced with few weapons ever truly becoming obsolete which is AWESOME. However there are some modules (Im looking at you plasma cannons) which could really use a buff.<br><br>The Ugly:<br><br>Haters - There are ALLOT of haters after some of the issues with SD1. Personally I can see where they are coming from but i easily got my 30 bucks worth outa the game. BUT i swear i am sick to death of the illiterate streams of untruthfull vitriol that get posted about this series. This is the onlly reason i wrote this review. I am a busy person, but i got so sick of all the polarized BS i felt i had to write something.<br><br>To Sum-up: Stardrive 2 is a difficult game with a steep learining curve that has deep and rewarding systems. Its not for the feebleminded. Some of the production values in certain areas of the game are a little low but otherwise it feels like a AAA game. I would heartily reccomend this game to any lover of 4x or grand strategy games and to anyone as obsessive as i am about building the deadliest ship ever.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15299568', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15299568' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15299568\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15299568' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15299568\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15299568', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15299568_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15299568_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t124 of 167 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15323477\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"71079066\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/12\/1278238315887638049abcb0802769b83b449961_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/\" data-miniprofile=\"71079066\">Icemania<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/games\/?tab=all\">28 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198031344794\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">407.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 12, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Updated to consolidate thoughts after all the time played so far<\/b><br><br>If you are interested in a military 4X game with a heavy focus on extermination then Stardrive 2 is recommended.  However, if you want to play a more peaceful or diplomatic game then I would not recommend it as it\u2019s really not possible to play that way at the moment.  <br><br><b>The Good<\/b><br>There are various early game opponents and some events with nods to sci-fi fans.  <br><br>The AI is strong early game and I had to reload during my first game a few times to improve my strategy before winning on Normal difficulty.  <br><br>The technology tree really does feel like Master of Orion 2 and I enjoyed mulling over the options.  <br><br>The Battle Arena has been good fun to test designs and weapons and the combat is generally a highlight.<br><br>I've encountered no major bugs and while there were some minor bugs, there was nothing gamebreaking.  <br><br>In some ways it is an improved game over Stardrive 1 but there is plenty of room for improvement.  <br><br><b>The Bad<\/b><br>The technologies and weapons need to be better balanced.  Once you've tested them in the Battle Arena it becomes apparent some are worthless.<br><br>The late game is really tedious.  Colony governors are needed particularly for the mid to late game as it becomes micro intensive.  There are no defaults for troop loadouts so you have to do every one manually.  Late game AI ship designs are very weak so the battles become trivial and nowhere near as much fun as the early game.<br><br>The ground combat is weak.  Automatic resolution comes at a high price as it leads to excessive losses compared to manual combat even when you have a massive advantage, so it essentially forces the lame ground combat or bombardment to avoid it.<br><br>The AI\u2019s are far too aggressive in responding to expansion.  The AI's are very similar and it's difficult to avoid anything other than Total War.  The tolerance mechanic used in diplomacy is good but needs to be increased as currently diplomacy is a bit of a side show.  <br><br>Brutal difficulty is not hard enough once you get familiar.  In fact once you learn the mechanics this is the easiest 4X game I can remember.<br><br><b>The Lowdown<\/b><br>I had a lot of fun with the early game and Battle Arena.  As a result of the time I've played the game, I'll stick with a recommend, but without more serious improvements I don't see myself wanting to load the game up again (and I tend to play genuinely good 4X games much longer than this).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15323477', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15323477' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15323477\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15323477' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15323477\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15323477', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15323477_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15323477_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t167 of 234 people (71%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">15 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>65 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15551269\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"13733247\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72d511d892287362087fcc5c607e71133739a82b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72d511d892287362087fcc5c607e71133739a82b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/72\/72d511d892287362087fcc5c607e71133739a82b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/\" data-miniprofile=\"13733247\">the1sean<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/games\/?tab=all\">114 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/recommended\/\">8 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197973998975\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">58.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 25, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI made a race of photosynthetic treehugging cybernetic (trans)humans, killed space eels, found an eerie asteroid, experimented on my own citizens to create a zombie plague from said asteroid, lost Earth to a space wolves sneak attack through a wormhole while my main fleet was capturing my robotic enemy's homeworld. Then I turned the space wolves core systems into a zombie infested plague quarantine zone and retook Earth with space eel-cannon-armed-battleships produced by my new robot servants. After that the samurai space bears started a border war with me and things got interesting.<br><br>10\/10 would terrorize the galaxy again with zombie plague fleet mounting space-eel-cannons.<br><br><br>Seriously though, this is a good game. Great? No. Good? Yes. Bugs? Yes, but they are consistently being stomped and progress is happening quickly.<br>A little bit about me, I have played probably every major space 4X game made. MoO1-3, Space Empires 2-5, Galactic Civilizations 1-2, Sword of the Stars 1-2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Imperium Galactica 2, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, and many many more. I also was a Beta Tester for a couple of the Distant Worlds expansions and you can see my name in the credits. So you could say that I have been around the space 4X block, and I really enjoy this game, warts and all. Let me break it down a little. Keep in mind the next few things throughout my review:<br><br>A - this game is made by one developer (goes by the handle &quot;Zero&quot;), and he contracts out art, music, and other assets. So very indie. <br>B - this game is only $20+ at time of review, and as an owner of StarDrive1 I got a discount (so no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing about having to pay for a new game if you bought SD1, and yes this game is a huge leap forward and worth the price). What's my point? This game is arguably as interesting as Civ Beyond Earth, and a fraction of the price, so lots of value for the money.<br>C - I am comparing this game to other space 4X games in each category, not other genres.<br>D - I have read some reviews where players claim that the AI is cheating, I think they just didn't RTFM and don't realize that there are mechanics like TAXATION that can net players and AI lots of cash to supports massive fleets and cash negative planets with.<br><br><br>Graphics 9\/10 - This isn't Halo4, but man this game LOOKS GOOD for a space 4X! Great colors and effects, and the ships and artwork are clean and stylish. Explosions and weapon effects are slick. IMHO best looking space 4X in a while. The only weak point is the ground combat doesn't look very good. Would have preferred the ground combat from MoO2, even now the most epic looking space 4X ground combat.<br><br>Sound 8\/10 - This game has an epic sound track that I didn't tire of easily. Weapon effects like different thuds as mass drivers hit armor or shields brings the combat to life. Quite adequate.<br><br>Diplomatic AI 7\/10 - This game has a great feature where there is a threshold on how many deals you can make with another faction that keeps you from spamming tech trades or going from being complete strangers in to becoming instant besties like in the Master of Orion series and most 4X games. The main drawback here is that the other empires just don't feel as alive as they could, but to be honest this is a huge problem with most 4X games. The main one that does it better is GalCiv2, man that AI was dastardly! I will note that as of yesterday (4\/24\/15) Zero released a patch that works on my of the Diplo AI's issues so this is definitely something that will get better with time.<br><br>Strategic Fleet AI 8\/10 - Your opponents don't quite feel as alive as they could, but man are they AGGRESSIVE, and I am not just talking about declaring war. This is the first space 4X in a long time where the AI contantly pounces on my undefended systems (and INVADES the planets successfully) and aggressively engages my fleets. Enemy fleets could coordinate a little better, and upgrade their ships more often, but overall the Strategic Fleet AI is solid. <br><br>Ship Customization 9\/10 - Dude this game is seriously cool, like Gratuitous Space Battles mixed with Master of Orion. Love the ship customization, the only drawback here is that SOMETIMES the AI doesnt pick great ships to build. The other minor gripe is that not every race's ships are created equally, some races have more spaces on their ships for components, etc.<br><br>Map 9\/10 - Two of the four &quot;X&quot;s are Explore and Exploit, well this game has fun mechanics that really support this. Meaningful wormholes with interesting placement, space monsters, pirates (human themed space monsters), Orion... I mean Master raiders are there and there are rewards to be gained once they are defeated. Also, planets can have specials like having deep caves, dangerous fauna, strategic resources that give your empire a boost, etc. In addition there are minor races that you can trade with, hire mercs from, or attack and subjugate.<br><br>Ground Combat 6\/10 - This feature just isn't there yet. It has the potential to be very advance wars or XCOM, but instead it is just kinda underdeveloped and a bit of a slog. I would suggest Auto-Battling until this is fixed in a patch or in a Mod, which is sure to happen and would be pretty easy to flesh out.<br><br>Tech Tree 9\/10 - This is very closely based on the Master of Orion model, including the core concept that you can only research one of three techs at each level of research and can only trade or steal for the ones that you didn't research. This is assuming that someone researched a tech, and often one tech isn't researched and so you can have a game where some techs aren't available. There are a few nice features that earn this high score. One, you can often unlock secret research projects by doing things like killing a space monster and dragging it's corpse in for research. Two, each race has hidden techs specific to it.  Three, at the end of each tech tree are a choice of two advances that you can take over and over again that give you meaningful benefits like increased ship speed, weapon damage, diplomacy boosts, shield strength, etc. There are also references to one of my favorite scifi book series &quot;Old Man's War&quot;, so kudos to the dev.<br><br>End Game 8\/10 - Currently there is no allied victory condition, but Zero posted as of the latest patch that he will be adding that in. No victory animation or movie (like the slick one in Master of Orion 2), or Civ style map replay (which would be really cool to relive the adventure), nor a power graph screen, but it does rank you versus fictional SciFi chracters (I was ranked Picard); funny I dont recall seeing Kirk or Blackjack Geary listed, what a shame.<br><br>Modding Support 8\/10 - As of right now the game has Steam Workshop but it isn't listed like normal, you have to navigate to the Workshop tab and search plug-ins to see them. Alternatively you can head over to the game's forums on the dev's website. StarDrive1 benefitted heavily from player made content and I suspect that this game will too. Unfortunately at time of review there is no integrated mod loading menu like in SD1, not sure of dev plans but I hope this is added sooner than later and that the Steam Workshop works correctly soon.<br><br>Stability and Bugs 8\/10 - Small bugs, but no crashes, and not too surprising considering that the game is so indie but looks and feels so high budget. Some people report framerate issues, but I have experienced none. I have an i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM, Nvidia card. Make sure to keep your drivers up to date!<br><br>There is more here than I have listed, like a really in-depth medal and experience system where your ships can level up and earn medals through various combat exploits, which give them relevant bonuses (ie: Purple Heart, if your ship survives after being reduced to 35% health, whenever that happens in the future it takes 10% less damage). There are fun missions, and funny alien empire dialogues, overall this game is really great for around $20 at time of release.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15551269', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15551269' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15551269\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15551269' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15551269\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15551269', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15551269_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15551269_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t103 of 137 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15330504\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"89755940\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b00192c840896394a9716d42290371fa46ea6cc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b00192c840896394a9716d42290371fa46ea6cc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3b\/3b00192c840896394a9716d42290371fa46ea6cc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/\" data-miniprofile=\"89755940\">TonkRogerio<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/games\/?tab=all\">864 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/TonkRogerio\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">70.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 12, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of the best 4x games to come out in a long time. SD2 has phenomenal game design philosophy...in Most parts.<br><br>THE GOOD<br><br>Ship design:- This is by far the best ship building feature off of any 4x game excluding the original which manages to outdo this one just ever so slightly. You manage everything within your ship in a FUN way. This is the problem with a lot of other 4x games with ship building, they add a ton of things you can do, but it doesn't feel fun. You're just moving numbers about. In SD&quot;, you get to see exactly where your components go, why they go there is completely up to your combat logic. You want to create massive artillery ships with weak armour and then create some up close and personal heavy shielded and armoured heavy hitters to protect the artillery? Easy. Then when you've built your ship with a specific class in mind, you get to see how it plays out in battle. <br><br>Combat:- Superb combat. The action takes place as an RTS. You get to build your fleet in factories after you're done designing it, then put them together in a fleet. When that fleet meets an enemy fleet, you enter into an RTS strategy map where you can plan out your manoeuvres in real time or with a pause function. There is some UI issues which I'll go over in &quot;THE BAD&quot; section. My only other complaint besides the UI is that there really isn't anything to interact with in these battles. An asteroid battle or having to battle over your home planet, trying to make choices of attacking the ships that can kill your ships, or attacking the bombers that can kill your population would make an excellent addition to the ship combat. As it stands it's awesome, but with a few wasted oportunities.<br><br>Events:- Another thing that SD2 outclasses everything else on. Events make you feel like you're really managing your empire. In most 4x games you see something on the map, get the reward and off you go to the next one. In SD2, you can find things that intertwine within other concepts of the game. For example, you can find a world where dinosaurs live in. So you now get a new research project to mount guns on the dinosaurs... There are quests you can find, the usual $50 from every other 4x game, and events that  happen because of your own doing. Create too much pollution on a farm world and your crops are dust for a few turns. Build a ship production line on a lava planet and you might just find a new way to make hulls more durable using that planet's natural resources. Events make the universe come alive and it follows choices and consequences in a logical and believable way for the player.<br><br>Tech:- At first I was disappointed with the tech tree. I've been let down so many times in 4x games before, that when I saw videos of it pre-release, I just thought there wasn't enough there. Well I was wrong. The choices you make in tech are really meaningful. You have to pick one tech out of a couple of choices and you never get to pick the other tech again. You can trade for it with other empires, or steal it from them using spies, or taking over their planets with a specific trait or tech. This makes trading for tech pretty important. But even though you never research all the techs, there are so many that you will be researching for days. You also get new techs that come up due to events in the game. Found a strange asteroid? Tow it back to earth for a new research project. Colonized a planet with a specific negative attribute? New tech (My only complaint is that these don't exist for every planet with negative attributes). Found a wormhole next to a research planet? New tech. You get the point. I really hope that this feature gets expanded on in a future update though.<br><br>THE BAD<br><br>UI:- There needs to be a more user friendly interface. It does a lot of stuff right, like showing information most of the time for example, but in combat, it fails miserably. Why can't you highlight all of your ships and have their powers show up at the bottom so you can click on all of them instead of each one individually? Same with troops. Why do I have to waste time loading combat with my scout, just to wait for him to retreat? Why can't you drag all of your ships and place them in a different location before the battle starts (or even save a formation for your fleet?!?!??) Why can't you click on an enemy troop with your troop selected for an automatic attack with your main weapon? Why can't your melee troops auto run and then attack when you click on an enemy soldier with your troop selected? Things like this are just not acceptable in this age of gaming. An almost catastrophic oversight in SD2.<br><br>Ground Combat:- This is not fun. It's OK, but it's not fun. Most of the problems come from the UI. So once that's fixed, we can begin to enjoy the simplistic nature of this minigame. Maybe an expansion should really concentrate on adding more to this mechanic.<br><br>AI:- the AI cheats. We all know this. The problem is that they don't play by your rules. I hate this sort of mechanic in games. I like the AI to play by my rules, not for them to get bonuses while we get gameplay mechanics. It's much harder to balance a game this way and I feel like this was a bad but maybe forced decision by the developer.<br><br>Generation Options:- There just isn't enough options for generating your galaxy right now. No slowing down tech or production options, only 100 planets, not being able to add custom races to go over the 8 AI limit. A missed opportunity here.<br><br>PERSONAL STATEMENT ON DIFFICULTY<br><br>I don't really feel like the game is too hard right now. I play it on hard as the humans and I'm doing pretty well. I feel like deployable shields are OP in ground combat. It's got to a point that I just don't lose soldiers anymore. My under tech'd ships are doing their job just fine because they have shields and a good formation with strong artillery, and the enemy doesn't do that. They get some missile throwers but it's just not enough when I have big massive cannons that start attacking them before they're even in range. I really don't see why everyone is making a big deal about the difficulty. Start off with building as many small ships as your empire can handle for free, then defend with them (for medals) until you get shields. Build 2 artillery ships with little armour, and 3 frontline armoured ships. All 5 ships with shields. That's enough to defend against any attack through most of the early game (safe till at least 2 fifths of the way through). I know the humans get some pretty powerful ship traits, maybe this is why I'm not finding it difficult.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT<br><br>This game is awesome. I've not been able to put it down since it came out. I know it was made mostly by just one man, but I'm not paying to appreciate the awesome talents of one man creating an awesome game, I'm paying to play an awesome game. And I can't say I'm displeased with that. I got a nice discount for owning the first game, but I would still recommend it even if it is full price. Just know that there are parts of the game that will feel unfinished. Specially the UI. As it stands, it never really prevents the fun parts from being fun. It's still a masterpiece, a slightly flawed one though. 8.5\/10<br><br>MESSAGE TO ZERO (Maker of SD1+2)<br><br>Make DLC for this game. I waited a long time for SD1 DLC. Don't disapoint us, we all want to throw our money at you for DLC.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15330504', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15330504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15330504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15330504' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15330504\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15330504', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15330504_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15330504_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t164 of 273 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">9 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>13 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15280072\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"35414881\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f9e6f99985f0cfd6b34acb29eec014c9b6c64f7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f9e6f99985f0cfd6b34acb29eec014c9b6c64f7.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2f\/2f9e6f99985f0cfd6b34acb29eec014c9b6c64f7_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/\" data-miniprofile=\"35414881\">echo2361<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/games\/?tab=all\">96 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995680609\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">79.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 9, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFull disclosure: I am a Stardrive 2 closed beta tester, but I have not received any compensation for my testing or for this review. I'm really just a 4x gaming fan at heart who was lucky enough to be given access to Stardrive 2 during its development :)<br><br>I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a galactic empire building game featuring that &quot;just one more turn&quot; itch that some of the great 4x games of the past have offered. This is definitely a game that can keep you up late at night, constantly clicking end turn just to see what lies ahead in the development and struggles of the star nation you've spent hours carefully building.<br><br>Right from the start, you'll be faced with interesting events, encounters, and anomalies that will drive you to spread your chosen species farther out amongst the stars. You'll research interesting technologies, some of them unique to your species and others totally random in nature. You'll find valuable resources to claim through colonization and exploration. You'll design and build your own starships to conquer your enemies and protect all you've gained. You'll engage in diplomacy and espionage with\/against a variety of interesting and unique alien species all with their own agendas. You'll meet minor species to either befriend, enslave, or exterminate.<br><br>The combination of turn-based empire management with real-time space combat helps to break up the pace of the game into enjoyable yet distinct pieces. Being able to see a newly researched weapon help your ships blaze a path of destruction across an enemy fleet in real-time combat helps to tie the entire game together and makes it feel like every decision you've made matters. The ship designing and customization are definitely high points of Stardrive 2. The space combat is visually impressive and always fun to play. The ground combat is turn-based, with an X-Com Enemy Unknown feel to it, which I've come to really enjoy as an entirely separate mini-game within Stardrive 2.<br><br>In short, if you're looking to escape from reality for hours at a time by putting on the hat of a space emperor and building your very own interstellar civilization this is the game for you!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15280072', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15280072' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15280072\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15280072' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15280072\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15280072', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15280072_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15280072_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t75 of 120 people (63%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15313075\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019903369\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"59637641\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8d\/8d14675a7b76bf509762261d361ad6b7d100002f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019903369\/\" data-miniprofile=\"59637641\">Xelanthol<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019903369\/games\/?tab=all\">190 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019903369\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019903369\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">38.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t     I see quite a few negative reviews on here talking about the difficulty of the game, so I'll share my point of view on that. So far I've played a number of games over 11 hours (normal) and have lost every single one. You know what though? I get a little bit better every time, and I know I'm getting close to winning. The first time I conquer the galaxy I will feel like I earned it. The AI doesn't cheat, it's not entirely ruthless towards you as long as you dont take the repulsive trait because you want the easy 4 points.<br><br><b> People get upset because they lose. The fun is in the challenge of rising to the top. I think it's quite fitting that the first few times you try to conquer the galaxy you get slapped around. <\/b><br><br>     It's a game that takes practice, turn it on to easy if you are struggling and make sure you understand the mechanics of the game.  There is a tutorial which lots of people ignore and several help sections in the game. Some mechanics are a little obscure, for example how your empire generates galactic credits beyond population is not explained very well.  However, there is an insane amount of tooltips explaining anything you mouse over which makes it really easy to find information. <br><br>Combat is really fun, though the fact that the default ships are designed incredibly efficiently probably contributes to the difficulty new players are having.  However you can easily see the default layouts (which again are quite good) and can work on designing your ship from there. There are a few performance issues with large scale battles, but I hope to see them ironed out in the future. There are a large variety of weapons and options for those weapons, as well as support systems so you can design ships any way you like them. It also looks pretty damn good too. I hope to see more activatable abilities in the future, but right now space combat is a solid tactical experience.<br><br>The economy is good. It's really irritating that people are complaining about the map size, because I can't imagine playing on something like a 150 system map. There would be too much to do. I think a few people loaded the game and said &quot;what, 70 stars default?&quot; without understanding the depth of the economy. You'll be really busy managing your empire with even a few systems. You can specialize your planets and they also develop over time, gaining unique traits depending on what you do with them. High research planets attract universities, big farming planets will eventually attract a farmers market, etc.<br><br>There is more I could go on about but overall I'm happy with my purchase. I'm excited to see a few balance passes over the next few weaks, but other then that it is already a solid experience.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15313075', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15313075' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15313075\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15313075' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15313075\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15313075', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15313075_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15313075_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t75 of 121 people (62%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">13 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15288652\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"2069714\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8be9f420ee6409bd59ab0fad3092ae99b2ac2737.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8be9f420ee6409bd59ab0fad3092ae99b2ac2737.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8b\/8be9f420ee6409bd59ab0fad3092ae99b2ac2737_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/\" data-miniprofile=\"2069714\">Propain<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/games\/?tab=all\">549 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197962335442\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just finished watching a live stream of the dev playing the game and learned a lot from it. I still have my reservations about the game, however Zero is patching the game to address some of the concerns I've had about difficulty. <br><br>Truth is if you play the game 'smart', you can win. Having said that, I tend to turtle. I like games with a slow burn to them. I don't like getting into wars very early. Maybe that's where my frustration comes from. I would still like to be able to refine AI behaviors much more and tune them to my preferences and hopefully we'll see the implementation of that. <br><br>Regardless, Zero seems to really care about the game and the community. I believe he'll do everything he can to make it fun for everyone. Those that want an easier game, will probably get it, and those that want the challenge, definitely already have it. <br><br>Bottom line is, the game is worth it. I don't want to turn anyone away from this with an overly negative review. My original review had nothing good to say about the game and that's very very wrong, the game is worth the price tag and definitely worth your time. <br><br>Previously published negative review:<br>There are a great many things to like about StarDrive 2 but unfortunately the incredibly unfair and difficult AI outshine anything good this game currently has to offer. <br><br>The main problem comes from the fact that the AI seem to be able to 'cheat'. They always have these impossibly massive fleets that more than out match yours regardless of how advanced your race is. Diplomacy is laughable. It's always completely one sided, the AI will make you an offer but will almost always reject your counter offer even though it's more than a fair trade. If you refuse to trade with them on account of you getting a terrible deal out of it, be prepared for them to invade you almost immediately. <br><br>The problem is two-fold because the difficulty setting does NOTHING for the AI difficulty. The only thing it does is change how hard diplomacy is. Because of this the difficulty setting might as well not even be there. Even if you are able to get a race on your good side, and you give them everything they ask for and more, they will inevitably declare war on you for seemingly no reason and they will always win that war because they're somehow able to match your forces 3 - 1 or more.<br><br>This is not even taking into account the amount of 'random' enemies that spawn very early into the game and destroy any progress you make. They never stop. You can't destroy their bases because you aren't given enough time inbetween each attack to amass a fleet large enough to destroy them. The worst is when your main fleet is blown to bits and they go after your freighters. You can't defend your freighters because an enemy engagement with them is an automatic combat failure. They're just destroyed. So your colonies starve and die out. If you create more, the AI that's camping your home world will just immediately destroy it. You can't send reinforcements because the game forces you into a combat screen with no way to send more ships to help.<br><br>This is a huge problem because your fleet could be RIGHT NEXT to your home world but the attacking fleet manages to get in just right so the only thing fighting on your side is the orbital station around your world. So you just have to let them destroy it while you sit there unable to do anything about it. <br><br>The combat 'fun factor' suffers for me because if they decide to attack my lone scout vessel two feet away from my main fleet, I have no choice but to waste a good 30 seconds entering combat and making it retreat when it would be so much better if I could just have my main fleet join the battle.<br><br>In short, the current state of this game is frustrating.

The problems with ground battles start from randomising the troops instead of allowing for 1 standartised troop type you want to take into battle wiht you; \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing up your carefull planning of team at some point * i honestly dont know  when * by randomising what they carry in battle despite meticulous repicking of what they have. But that doesnt matter, the enemy AI is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 poor. All you have to do is sit at starting point and accumulate points, then ai rushes in with nothing and you get what is 2 turns of firepower unleashed on them before they have a chance to respond,... then just mop it up.<br><br>Ive seen a lot of people complain about how the game is hard and ai might even be cheating. Truth is AI is horrible in macro map aswell and it does indeed cheat at least somewhat. For this was made an experiment ( you can confirm this yourself btw ) -&gt; create TINY map with extremely limited resoures and max ai. Reload till you have good starting place, since rest of galaxy sucks \u2665\u2665\u2665 AI will be attracted to what your system has to offer and might 'scout' it with colony ship. Thats right! Its 'very lucky' with guessing where good planets might be. Incredible feat. Same goes for assuming firepower. AI knows what you have at all stages without scouting anything. If it saw you on map and met you you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing bet it knows what you have. <br><br>Does it matter that it knows? No it does not. AI has no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing clue what is going on macro wise and all it cares about is Command points and total ship count. Suppose you have 4 stationed tier 5 ships outfitted to the maximum of capability, just imagine 2500-3k worth of manufacturing. Thats about 8 CP if you play your cards right. And just 4 ships. In AI&quot;s mind you have NOTHING AT ALL. ITS A FREE WIN TOWN BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOO! TIME TO PILLAGE. And then they get destroyed. It wont stop them. No sir! They will keep spamming the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 little ships untill their last planet dies. It refuses to adapt it refuses to utilise the technology they have. Hell i GAVE them tech for tier 4 and 5, gave them schematics for weapons and armor for free to what my diplomacy allowed. Gave them 100 turns and went to war with them. 200 turns later they still dont have anything bigger then tier3 ships with swarmers. Ai \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing loves swarming.<br><br>And its  the ultimate cancer, you see in late game you will be facing say 200 CP (command point) fleet. Are you excited for some epic showdown of 2 mighty fleets? You better not be because you will be autoresolving the battle. If not prepare for 1 fps for next 15 minutes because ai will be carrying as many corvettes it can, and the t3 ships will be filled up with viper fighters spamming up everything. Do you have NASA supercomputer? Well too bad for you the game doesnt give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you will still be lagging. <br><br>AI never changes tactics in any form or shape. Ive also never seen pirates spawn and attack AI how it does happen against player. then again maybe my scouts and listening posts are not all seeing so i might have missed it. <br><br>Lets focus on the positive -&gt; the diplomacy window for reactions is great! Its charismatic, filled with love, changes accoarding to what is going on, its hilarious and enjoyable. You know whats not enjoyable? The limiting system. I want to sell 21k woth system to someone too bad best fdeal i can get is 9k for it as a single tech from my semi ally thanks to all the limitations. <br><br>Ai having different traits at start is great and makes the game extra fun, but as a general rule of thumb i found that the only 2 races one can trust are Dreylocks and Bears. Everyone else will be all too happy to backstab you despite all agreements and previus actios. <br><br>The Values of things need to be adjusted aswell. Once again  - i have  the power to destory\/slaver everyone then sacrifice whomever i dont like, entire galaxy teaming up cant stop it *mostly because they refuse to build good ships no matter what*. <br><br>Ship symmetry\/design is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed big time for ships tier 5 as of right now. Its not a design choice, its a design \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up, - there are tiles missing, extra tiles making no sense, entire rows missing even though the face of the vessels are symmetric. Upon pointing that out, our valiant developer replied &quot;I have a feeling that you may have an obsessive co'. Charming.  No word on fixing either. I mean i can guess that there was just not much time to probably test t5 ships  and few problems were missed  but...really? How hard is it to measure. Sloppy, lazy, insulting.<br><br>Might i remind you that original StarDrive was pretty much abandoned in favor of pursuing more cash from creating 2d one? No multiplayer yet. It would have been possibly the redeeming part of the game, but its unfortunately not here. At least as of right now. <br><br>What else was great: the charming world, elephant wizards, great Ghost Pirate Tigre, Zapp Brannigan etc, fun dragons, - those are all welcome additions, but what the game is really good is - these tiny details, like good diplomacy gimmicks, charming lore, those kind of things. What is game bad at? Everything else. Mostly AI. Its been a while since ive seen one so bad. Watching t5 beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of everythign enemy has to offer is like watching a professional boxer beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of a handicapped old man. Its disgusting and not fun.  Its bad strategically and tactically, all it does is spamms small ships even if its doing nothing for it. Thats the AI's plan to win. Enemy can destroy everything you have and not bat an eye? Wont agree to peace and give 2 technologies instead of 1. <br><br>Overall its a fun game. Its NOT GOOD. Not yet at least. A LOT of things need to be rebalanced and tweaked and fixed before this game is good. If developer doesnt start fixing this and instead moves on to moving StarDrive 3 i humbly ask you to not support him. If, however the developer starts getting work dont, then by all means buy the game and enjoy it.<br><br>As it is right now i give it 5\/10. No multiplayer and about one of the worst AI's ive seen as of late. In 2010 maybe that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 would have slided, not today. Has potential to be 7\/10, not more.

I was initially put off that I could not research all available technologies, but later, I realized why this choice is a good one. 1. It forces you to choose your tech to match your strategy. 2. Encourages diplomacy with other races to trade technologies. 3. Adds replayability. <br>    <\/li><li> Good AI. SD2 can be very challenging. If you're new to the game, I'd recommend the &quot;easy&quot; difficulty setting.<br>    <\/li><li> Beautiful space battles, planets, and galactic map.<br>    <\/li><li> Managing your galactic empire is a lot of fun. Making sure your making money, making sure happiness is high, exploring the galaxy for the next place to colonize, are all great.<br>    <\/li><li> Ship design and space battles. Your victory in space battles is far from guaranteed. In large part it depends on how you build out your ships. Even then, there are some enemies that you will encounter where retreat is definitely the correct choice.<br>    <\/li><li> There is some light hearted humor in the game, which I appreciate.<br>    <\/li><li> Has a good tutorial system. The tutorial covers what is needed without overloading you with detail and stopping you from playing the game. Getting started with StarDrive 2 has been a much better experience than I've had with other games of this genre.<\/li><\/ul><br>Cons:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li> Loading screen takes a while.<br>    <\/li><li> Ground combat was not as refined as I would like it to be. I realize a game can not be all things perfectly. Look at Spore for example. Comparing SD2 turn based combat to a game like XCOM would not be fair either. I've had fun with the ground combat, but at times, it can feel a bit tedious. The thing to remember is that ground combat is a relatively minor component of this game, and is not the primary emphasis.<\/li><\/ul><br>The biggest feature that I appreciate about SD2 is that it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. I didn't play enough SD1, since I don't play on Windows as much as I used to, to adequately compare SD2 to SD1. That said, StarDrive 2 is a good game. <br><br>I had a chance to play the closed beta and was not paid. Naturally there were bugs during the beta, but Zero quickly addressed all the bugs I found. <br><br>If you're a fan of 4x games, as I am, you'll not want to miss StarDrive 2. <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15282030', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15282030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15282030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15282030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15282030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15282030', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15282030_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15282030_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30741007\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198069837825\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"109572097\">jaysonjota<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 59.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 hrs and just cant stop playing it.

It is my first, so I'd be glad for productive criticism!<br><br>I don't really get why, but this game is <b>severly<\/b> underrated due to people who seemingly aren't capable of handling the not-always-obvious complexity of the game.<br><br>First of all, I would like to adress a few things mentioned in other reviews:<br>- I have read reviews about massive, &quot;unbeatable&quot; AI star fleets needing the &quot;impossible&quot; amount of 200 Command points. I have 4 Fleets needing 40 CP each, and calculating the combat CP of one of them, I am at 252 due to frigates and corvettes. That is as much as I have to say to this manner.<br><br>- There are bugs, especially considering random fodder appearing near fleets, fleets which disappear (the fodder will still be there), and so on. I even managed to get into a &quot;resolve ground combat&quot; loop which forced me to alt-F4 out of the game. However, there is no real game breaker so far, as the game saves each turn and before each combat. Most of them are of cosmetic nature. A few (like reappearing dialogue options which unlock the very same science projects) are quite hilarious, but everyone with some kind of memory should be able to handle it.<br><br>- And here goes my personal favorite:<br>&quot;<br>Spam colony ships.<br>Take over 2\/3s of the galaxy.<br>Get your 3 super-powerful fleets wiped from the face of said galaxy by blatantly broken &quot;balance&quot; mechanics for the AI.<br>Uninstall.<br>&quot;<br>Nothing to add. Dude, you are at the wrong kind of game. Simply take a look at the huge penelaties over-sized empires ;) (Expanding to fast? You lack all the rest.)<br><br><br>So here comes my pro\/con, despite the ones already handled:<br><br>PRO<br>- You can design your own ships, allowing you to create own tactics - do you want specialised ships working together? Do you want an all-rounder? Choose yourself!<br>- Intense depth of gameplay and unbelievable complexity. You play your first 3 campaigns and you are pretty much assured to get the hell blown out of you. Trieing the 4th time, you hopefully know about the fleet mechanics, the economic difficulties and tweaks and the leaders fitting your playstyle. And you will still be beaten, until you mastered the balance between all 4X aspects and rule the galaxy. This is something many 4X games lack in my opinion. And sth that should not be missing at all!<br>- Punishment for unbalanced approaches, if kept over long time. Not like having a massive fleet improves your planetary infrastructure, you know?^^<br><br>CON<br>- Missing move command for simply rotating a ship in tactical combat? I have tried it for a full of 1min before winning the battle anyway. So far, an attack order is needed, with the target in engagement range, to let the ship rotate onto the target without gaining directional speed. MEH.<br>- Missing rotation in fleet deployment<br>- Missing multiplayer entirely. Although it is turn-based (except space-combat and events).<br>- Bugs. Even if most of them are cosmetical, and no real game-breaker is present, some of them require you to load the latest autosave (which doesn't loose you much, as in any progress at all) or force you to kill the process, may it be with alt-F4 or via the task manager.<br>- Neutral, hostile fleets are simply overpowered in early game. My first playthrough got eXterminated - by the Masters. My second? By the masters. Howling wolves stormed my apartment at the third, so that one is not due to neutrals. Oh wait, my military forces vanquished against them just 2 turns to eXtermination. Who cares. I managed to handle them quite well on later playthroughs, though.<br>- Spy-o-mania. That is completely up to everyone himself to decide, but I simply dislike the massive spam of spies getting in my empire. And later in the game, the whole events-bar gets spammed with killed, &quot;enemy&quot; spies.<br>- Missing possibility to form alliances. This is a major con as it's simply stripping a major part of gameplay and strategic planning.<br>- Enemy factions limited to a number of eight, as remaining peoples to choose from. Why a con? Because tree.<br><br><br>All in all I can recommend this title to all hardcore 4X-fans who can oversee cosmetical bugs and got nothing against reloading a savegame every once in a while (as in &quot;every 2-3 hours of gameplay&quot; (I may have been lucky)). But I do mean &quot;hardcore 4X-fans&quot; who got nothing against loosing quite a few times before being able to do anything real, and who intend to get into the complexity of the game before expecting accomplishments. If you are more of the casual player who just wants to game on - well, move on. You will be terribly punished by this game as well as any 4X title worth of his genre.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30139894', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30139894' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30139894\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30139894' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30139894\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30139894', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30139894_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30139894_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30066809\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Armazati\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"240661665\">(AYPRP Owner) BoundCNapalm L<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 156.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDear Haters of this game<br><br>My experience with this game were awesome, You cant even imagine what kind of things you can do with this if you put your mind to it, Most of you arent actively planning out what your going to do, But when you do, It is entirely awesome when your plan comes together like a giant sandwich, You haters havent put your mind into this game, Thats why you lost, I suggest that you actually put your mind to this game, Maybe you will win, Technology and Logistics are key in this game, You want to know the way into a enemy base before you send a large fleet in, Sure the enemy may have around 50 or several times larger CP, But you might have the technological advantage, You could devestate your enemy from orbit with nukes after your Titans have successfully destroyed a Starfortress, Or you could conquer them on the ground, Trust me, I have lost many more times then i can count, But i kept going, You should too, I know many strategies that work out in many ways, Against a enemy with High Technology and low numbers? Overwhelm them with High Technology and Overwhelming numbers. Against a swarm of enemies with limited tech? Lure them to a distant sector of where you can battle them with support from a Starfortress. Against a enemy with High Technology and Numbers? Outwit them, This game is awesome, If anything, You should be learning how to play this properly, Lazy snakes.<br><br>BoundCNapalm Lucharias signing out, Goodbye for now.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30066809', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30066809' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30066809\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30066809' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30066809\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30066809', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30066809_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30066809_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29892703\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971261410\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"10995682\">AegisFire<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 103.0 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThumbs up with the understanding this game comes with bugs but otherwise is a fantastic endeavor at a moo2 recreation.  (discounted purchase recommended)<br><br>This game does a better job over any other game of its type at reminding me of Masters of Orion 2... in many ways its a more beautiful version of MOO2.  Very apt as another reviewer wrote Moo2.1.  But I am ok with that, as a matter of fact more than ok.  This game was as the professional reviewers put it, &quot;compulsively intricate&quot; and &quot;the best thing since moo2&quot; and if thats the case would have to say it deserves a Thumbs up despite its flaws because so many games nowadays release riddled with bugs and get great reviews.  Honestly, there should be a grade between 1-10 not just a thumbs up or down on these reviews, but I whole heartedly believe this game despite everything falls on the good side not the bad side, and deserving enough of a thumbs up.<br><br>I'd give it an 8\/10, if it weren't for the few game breaking bugs. But it's just so much fun when it's working right that I think it's still worth a 6+ but would recommend you buy it at a discount.  Some areas lacking polish like some additional informational text on a tech or two would have been nice.  But overall I am very happy with the product bugs notwithstanding and am sad to say that there may not even be another attempt at Stardrive 3 considering all the negative publicity it has recently gotten.<br><br>My opinion is that most of the people that had gripes about the gameply or function of this or that just didn't understand the gameply mechanics fully.  I read the reviews before I played the game and tried to keep an eye out for everything they said and just couldn't find many faults with it.  One might say they attempt to steal your tech too often, almost every turn actually, but thats why you build and maintain defenseive spies... and honestly its one of the best ways to get ahead and would not put it past a player to try to steal tech every round if it were possible for themselves.  It usually comes down to enemy tries this, but you counter with this, if you don't counter, you suffer.  I don't think the game should be rediculed on many of the points it lists when there is a perfectly viable and available way to counter the issue built into the game. I also didn't run into any issue where I couldn't overpower the computer if i chose to invest in military might or any other catagory. <br><br>As for command points, the maximum per colony is not 4, its 6 for the largest battle station, 1 for a command antenna and there are some other bonuses and techs to add more and you can even put bridges and cockpits to your ships to reduce the command point cost of them, in addition to this you can add 7+ points per colony, more colonies more points.  So if you have 50 cp you can use 50 cp worth of ships reduced by the bridge and cockpit modules if you choose to install them.  And all of that is on TOP of the multitude of free ships it lets you have.  For instance if you hvae 50 CP you might be able to have something like 30 corvettes and 15 frigates without even using one of those CP, then you can make a cruiser with a bridge reducing its cost by 1 and that would mean you could still make 25 cruisers before you ran outta command points. And that doesn't stop you, you can make more, it doesn't mean you have to stop, it just costs you money for maintenance after you pass your CP thresshold.  I feel like CP depicts the amount of ships you can control within your logistics capacity -  its simply a way to give you free ships... it by no means stops you from pumping out as many ships as your empire can support with money.  And this of course is not a new concept, many games use this in the strategy genre.  <br><br>The game could use a few extra diplomacy options, and they do fall straight away to hatred if you expand too much, especially the races that have the trait expansionist, like hurt little kids if you take their candy... but I feel that just falls within their race trait and act accordingly.  I otherwise never had any issues with diplomacy and used it often with no issues.<br><br>The ship construction and design isn't found in any other game of this type to the degree that has been implemented and I thouroughly enjoyed that aspect of the game.<br><br>There are a few intereface changes I would make, but there are changes I always think should have been added in every game.  For instance, I would have loved to have 2 arrow buttons to slide between colonies onteh build menu, not just he planet menu, it would have saved a click or two.<br><br>Bottom line, I thoroughly enjoyed the game for the first 40 hours and intend to put at least 100 hours into this game.  I feel that its worth the 30 dollars but if your not sure youo can handle the extra bugs that are in fact within this game and you are very interested in what you see, well then take the dive when its on sale.  If your open minded and understand that nothing on this earth is perfect and you liked moo2 and its faults then you should really like this game too.<br><br>Thank you for reading.<br><br>EDIT:  So, after a whole lot more hours into the game I have noticed a few bugs pop up that could potentially ruin the game.  Strangely the first round I didn't use the DLC ships and didn't have any of these problems.  But after using them I noticed the following problems in my second playthrough... one of them potentially catastrophic in that it can destroy your game progress.<br><br>1) a graphical glitch on the strategy map fleet icon that wont go away with your fleet containing the DLC ships<br>2) planet could get stuck in invasion mode and you cannot recover your soldiers (or hereos) leaving you with no chioce but to bomb it into a glass ball... however, i believe your still paying for the upkeep of these soldiers.<br>3) after a battle the fleet upkeep will go from -800 to -8900000 for no aparent reason and the CP cap will be higher immediately after the battle, when it corrects itself your so far in the hole with  your currency that you cannot support your empire which could cause all your assets to be sold off.<br>4) selecting fleets with HUGE number of ships can cause frame rate to drop to very low numbers until you deselect it.<br><br>On a side note, your likely to enjoy the game in a small or tiny galaxy as it prevents the battles from getting onboxiously huge and making your graphics card **** itself inside out in battle simulation (no issue with auto battle) ... in addition to making the choices you make with ship building more impactful.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29892703', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29892703' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29892703\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29892703' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29892703\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29892703', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29892703_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29892703_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29573787\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198199857603\/recommended\/252450\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"239591875\">bantly_robert<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 144.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 29\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe closest thing to the Master of Orion series, including humor. Strategy side is good except for AI opponents going to zero tolerance when you get too big - makes diplomacy more or less impossible unless you are losing. Well, maybe realistic but not fun. I enjoy the strategy and ship design, don't much care for the race-specific hulls or RTS combat. I find the overall strategy pretty engrossing and can kill a day at it pretty quickly. This game does NOT feel like CIV to me - the tech tree makes you give up good stuff to get stuff (real decisions), and NO STARLANES! Hooray. If you want a civ-type game, get the new Master of Orion or GALCIV III.<br><br>All it is missing is Turn Based Combat and multiplayer.<br><br>On the hulls, you &quot;can&quot; make the Ralyehans good, just skip to the cruiser and use generic corvette and frigate hulls. When you get BB, there is plenty of room in the hull for a stand-off mass driver, missile, or anti-matter torpedo attack. You just have to make nice in the beginning and wait for the decent hulls.
