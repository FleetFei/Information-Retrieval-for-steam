Controls are very easy and you only need your mouse. Yes you read it correctly, you don't need keyboard to play it, mouse is everything you need. Game is very simple as you draw springs to jump with left mouse button and shoots small fireballs to destroy blocking squares. In all levels there are various photos in background with title from same country or smaller scale location. Game contains 4 seasons at this moment with 5th coming out soon. Each season have 20 levels with first one very short introduction of new obstacles. In each season  levels gradually increases in size and gets bigger and bigger. Every level has it's own theme based on country or other location.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> PROS <\/div><br><b> Soundtrack. <\/b> First good thing that comes to my mind about Sketch! Run! is soundtrack. Every level has it's own soundtrack handpicked for level theme. Sometimes it doesn't hit the mark but most of the time it is really fitting and nice.<br><br><b> Gameplay. <\/b>. It was hard to decide whether gameplay is good or not but after few minutes debating with myself i can say that it is good. On first play 2h went really fast and i enjoyed despite few minor things. Gameplay itself is very casual and relaxing. At first i was frustrated of how hard to place springs correctly but my suggestion for you would be spam springs. If you need to do few jumps upwards just spam your springs and it will be easy.<br><br><b> Educational value. <\/b> Leave a kid playing this game and you know that he won't see any brutality or cruelty and he will see some pictures about different countries. Play by yourself and you will see some beautiful places from other countries.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> NEUTRAL <\/div><br><b> Graphics. <\/b> I can't justify graphics for this game. Everything is simple and nice. It doesn't feel that game is lacking something in graphics but at the same time there is nothing achieving or impressive.<br><br><b> Controls. <\/b> I can't put controls in pros just because there are minor issues in camera movement i found frustrating. Apart from that everything is fine and the fact that you need only mouse gives out an idea how simple everything is in Sketch! Run!.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> CONS <\/div><br><b> Level design. <\/b> Pictures are nice and levels itself are good enough but there comes a bad part. Lots of levels are very similar to each other what makes game a bit repetetive but since game is that easy and casual you don't think about that too much and play along. One more flaw in level design is some obstacles placement. There are few Erasers (obstacle which deletes you instantly and you have to start over) placed in very bad places and it feels like you need luck to get past them. Amount of different obstacles type is very small. There is no variations in visuals of same obstacle and all of them looks same.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Conclusion <\/div><br><b> I do recommend this game. <\/b> Even after some flaws i can recommend this game because of it's easy nature. It is so casual that you don't feel doing much while playing and just enjoy. Sountrack makes it more enjoyable and in full view makes it easy to play.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30944963', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30944963' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30944963\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30944963' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30944963\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30944963', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30944963_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30944963_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">In the past 7 days<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30858075\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ProofreadFire\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"76511597\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de3a4eaca5146c4002186e98b8400a442bff3c65.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de3a4eaca5146c4002186e98b8400a442bff3c65.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/de\/de3a4eaca5146c4002186e98b8400a442bff3c65_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ProofreadFire\/\" data-miniprofile=\"76511597\">ProofreadFire<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ProofreadFire\/games\/?tab=all\">129 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ProofreadFire\/recommended\/\">72 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ProofreadFire\/recommended\/602920\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Sketch!
