I backed the game on Kickstarter, so I got early access. The four hours game time recorded by steam were enough to for me to finish the game. There is not much replayability. The game has the &quot;War room&quot; mode for instant battles (that I have not tired yet), but the limited complexity of the combat (see below) is unlikely to give this feature longevity<br>* A significant fraction of the game time is spend in in-engine cut-scenes without interactivity. Telling the story.<br>* The story is interesting and touches a number of concepts from transhumanist philosophy (I'd love to discuss it further, but want to avoid spoilers). It has some more and some less surprising twists.<br>* In case you were wondering - there does not seem to be any branching story-line, apparently the player can not influence the outcome in any way<br>* The voice acting is quite exceptional (especially for an indie game), as is the music<br>* unfortunately, I found the characters to be a bit &quot;tropy&quot; and one-dimensional, especially as there are not one but two &quot;revenge stories&quot;<br><br>The gameplay takes a bit of a back seat:<br>* For me (using a decent quality gaming headset) the speech recognition worked very well, even tough English is not my native language. There were a few words that consistently were not recognised, so I switched to the mouse for those after a while. I have not tried changing the standard commands.<br>* it was an interesting experience to use voice commands, and I don't believe it has been so integral to any game before<br>* the combat itself is not particularly complex or dificult. I played on &quot;Medium&quot; (the preset difficulty) and got through most battles in the first try<br>* the characters shoot automatically, and in most situations it is just a matter of ordering them to the appropriate position and wait for the enemies to be shot. Each character has one (later two) of four special weapon modes equipped that can be selected, but require &quot;energy&quot; (which is equivalent to character health in the game). There are no special abilities.<br>* voice-controlled instant-failure stealth section - I'm not a fan, sorry.<br><br>All in all, the game was an unusual and fun but also short and in some places flawed experience. It is not particularly expensive, so if you can spare the money (or wait for a sale) and are willing to accept the weaknesses, I would recommend it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14641272', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14641272' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14641272\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14641272' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14641272\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14641272', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14641272_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14641272_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t74 of 106 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14640064\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"41482842\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3e5a0d25ccf48c03eaa4eebe80b9d6c1dfa38694.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3e5a0d25ccf48c03eaa4eebe80b9d6c1dfa38694.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3e\/3e5a0d25ccf48c03eaa4eebe80b9d6c1dfa38694_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/\" data-miniprofile=\"41482842\">FreakOrama<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/games\/?tab=all\">854 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/recommended\/\">146 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FreakOramaXD\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere Came An Echo is an innovative, or just plain great, real-time strategy game that pits you in the shoes of a commander, with either voice controls or normal KBM controls, issuing various commands to your squad using its immersive voice recognition system. So let's start.<br><br>The graphics are slick and smooth, with beautiful colors and effects, and the animations being sufficient and somewhat oddly charming, followed by a nice clean edgy UI. The soundtrack is fitting with the game, and it's awesome, being catchy, diverse, and filled with a sense of.. justice and adventure to reach one's goal in the coolest possible way, with having an epiphany at some point.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=agg6dn_GecY&amp;list=UU-bYm-N2k6pVVh1YQHCsCqA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=agg6dn_GecY&amp;list=UU-bYm-N2k6pVVh1YQHCsCqA<\/a><br><br>There are two types of controls, the main one being voice controls, which is not perfect in any way, but actually works decently, and it has a lot of options for you to make it work, where you can choose the type of language you speak, or if you have an accent, which is nice, but obviously not every language is included. I had a problem with the game to recognize my voice when I called on one one of the character names, so I added a custom name that it could recognize, and it worked smoothly, at least a lot better than before. So if the game's voice recognition doesn't work for you, you can 'make' it work, and you can make it fun too with most if not all commands being customizable. To note again, it's obviously not perfect but it's functional and playable, aside from a few frustrating moments where it would just not work. It's something new in games that isn't played with a lot, it's working and I like it. I'd also advise to make it push to talk, as I got better controls with it.<br><br>Going to gameplay, playing with the voice controls, it's fun, easy, and you feel this sense of immense immersion as the whole game is somewhat fourth-wall breaking, bringing you, as the person behind the screen, into the game's story, world, and its interactions between characters, making you feel like a necessary part in the game's universe, an important role as an independent character, and that's a really awesome feeling.<br><br>Going to actual gameplay elements aside from what I said, you issue commands to your squad like to 'move to' a certain location, 'open fire' on an enemy, 'take cover' or 'hold position', and preform complex tasks immediately or at certain times of your choosing. You can also customize your squade in terms of what types of weapons they can carry and what type of passive ability they hold. The game also has nice progression in terms of difficulty curves, slowly but surely increasing it over time, over missions. It's fun and strategic, and somehow it achieved simplicity in its complexity.<br><br>The story of the game is satisfying, with a type of story that doesn't get covered in games much, reminding me of certain futuristic\/sci-fi cartoon shows but more advanced, which is kind of nice and refreshing. The characters are really diverse, unique, and fun to watch their actions and interactions with each other, with great voice acting too, with each one having their own story that's made visible to the player. They also have mystery characters leaving you curious and excited to know their identity and their story. Also, the game plays its characters as normal people of this day and age, and nice mentions of what we have now in terms of tech and social media, with fun references that made me laugh when mentioned\/revealed.<br><br>Back to story again, just wanted to add that the more I was nearing to the end of it, the more I was satisfied and in love with it, with how it was going. A lot of emotions rising, twists turning, fourth-walls being demolished, and the ending was amazing. My satisfaction liquid in my head was boiling. It was that freaking good to me, and I honestly didn't expect it from the game. I applaud and thank the writer(s) of the game for their awesome work, and heck the game should feature &quot;Awesome Story Writing&quot; in its store page.<br><br>I want more games like this, with the creative freedom actually being free from shackles of limitations, going full on out, with the all passion and love going in it. For that asking price, the game is a steal. There Came An Echo is just a fantastic, creative, unique, innovative, fun, charming, awesome game. The graphics are desirable and beautiful, the soundtrack is one to admire, the gameplay of tactics and strategy, with the applied voice controls are fun, intense, exciting, and immersive. The story is wondrous, and the whole presentation is top-notch, heck the game's presentation and story was even more cinematic than a game that was designed to be cinematic *wink*. The whole game is one to be awarded, as it deserves mine and a lot more. I hope they make a sequel with all out better tech, better tools, better everything so they can make their next game in that universe even better, and I cannot wait to see what the same developers ,with the same creative freedom, innovation, and support, do next.<br><br>Shameless <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.ksalue.com\/_\/review\/my-thoughts-on-there-came-an-echo-review-r713\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >link<\/a> to original post.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14640064', 'summary' );

In light of recent revelations involving the NSA and GCHQ spying on much of the world\u2019s internet traffic, encryption has become a hot button issue. Whether you know how it works or not, it\u2019s there securing your online presence against unwanted intruders.  And yet, how often do you stop and think about the people who make your communications and data secure? Not often, I\u2019ll wager.  In There Came An Echo, Corrin is one of those people, one of those geniuses, you might say. He\u2019s your typical computer whizz and he is about to become embroiled in something larger than himself, or anything the physical world has to offer.<br><br>Corrin anonymously released an open source encryption software into the public domain, called Radial Lock. Its claim to fame is that it cannot be broken in any way, and its open source code is testament to that, but there\u2019s one problem: the hardware to support it does not exist yet. Or so Corrin thinks.  Unbeknownst to him, Radial Lock has been put into use by a shadowy organisation and it is securing some highly coveted data. He quickly finds himself backed into his office whilst armed troopers search for him, and that\u2019s where Val and Sam come in.<br><br>Val acts as Corrin\u2019s assistant and overseer, while Sam takes on the role of commander and provides the orders that will keep him safe. You will assume control of  Sam and direct Corrin, and his comrades, through dicey situations to find out who is searching for him, and for what cause. You won\u2019t be using traditional control methods to guide Corrin though, granted they are there if you want to, instead you are encouraged to use nothing more than the power of your voice to guide him on his dangerous mission.<br><br>\u201cVoice controls?\u201d, I hear you moan dubiously. \u201cYes, voice controls\u201d, I retort in a confident manner. There Came An Echo\u2018s main draw, aside from sporting Wil Wheaton as the voice of Corrin, is that you can control the game almost entirely with your voice. Past games have attempted this to some degree of success, but never in a way that felt essential, or anything other than an afterthought. There Came An Echo brings this control scheme front and centre,, with Val gently guiding you through the game\u2019s various systems, such as movement, weapon swapping and attacking. The system is quite robust, allowing you to order multiple units around at the same time, or dish out commands to all but one unit. Within a few minutes of getting to grips with the voice commands I began to feel distinctly like I was gaming in the future. This is what a gaming evolution should feel like.<br><br>Ordering Corrin and his accomplices around is so smooth and intuitive that it becomes second nature almost immediately, but there are some caveats that you will need to understand fully before beginning. While the voice command system is incredibly in-depth, and works with many different dialects and accents, even my Scottish accent, it relies on you being clear and enunciating each and every word. If you mumble or shout Val will pop up on-screen to let you know that no one can understand what you are saying. Be it through necessity, or just my wish to stop having Val pop up on my screen, I quickly learned the ins and outs of the system.<br><br>Controlling Corrrin using nothing other than my voice was an absolute blast. Aside from the few times where the voice recognition system refused to play ball, everything played out so cleanly that I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. And that is no understatement. Telling units, calmly and clearly, to switch guns and travel to new defensive points on the map, and seeing them do exactly as I said is something of a watershed moment in gaming for me.  You don\u2019t have complete control over your units though, and they do not have the ability to freely roam each level, instead there are zones dotted throughout each area which you will guide Corrin to using the phonetic alphabet. So, if you want Corrin to go to Alpha One, you would simply say \u201cCorrin go to alpha 1\u2033. Or, if you are lazy like me you can simply say \u201cCorrin, Alpha 1\u2033, and he will run towards that location. In the heat of battle you will be dishing out orders at a brisk pace, so remember to be calm and clear, you\u2019ll have a much more fun if you do. You\u2019ll also get to feel like an awesome tactician!<br><br>All missions in There Came An Echo play out very similarly, first starting out with a load out screen where you can choose each party member\u2019s guns and perks. As well as the bog-standard pistol you can choose a secondary weapon which drains your energy bar as you use it. Energy is important because it powers your shields, so you\u2019ll want to use your sidearm carefully and effectively. Although it is possible to use your pistol for most of the combat, you will probably struggle to proceed in some of the tougher parts of the game.<br><br>Finding yourself under heavy fire from enemies wielding charge guns is a common occurrence, but you can turn the tables on them by laying down suppressive fire with the screw gun. When your opponents are on the backfoot you can then attempt to flank them with a unit or two, and hit them with a taste of their own medicine. Let me tell you, there are few more exhilirating feelings than successfully outwitting your enemies in There Came An Echo.  Each level is dotted with these tactical opportunities which highlight wonderfully just how responsive and fun the voice recognition system can be. Admittedly, the action is formulaic but Iridium throw a few curveballs in there to keep you on your toes, too.<br><br>As a spoiler-free review I won\u2019t delve too much into There Came An Echo\u2019s story, but it is filled with deceit, mistrust, love and greed. You may even come away questioning the nature of your very existence. With multiple agencies out to find him, Corrin is torn in multiple different directions by people who want to use him for their own gain. Over the course of the game he transforms from a nerdy, bookish type into a man who is able to take the initiative and do what needs to be done to ensure his survival. The highest of praise should be lavished upon the entire voice cast for bringing a touch of emotion and realism to what can otherwise be a sterile genre. Wheaton, in particular, shines with a solid performance throughout.<br><br>There Came An Echo could be the title that takes voice controlled games into the mainstream. Voice recognition should no longer be a selling point to be cynically emblazoned upon a game\u2019s box, in the hopes that consumers who don\u2019t know any better will buy it.  It should be here to stay, and the hard work that Iridium have put in should be refined and incremented upon for future titles. Quite simply, it sets a standard by which all future games with voice controls should be judged.<br><br>More please.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Disclosure: review copy provided by Iridium.

I did however purchase the soundtrack after playing it.<br><br>Time to completion: Around 4 hours.<br>Replay value: Not much.<br><br>I think that this is a good game, but a cautious recommendation. It is an almost fully voice-controlled squad-style RTS. As such the strategy is a simple set of commands you can give your team such as &quot;All Units Move to Alpha 1&quot; and &quot;Corrin Attack Target 2.&quot; However the voice commands worked very well for me and when everything clicks it really feels like you are a commander of a small squad. I can definitely make you feel very cool.<br><br>Pros:<br> - AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. I mean seriously, wow. Big Giant Circles + Ronald Jenkees = eargasm.<br> - Good story, well written characters.<br> - Great voice acting with big name talent like Laura Bailey (\u2665), Wil Wheaton, Ashly Burch, and Yuri Lowenthal.<br> - The feeling of being a commander through voice control alone.<br> - Inventive game mechanics. I've never really played anything like it. Now that the mechanics are in place I would love to see a sequel.<br> - Beautiful 2D visuals.<br> - You can create funny aliases for commands. <br><br>Cons:<br> - Lacking polish in some areas. I ran into various bugs with the UI clipping on my 16:10 display and some scripting errors that caused my teammates to refuse to fire their weapons. The developers seem very intent to fix these issues so this might be fixed by the time you read this anyway.<br> - Voice control can sometimes fail and can be very frustrating. Even 95% accuracy is really annoying 5% of the time.<br> - Occasionally some awkward dialog that could have benefited from an editor.<br> - Short game at around 4 hours in length without much replayability.<br> - Some animations show their low budget-ness. There are some awkward motions and poses.<br><br>My recommendation: If you're frugal it's worth $10 so look out for a sale. The soundtrack however is worth every penny.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14642880', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14642880' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14642880\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14642880' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14642880\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14642880', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14642880_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14642880_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16823688\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meteorain988\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"45330353\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/522285f5a11d3e69623983cb1b54d21da509c0bc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/522285f5a11d3e69623983cb1b54d21da509c0bc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/52\/522285f5a11d3e69623983cb1b54d21da509c0bc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meteorain988\/\" data-miniprofile=\"45330353\">Meteorain<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meteorain988\/games\/?tab=all\">197 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meteorain988\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/meteorain988\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 1, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery surprised by how well the voice commands work.

The game starts out in a reenactment of the beginning of The Matrix. The story follows Corrin, a cryptographer, as he tries to find out why people want to break his software, Radial Lock. The story seemed generic to me, but the comedy was a great distraction. The gameplay is solid if you are using the voice controlled method, but the keyboard\/mouse controls are very bad. Along with the bad keyboard\/mouse controls, the main story is very short, and there is no extra content after the campaign. The voice controls are done extremely well, and even if the game doesn\u2019t understand something, you can change the words for each command to suit you.  <br> <div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros              <\/div>      <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">      \n    <li>Refreshing gameplay<br>    <\/li><li>Funny interactions<br>    <\/li><li>Voice commands can be fully customized <br>    <\/li><li>Matrix references (makes any game better \uf04a) <br>    <\/li><li>The story is told well<br>    <\/li><li>Great voice acting <br>  <br>    <\/li><\/ul>      <br>      <br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Cons             <\/div>      <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">      \n    <li>Voice control can be off<br>    <\/li><li>Story seems generic<br>    <\/li><li>Bad keyboard\/mouse support<br>    <\/li><li>Short story<br>    <\/li><li>No content after the story mode<br>    <\/li><li>No multiplayer<br><br> <\/li><\/ul>      <br>    <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">  Conclusion                <\/div>     <br> \t There Came an Echo is a very unique RTS with amazingly done voice controls. Even though the story is short and there is no content story after the campaign, I recommend you buy There Came an Echo when it goes on sale. This is just one of those games you must experience because of the amazingly implemented voice control.  <br><br><br>-HiPFiRED  <br><br><br><i> If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i><br><br><i>Check out the Original Network Groups.

I've played Sequence (renamed Before the Echo) a few years ago, and recently replayed it. It's a blast!<br><br>So yeah, this being the second game from Iridium Studios, I wanted to try it.<br><br>It wasn't quite was I expected in many ways, and I was disappointed, overall. Regardless of its faults, though, it did try to do something new, making the whole game playable with Voice Commands. It's the first time I've seen it done and, although it was rough around the edges, it was fully functional! And in some ways it certainly enhanced the experience!<br><br><br>The story seemed interesting, at first, but I found it very convoluted as the game went on, trying to fit every trendy Computer Science subject into its story, without any time to flesh it out. It turned out to pull a trick every 30 minutes, 15 of which were spent in battle. It started as a Cryptography\/Privacy problem (Snowden), went through <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> superintelligence, brain emulation\/uploading, brain and memory reconstruction from data (cloning), we're all living in a simulated universe,<\/span><\/span>... In a game that was less than 4 hours (the credits were like 30 minutes), there are far too many ringing words pulled out of nowhere, because they sounded cool. Not my cup of tea. <br><br>And I like sci-fi! But... not when every concept is thrown into a very tight space. <br><br>Anyway...<br><br>The good part about the narrative, though, is how the voice-commands fit in. The whole game is voice-acted, and you give orders to the characters in the game, who sometimes reply (although in a generic way), and make you part of the story, at times.<br>It was mostly surprising how the voice acting seemed to make the narrative much more engaging, to me, because of the my own voice commands. It all fit in, and I think it was the best use of the voice-recognition feature in the game. Because you were being talked to, and talking back, it all felt more real, in a sense. I'd like to see more of this direction in other games!<br><br>Gameplay-wise, it's nothing special. If not for the voice commands, it would be quite the contrary. You simply move units from A to B (each spot is given a name like AlphaX, with X being a number). You ask character NAME to move to A, and focus on EnemyX. You can also switch weapons, but that's about it.<br><br>The voice commands have a certain latency associated with them, taking about 1 seconds to be recognized. And some of them are missed, although surprisingly few, to me (a foreign speaker). Because of this, the game couldn't really rely on precise commands and too tactical gameplay. Even though there are subtleties to the mechanics, they most pass unnoticed, because the technology isn't perfect, yet.<br><br>There's also very little gameplay in the game. It's mostly cutscenes, with a bit of combat between them.<br><br><br><br>All in all, I don't think it's very good. But it's also innovative, and there were some uniquely positive aspects in the game as a result! So it will get a recommendation, but mostly for people who are curious about how the voice commands play out.<br>As I said, I think they really enhance the narrative, making game story-telling more promising than we're used to.<br>The story was very messy, to me, and the gameplay was very light.<br>If you're okay with it, give it a shot. Either way, I'm looking forward to what Iridium Studios come up next!<br><br><br>P.S.: specific point about the story, full of spoilers <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span><br>The game shows a &quot;God&quot; intelligence that is far too human, to be honest... if it's from another universe, far more resourceful, should it be very alien? And have vastly different motivations? I just don't like the way it aims at grandeur, but ends up falling very short, with the so called &quot;Anthropomorphism&quot;, which is a nice sounding word for, in this case, &quot;aliens\/other intelligences are probably weird and not very human&quot;.<\/span><\/span>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25216350', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25216350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25216350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25216350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25216350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25216350', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25216350_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25216350_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary16489739\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009151053\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48885325\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/132058c9c8f064aa1c04aa0fea49f8c533d0a49e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/132058c9c8f064aa1c04aa0fea49f8c533d0a49e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/132058c9c8f064aa1c04aa0fea49f8c533d0a49e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009151053\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48885325\">Palantheir<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009151053\/games\/?tab=all\">262 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009151053\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009151053\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLong story short, this game is really damn amazing.

Combined with the ability to create your own voice commands, this game can be either Highly customizable to the point where you just want to say &quot;SHUT UP, WESLEY!&quot; for every action in-game<br><br>Voice acting in this game is rather well done. With such talent as Ashly Burch and Wil Wheaton in the cast, you come out with characters that almost seem like they could be people you meet up on in real life(barring a few acceptions).  With the combination of background music made by Big Giant Circles and Ronald Jenkees, It can really get your Blood flowing.<br><br>With that being said, It is by no means perfect. As I stated before, Voice commands are no-where near perfect but the technology can be improved by either upgrading you microphone or creating your own commands. There are times when the camera is wrestled away from you and you can't see what the hell you are doing but those moments are far and few between. Voice acting at times can feel hammy but, again, I feel those moments are far and few between. The BIGGEST concern is that this game feels a bit short. With only Ten missions to go on, It feels that a lot was cut from the game. <br><br>All in all, Not perfect, still great, kinda hoping that there is a sequel or DLC.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16489739', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16489739' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16489739\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16489739' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16489739\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16489739', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16489739_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16489739_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24304843\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"134801616\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d4\/d45530e95d203293fe34f0e9c776e267d40292c4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d4\/d45530e95d203293fe34f0e9c776e267d40292c4.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d4\/d45530e95d203293fe34f0e9c776e267d40292c4_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/\" data-miniprofile=\"134801616\">garretta706<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/games\/?tab=all\">957 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/garretta706\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has Ashly Burch. 10\/10.<br>Seriously, this game is amazing, assuming you can actually get the voice commands to work.

I'm not native speaker ;)<br><br>This game was in my wishlist for some time. Today (06\/30\/2015), I saw it was on sale and I had to take a look. Guys! I bought it! And I found the game to be very immersive, lots of action, funny, great story and development, nice jokes and references\/easter eggs, smooth well optimized graphics, engaging soundtrack. The characters are crazy, lol. They talk to you and in this game YOU talk to them :D. The concept is great. Even if you don't have a microphone, mouse and keyboard do the trick very well. It has subtitles. And (surprise!) I could install and run this game on a 32 bits Windows 8.1 OS flawlessly. <br><br><b>Regarding to OST, when I saw &quot;Additional vocals by Malukah (Judith de los Santos)&quot;, the mouse pointer was instantly moved to &quot;add to cart&quot; button<\/b>. <br><br>For the ones who (yet) don't know Malukah's works (Skyrim, Halo 4, Mass Effect,  Call of Duty: Black Ops II, The Banner Saga, for example), Google it.

The voice controls generally work about 97% of the time for me (only one character, Syll, gives it trouble semi-regularly). If you enuciate, differentiate your commands with a pause, and use a headset, it works extremely well. That said, in the heat of battle sometimes it's hard to remember to enunciate and pause for breath :P<br><br>The story is definitely a thinker; great introspection material here. The characters are well done, even the characters you want to hate, and moral gray areas abound. Some phenom voice talent as well. The soundtrack? I listen to it outside the game all the time. Ronald Jenkees and Great Big Circles are <i>amazing<\/i>.<br><br>The graphics aren't fantastic, but they're pretty damn good for an indie game of this caliber. The tactical combat isn't super deep, but frankly, with voice controls and the learning curve around them, I wouldn't expect it to be too crazy. It is short, ~3 hours of gameplay + story for the campaign, which for me was just about right I think, but for some folks that may be too short of an experience.<br><br>As a WoW raid leader, I felt like I was directing my raiders around the battlefield. It's a familiar feeling in that respect, but it's definitely a novel experience in a standalone video game form.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30604843', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30604843' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30604843\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30604843' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30604843\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30604843', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30604843_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30604843_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30034735\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198067974184\/recommended\/319740\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"107708456\">sauerdough<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere came an Echo is a brand new twist on all other RTS games.

Generally speaking, I play games, and I don't review unless a game is either very good and I've beaten it, or very bad and I never intend to. This game is, in my opinion, part of the former category, in case you want the quick and dirty, I feel this game is good, you should buy it. ESPECIALLY if you played it's prequel Before the Echo (Also known as Sequence) and want to see more of the world from that game.<br><br>But let's talk about how the game a little more in depth now.<br><br>STORY:<br><br>This game does not require you to have played it's prequel to be enjoyable. It explains itself fairly well, however, I had the lovliest &quot;OH MY GOD WAT?!&quot; moment in the middle of the game since I'd played Sequence, and I think that it greatly enhanced my investment in the story.<br><br>So, what is the story? Well, at the beginning it's a story about Corrin, a chap who made a really complex algothym that shouldn't be able to exist beyond theory, but does. And then it spirals into a headtrip of existentialism and commentary on &quot;What's it all about man?&quot; so smoothly that you sort of just roll with it. Some how said that it's a bit jarring, but I think those are people who didn't come in from the prequel, which was also a bit of a headtrip. Personal tastes may vary, but if you're a person who enjoys thinking on the nature of life and the universe, you will likely quite enjoy this game. If you like your stories more grounded, it might be a turn off for you.<br><br>GAMEPLAY:<br><br>Story is all well and good, but if the system running it doesn't work, then what good is it right? Well, There came and echo does not disappoint in my opinion. Full disclosure, I am a native english speaker and my accent has been described by multiple people as &quot;Disgustingly neutral&quot; So perhaps I have an advantage here, but I felt the voice recognition was very on point. The instances where I felt the game unfairly or wrongly processed my voice were very few and far between and by and large I feel the gimmick works very well and was very immersive. I would love to play another game like this in the future. Should you have a heavy accent, crappy mic, or such, the game IS still entirely playable with the mouse and keyboard as if it were any other RTS.<br><br>How is the RTS part then? Well, I'm not a deep player of the genre, but I feel it's passiable. It serves it's gimmic well and the difficulty never gets TOO high. If you're a big RTS fan you may find it a bit Shallow, but it was good enough for what it was, and I feel the gameplay kept me engaged for the story, and the story kept me going through the gameplay.<br><br>Music:<br><br>Rock Solid, very enjoyable tracks that never STAND OUT, but also fit the tone of the game very well. There's not a hell of a lot to say here.<br><br>Voice acting:<br><br>The entire game is voice acted, and the cast nails it in my opinion, Some fairly big names on the list this time too, Wil Weaton being the big one of course. But I don't feel like anyone really falls behind in their role, the lines are delieved with the right tone and at no point did anyone's delivery take me out of the moment.<br><br>Price point:<br><br>If you get it within two weeks of this review, Indie Gala has it in the 5 dollar category, and I feel it's well worth 5 dollars on it's own. Having played it, I'd probably cough up 15 for it personally, but again, I'm a mark for the sort of story it's telling and was a huge fan of the prequel.<br><br>Anyway, that's about all I have to say, this game has it's flaws, and it's a bit short, but it kept me pretty riveted for an afternoon, and while the replay value is shotty at best, I do feel the experience is worth the money.
