At least, without a doubt, one of the best titles this year, by far. Let me tell you why that is.<br><br>These guys put many AAA Studios that release blockbusters to shame. Simply because these other studios spend hundreds of millions on useless stuff like advertising and marketing, and other unnecessary overhead costs, they probably spend all the money on pizza parties every day for example. But what I\u2019m trying to get at here is that these guys, on a not so high budget, have managed to produce a high quality racer, that is either on par, or above par with a lot of triple A releases. Let\u2019s talk about this in more detail.<br><br>The graphics, now I\u2019m going to admit here, this isn\u2019t their best asset for the game, it\u2019s not ultra-realistic, even though it is pretty close. However, if these guys have made Chariot Wars as good looking to most other megaton releases, then not only is OM Entertainment talented, I ask the other developers out there, how in the hell do you get away with spending so much money on new graphical technology, when there is barely any difference from your last game release?<br><br>Ok, onto the gameplay. There is a rush of adrenaline when each race starts, you\u2019ll want to ram and make your opponents crash, while you race onwards. The sense of speed and danger of your opponents possibly catching up behind you will have you on the edge of your seat, trying to keep ahead and control of your chariot. Honestly, it\u2019s really hard to put this into words, so I\u2019ll simply say, it\u2019s just amazing.<br><br>We also can\u2019t forget about the variety in locations and everything else. You can select multiple characters, and multiple different chariots with nice highly detailed designs to make yourself look more intimidating to your competition.  You can get an extra advantage over others if you choose the right type of horse depending on the map, which leads it into more of a thinking game of what to choose to out-do your opponents. Hats off to the developers for bringing some depth and variety to the selection process before each race including the nice selection of maps to choose from. <br><br>Speaking of the maps it\u2019s nice to see highly detailed locations in Ancient Greece Egypt, and Gaul. You\u2019ll actually spot some nice landmarks on some of the maps so you\u2019ll know fairly quickly, where you are if you\u2019re a history and geography fanatic like I am.<br><br>Really looking forward to the Multiplayer update, I\u2019ll update this when it\u2019s in the game to talk about it!<br><br>I can\u2019t recommend this game enough, people need to play it and experience it for themselves. YouTube videos, or broadcasts from Steam, Twitch or YouTube don\u2019t do this game justice, you REALLY need to play it to get the real sense of dynamic rich content there is in this little gem of a game. We need to support more developers like this that are brave and bold enough to still release quality releases like this that are truly unique and not afraid to try something new.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('16415637', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '16415637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary16415637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '16415637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary16415637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '16415637', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16415637_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary16415637_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/365460\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 10 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["16415637"]}
