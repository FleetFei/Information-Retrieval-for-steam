From what I understand, this version is a graphical and interface upgrade, but the main game play and story is similar to what I experienced originally with some modifications and some things that are more fleshed out.  If I get a chance to play this iteration, I will update this review with more comments.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend the game if you like old school, grid based, movement type RPGs that were similar to the original Might &amp; Magic games with good pacing, class and spell design, balanced with some challenging, but fair game play.  While the graphics will not compete directly with AAA modern titles, the monster portraits and game scenes can still be quite appealing to look at.  Another big plus for me is you can actually have 6 party members so you can have one of each available class in your party and they are all quite useful including a Fighter, Paladin, Archer, Thief, Priest and Sorceress.<br><br>OLD COMMENTS:<br><br>I had time to download and play the demo for a bit yesterday and was able to pick it up pretty quickly even without looking at the manual at all. It was familiar enough to the old classics that I was able to jump right in. There are a few mechanics and tactics I didn't try yet, but the basics of fighting, buying\/selling, and equipping the party were pretty straightforward so far. It probably helped me a lot that I played the old classic Might &amp; Magic 1 last year as much of the original interface was very similar. I must say that I liked the option to inspect an item and it would show you which class could use the item and damage stats, etc. Also, when I tried to equip a shield while already wielding a 2h weapon, it popped a yellow message up explaining to me that I already had a 2h weapon equipped. I wasn't expecting that level of feedback.<br><br>I got my party up to level 7 and unlocked the 4th tier of spells. At first I was a little bummed there would only be 5 tiers of spells, but all the spells are pretty useful even though there are only 4 priest and sorc spells per level. The total spell count may be lower, but the actual usefulness of them seems to be very high compared to similar games.<br><br>At first I didn't like the way water\/holy water was handled and the sorc runes that you needed to loot to cast the more powerful spells. However, now that I have been playing a while, it just feels right and I can tell there was a lot of thought put into how it would affect game-play and strategy. It is a nice twist on a familiar mechanic.<br><br>I was concerned a few times whether I was progressing in the proper manner\/order in game, but never ended up being frustrated. By just exploring each map systematically, I was stumbling into all relevant and important events (I think). A few times the monsters seemed to be a bit over-tuned, but then I would soon uncover an item or spell that made them a lot easier to deal with, so I would say personally the game flows very well and the difficulty is just right.<br><br>So far the game hasn't grown stale at all, which I am pleasantly surprised with. The pace that new enemies show up with new tactics and the pace that you grow in power through new items and\/or spells seems to be just right. I am quite impressed you did this alone. Your efforts at polish in game-play show. Granted, this is ignoring some of the graphics and re-usable sound effects, etc, but concentrating on the core tactics and game-play, I am getting a good experience.<br><br>Now I am genuinely interested in finishing the game, or at least progressing further. If there are 15-20 areas\/maps? I guess I am only about a third of the way through and easily have over 10 hours into it already I would say. The encounters are already getting pretty tough so I can only imagine what you have in store as I get into the end game.<br><br>END OF OLDER COMMENTS<br><br>I now recall that I never did finish the game to get to the end game content, but it was more due to my lack of focus and ability to stick with one game (any game) than this game specifically.  Perhaps I will give it another shot in this new engine\/interface and make it a bit further!<br><br>Watch the available video clips and screenshots and if you can get by the interface and older style graphics, there is some very elegant old school RPG goodness in here.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19721115', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19721115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19721115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19721115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19721115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19721115', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19721115_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19721115_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19893639\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"51625428\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fb\/fb03c70f49b00e263e6b857075aa2cf08c6e9efe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51625428\">Jargonaut<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/games\/?tab=all\">612 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198011891156\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">71.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is one of the best old school, turned based RPG that I have played for years.<br><br>BTW, I am an older gamer that has been playing RPGs for the last 35+ years, starting from Wizardy 1 in 1980. I played all the Wizardrys, Ultimas, Bard Tales and Might &amp; Magic Series. <br><br>This game reminds me of all those past games that I have played in the past with its square grid layout and its very engaging storyline. You can also have a team of 6 different members and there are 6 different classes each with very different and unique skills. This game is also slightly different than most normal RPG in that Sorcerers need to collect Runes to cast spells, and Priests needs to prepare a supply of Holy Water. Of course you also need to be near some water supply like Stream or Lake so you can have access to water.  It is little things like this that makes the game more interesting and different. <br><br>The developer also put in a lot of effort into creating different kind of dungeons with different mechanics and behavior that are uniquely distinctive. For example, in the Water Realm, there are currents and you get swept away to different location based on the current. In the Air Realm, you will fall to your death, and can only teleport to certain location using a transdisplacer device. In Earth Realm you might have to re-materialized behind the rock to discover new tunnels, etc. In Fire you have constant Inferno effect damaging you with every move and lots of other surprises. <br><br>I love games with Steam Achievements, and it is possible to get all 20\/20 steam achievements in a single playthrough. I spend about 70 hours in a single playthrough. This game especially reward grinding and have monsters that repopulate so that you can grind till your heart content. You also get decent drops and experienes through grinding too.<br><br>Overall, I loved this game and would highly recommend it to any old school RPG gamers. Its definitely worth the money spent.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19893639', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19893639' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19893639\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19893639' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19893639\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19893639', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19893639_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19893639_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19754731\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jjm319\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"49940590\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/7809f47f32a8ed3809494e294c76e7ee5e12c734.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/7809f47f32a8ed3809494e294c76e7ee5e12c734.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/78\/7809f47f32a8ed3809494e294c76e7ee5e12c734_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jjm319\/\" data-miniprofile=\"49940590\">jjm319<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jjm319\/games\/?tab=all\">2,798 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jjm319\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/jjm319\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you played and liked the old Might and Magic or Wizardry games get this game.<br><br>I played this game before it came to Steam. This is an old school grid based RPG with an improved interface. I still enjoy the style of these type of RPG but was unable to go back and enjoy the originals because of the clunky interface. This game with an easy interface is exactly what I wanted, I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next game the developer is creating with a similar engine. <br><br>Some will find the game very unfair, and especially starting out you will die easy and it seems unfairly. It\u2019s not nearly as punishing as the original M&amp;M I and Bards Tale I. I actually like starting so weak because it makes the progression that much more visible. Also the combat and exploration have a certain puzzle flavor to them. There are certain challenge humps that are hard to get past but I am glad they are there. I remember particularly a room in the catacombs and some of the lower levels which seemed particularly unfair. It just means you have to be very careful, and also understand how you can use the order of turned based combat, and maybe change some characters speed so they go before others. The thief is very important for some of the special attacks it has.<br><br>This has about 100hrs worth of content if you like to explore every square and it may be hard for an adult to find the time to finish; but since it is save anywhere out of combat and combat is short it is actually very friendly to being played in small chunks.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19754731', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19754731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19754731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19754731' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19754731\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19754731', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19754731_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19754731_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20192066\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008161050\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"47895322\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88c3d66209cb6c4e10bebf9ea6286ecd6b309d71.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88c3d66209cb6c4e10bebf9ea6286ecd6b309d71.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88c3d66209cb6c4e10bebf9ea6286ecd6b309d71_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008161050\/\" data-miniprofile=\"47895322\">Darklord<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008161050\/games\/?tab=all\">151 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008161050\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198008161050\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">42.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd complete! :) First up, it was very enjoyable, I played the game a couple of years ago and didn't quite finish it, this time though I did with 40 hours on the clock. The game has been enhanced since then, and now looks nicer than I recall.<br><br><b>WARNING - This contains many spoilers.<\/b><br><br><b>Party\/Levels<\/b><br><br>Human Paladin - 15<br>Dwarf Knight - 15<br>Elf Archer - 15<br>Gnome Rogue - 15<br>Dwarf Priest - 14<br>Human Sorceress - 14<br><br><b>Difficulty<\/b> - The game was much easier than I recalled from 2013, and I while I did recall a little bit tactic wise. (mostly equip all luck bonuses etc and save before leveling up, as the HP\/SP can vary massively) I did this last time too. The game really was easier than it used to be, last time I recall the mummies were really tough, this time I killed them all first time every time. Very little was that much of a challenge this time through. I didn't bother with using the cross in the final combat. (I forgot it to be honest) The big bad guy was very easy, only getting to act once, the rest of the time he was imprisoned.<br><br>The Prison spell made combats very easy once I got it, with that and abilities such as Arrowstorm and Godsend especially. Now had been willing to accept random level ups the game would have been more challenging earlier but irrelevant later as my enemies were typically Imprisoned or Stunned. <br><br>My typical end game fight was Archer - Arrowstorm, Sorc - Prison three, Rogue - stun one, once enemies turns have passed, Priest and Paladin - Godsend\/heal if needed etc. Finally Knight - Attack\/Berserk. By waiting when needed very few enemies would get to act if any.<br><br>Personally I would love to see a difficulty option, for those who like more challenge, increasing enemy stats etc. (speed especially, after a certain point my key members went first against every enemy bar the end boss, and my Archer was still faster!)<br><br>NOTE - While I found the game relatively easy, I have played a lot of similar games over the years, I notice others saying this game was way too hard for them so I guess everyone has a different perspective!<br><br><b>Playability<\/b> - Great, the game plays very well all the way up to around level 10 or so the game was varied it was only once I learnt the level 5 spells the game became somewhat repetitious. All on that after level 10 or so, you don't unlock anything new, I think the Paladin getting level 5 spells being the last exception, it would have been nice to get a little more late game, for variety if nothing else.<br><br><b>Class\/Race Thoughts<\/b><br><br><b>Paladin<\/b> - Other than Astrid there isn't really a decent magic weapon for her, her Godsend was nice enough but it would have been nice to find a Paladin only magic sword. (Unless I missed this?) The best I found was The Blades of Wrath which were obviously designed for the Rogue.<br><br><b>Archer <\/b>- Most powerful damage dealer by far once I got Burst then Arrowstorm, there is only one super bow of course, so two probably wouldn't be ideal. Mind you 5 Arrowstorms would be amusing. :p<br><br><b>Knight<\/b> - Solid takes damage and deal it quite well, never deals as much as the Archer\/Sorc or Priest though, and even the Paladin can be more damaging once she has Godsend.<br><br><b>Rogue<\/b> - Pretty essential for lockpicking, assassinating and later stunning. Wouldn't take two.<br><br><b>Priest<\/b> - Probably my favourite, by the mid game. Turns into the highest damage dealer once level 5 spells are reached. I'd suggest two of these instead of a Paladin. Only one gets the cross of course, still would be decent.<br><br><b>Sorceress<\/b> - Great character, and two of these would be amazing, again instead of the Paladin. Two lots of Prison spells would be insane, amazing damage dealing too.<br><br><b>Gnome<\/b> - Once you've hit level 15\/16 all your stats are maxed bar Intelligence\/Spirit which are a waste of points. I would probably not use a Gnome again especially if there's any chance of importing characters into Sovereign.<br><br>The other races didn't really stand out, so pick the ones you like.<br><br><b>Runes<\/b> - Early game these were plentiful, then mid game they got low, late game I got crazy amounts, ending with about 2k spare!<br><br><b>Holy Water<\/b> - I mentioned this last time I played but it's still too micromangery to me, having to remember to cast holy water before resting and such, I'd prefer them to regain to full when resting in the inn at least. Could the Priest get an expanded limit later in the game perhaps? 40 is pretty miserly when the Sorceress can carry 2k+ worth of runes!  :shock: <br><br><b>Bugs<\/b> - I came across several bugs as I went along all of which I reported on the forums and they were fixed usually within days or even hours of reporting! Charles is really on the ball!<br><br><b>Improvements<\/b> <br><br>The aforementioned difficulty setting would be nice for veterans, the game really is much easier than it used to be.<br><br>Space out the abilities slightly more, having little after level 10 was disappointing. or consider adding the odd extra thing in. Maybe a Paladin can eventually hold a 2 handed weapon and shield? The Priest can have more Holy Water etc.<br><br>Strafing - Please add this, would be nice!<br><br><b>Final Thoughts<\/b> - All in all I really enjoyed playing through the game again even if it was a little easy this time, and will definitely play Sovereign once it's released, and in fact I'd be more than happy to help playtest Sovereign if you like Charles? I'm good at spotting bugs. ;) If you like playing classic RPG's then give this a go! :)<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Daniel.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20192066', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20192066' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20192066\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20192066' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20192066\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20192066', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20192066_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20192066_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19736115\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mediocrepoet\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"18337422\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a421184a00bca41fdf02a487793187415624415a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a421184a00bca41fdf02a487793187415624415a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a421184a00bca41fdf02a487793187415624415a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mediocrepoet\/\" data-miniprofile=\"18337422\">mediocrepoet<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mediocrepoet\/games\/?tab=all\">418 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mediocrepoet\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mediocrepoet\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">18.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game has been a long time in the making. A sort of tribute to the early Might and Magic series and similar games. I've quite enjoyed it throughout different releases and it's true that this newest one is more difficult than earlier versions. But it's still manageable, just like the older games were. Early on, you'll have to be more cautious and should err on the side of saving often since it's not an easy game, but once you have a level or two under your belt, things become a lot more manageable. <br><br>If you aren't familiar with it, this is a turn-based RPG with a six member party that can be created (or you can use the pre-generated party) from choices of six classes and four races. Character creation is fairly straightforward with class abilities and spells being learned at pre-determined levels, though at each level up and during creation, you allocate a few points between your various attributes (e.g. strength, intelligence, etc.). The spells are a mixture between combat oriented magic and more utility oriented magic (such as casting a spell to escape a dungeon quickly). <br><br>You also have to manage your resources such as food, water and magical runes, so you can't rest indefinitely without returning to town to resupply and you need to be at least somewhat aware of how many magical resources you have for spellcasting. In practice, magical runes are mostly a limitation in the early game, but I suppose if your playstyle is more magic intensive than mine, it might be something you have to monitor more actively. Similarly, like in many older games, your gear starts out quite meager and you have to build up to equipment that is decent and eventually, great. <br><br>If you enjoy exploration based games and miss the sort of experience from older, more challenging games (or find the games you play these days too easy), you should give Swords and Sorcery: Underworld a try. I bought it at nearly double the Steam price a few years ago and thought it was well worth it then, it's a steal now. There's also a sequel in the works to look out for if you find this style of game appealing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19736115', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19736115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19736115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19736115' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19736115\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19736115', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19736115_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19736115_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24651790\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"38752472\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f7\/f7b6b9b6ec0898d936628aed176cc6861218c9a9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f7\/f7b6b9b6ec0898d936628aed176cc6861218c9a9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f7\/f7b6b9b6ec0898d936628aed176cc6861218c9a9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/\" data-miniprofile=\"38752472\">Lord Azlan<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/games\/?tab=all\">491 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197999018200\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI played Bards Tale in 1985. Lovely game.<br><br>99 Barbarians. Only being able to save in the Adventures Guild. The eerie music from the temples.<br><br>Brian The Fist. El Cid. A bard that needs to take a swig of his wineskin before playing some musical tunes. Four mage classes. A mad monk that fights with only his hands and feet. <br><br>I could go on. A masterpiece. Played it again for 60 hours a few years ago when the original games were included in the later and mostly useless comedic Bards Tale remake.<br><br>Between 1985 and this day I have always asked why no developers have wanted to create something like that. Where are the mainstream Bards Tale games?<br><br>So huge, HUGE credit to OlderBytes for not only asking the question but for putting their money in and developing this gem.<br><br>A dungeon crawler, turn based combat. Grid based movement. Locked doors. Treasure. Healing. Items.<br><br>Experience points. Exploring.<br><br>Exploration is one of the game's best points. You would think that map design on a grid is pretty easy. But I can tell you about some awful, awful games where the maps were obscene or even \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The maps in this game feel really well thought out. They really made me want to explore every nook and crook and are quite varied. <br><br>I reckon the game developer must be a proper gamer himself as in every town I visited, the place I wanted to visit first was the last place I found. Last place - each time. Diabolical game design or bad damn luck for me? I am talking about the shop or that one time I needed food. Where the heck are they?<br><br>The games graphics are very competent and unusual. Encounters can be interesting as the bestiary is quite varied. The game is smarter than it looks.  Old school game play has been upgraded in some ways, such as requirements to plan ahead and create holy water for your priest. My Thief had a Stun option. I loved my thief as once hiding in the shadows he could one shot kill some nasties. He was also able to find daggers that had extra assassin damage - lovely. I can't imagine having a party without a priest as healing in the midst of battle was crucial to my experience. <br><br>Undead. More of those folks than in an episode of The Walking Dead. Another thing new to the genre is that my party had to be &quot;Blessed&quot; before they could apply any damage to the foul creatures. I even came across a lava\/ fire area I could not traverse until I remembered I had a &quot;levitate&quot; spell. Cool.<br><br>The combat itself is quite interesting and requires full concentration as it is easy to get whacked if you assume spamming Attack will get you through. Combat is almost like little puzzles where you need to figure out who to go forward, who to heal, who to drop out of melee. There is even one option that allows one party member to protect another. My priest has a spell that allows her to read minds in combat which then builds up your Bestiary. At this point, I can't be sure whether this is useful in game or useful building a Steam Achievement. Still interesting reading the text.<br><br>It's not all hugs and kisses though. Just one thing.<br><br>One shot kills. Save scumming. I hate it and this game positively encourages it.<br><br>I would really love to know how many fights other gamers can go before saving. Really. What is the record so far?<br><br>It breaks the immersion of what could be a fantastic game. Behind every nook and cranny there is an encounter that can wipe out your whole party and kill you stone dead. No notice. No warning. Return to &quot;GO&quot;. Behind every nook and cranny and even in nooks you have even visited before. It's the random encounter generator or level list or something. <br><br>Something that can really spoil the flow of the game. It stops me from giving this a &quot;I love this game&quot; to &quot;I recommend you try this game&quot;.<br><br>I will ponder on this final criticism of the game for now as I would like try it out for more.<br><br>Other thoughts? <br><br>Loot. Would be nice if some encounters left behind food or water. <br>Scrolls that can raise the dead if your party finishes an encounter a few men short.<br>Encounters that leave behind food you can eat and heal yourself.<br>Cough - some directions in town?<br>Some unique save locations instead of save anywhere - would help immersion.<br>Better armour\/ equipment\/ spells of mages. Those guys just die all the time.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24651790', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24651790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24651790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24651790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24651790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24651790', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24651790_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24651790_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19772220\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053709888\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93444160\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/853770d518185dd6b7593614396060ef296aa291.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/853770d518185dd6b7593614396060ef296aa291.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/853770d518185dd6b7593614396060ef296aa291_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053709888\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93444160\">wallace8766<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053709888\/games\/?tab=all\">26 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053709888\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053709888\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">32.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat game if you are a gridder fan.

It's a little rough around the edges sometimes, don't expect AAA dungeon textures, but it's got charm and that crucial feel of exploring a dangerous area where every step counts. If you played any of the recent crop of grid-based dungeon romps like the Grimrocks and wished they had turn based combat, get this game. If you like the Etrian Odyssey series or Dark Spire on the DS, get this game. If you liked the more recent Elminage Gothic or M&amp;MX, get this game.<br><br>Look past the textures and the lack of flashy animations and there's a great game with challenging and varied turn based combat here. Very glad I bought it and I've already got more enjoyment out of it than a lot of AAA games released recently.<br><br>A couple of tips- save OFTEN early on and make sure to (D)rop your squishies out of melee range if they start combat in it.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19753084', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19753084' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19753084\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19753084' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19753084\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19753084', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19753084_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19753084_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19726456\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/summitus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"10051965\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/0474a7c6b589e132a8f7a355200fd513dcb74b8f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/0474a7c6b589e132a8f7a355200fd513dcb74b8f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/04\/0474a7c6b589e132a8f7a355200fd513dcb74b8f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/summitus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10051965\">Andypandy R<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/summitus\/games\/?tab=all\">1,297 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/summitus\/recommended\/\">24 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/summitus\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat old school crpg experience,  quite tough,but really satisfying and rewarding when you make some progress and become more skilled with your party management.<br>I could write a wall of text about this game but there are others who can do that much more eloquently than I. <br>Developers like these guys deserve our support, its obvious that they care about their  game and are activlely engaged with their community.

If this is unfamiliar, then read on to see if this game may be a good fit for you.<br><br>Warning: The game is untraditionally balanced and is not for everyone. If you go in with modern RPG expectations and are unwilling or unable to adapt, you will be disappointed and\/or frustrated with this game. This game will slap this expectation in the face in the first couple encounters. You can reduce the probability of luck playing a role in your victories by grinding some, but this game presents many tools in combat and many encounters are like tactical puzzles that you'll need to solve before you can survive consistently.<br><br>I'm still playing through this game and am deeply appreciative of the developer's responsiveness and taking into consideration suggestions and tweaks. I look forward to future products that they produce.<br><br>Noting points, whether they are pluses for some, minuses for others or neutrals.<br><br>Controls:<br>* Use a full-sized keyboard and mouse to control the game with nearly every option accessible by a key alone<br>* Keybindings cannot be reassigned at this time, so a mouse is strongly recommended if you do not have a full-sized keyboard with number pad for the NumPad Plus or NumPad Minus to adjust attributes at creation and level ups<br>* If you're using a gamepad emulator such as Pinnacle Game Profiler or Xpadder, I would recommend assigning to WASD (or QZSD) for movement and mouse controls at a minimum ~ other options such as Escape, Enter, as well as the letters A through D may be convenient as well<br>* There does not seem to be a strafe option at this time, but can get through without it<br><br>Gameplay:<br>* Create up to twelve adventurers, deploy six party members at a time including one that looks kind of like an Arnold-style Conan<br>* Choose from one of six classes (knight, paladin, archer, thief, priest, sorceror) with one of four races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome), one of four face portraits per race and gender combo and assign attribute points among seven attributes<br>* Level ups have random health and spell point gains based on influencing stat, allow for three attribute points to be assigned, and award new skills or spells depending on the class<br>* Options to quick save and load in most locations on most screens<br>* Navigate first-person through dungeons, moving one square on the map grid a time, engaging in combat and dialogue, managing party and inventory<br>* Combat options allow for moving party members into or out of melee range individually or all at once, waiting or protecting allies, using melee or ranged attacks, using spells, fleeing, using other abilities and possible others that I'm forgetting - to succeed in this game, it is strongly recommend to take advantage of as many of these options as possible while adapting to enemy tactics<br>* Combat is turn-based with each character taking a turn per round with the ability to postpone their turn toward the end of the round<br>* At least 50 save slots in-game, if not more<br>* Sound effects match most actions<br>* The music has been intermittent in my game, such as a discovery scene, quest reward scene or the sound of a battle that just turned grim<br>* Occasional game crashes and bugs, but the developer has been communicating regularly with the community and addressing these issues<br><br>Aspects that I enjoyed\/opinionated in addition to the above points:<br>* Enjoyable art style with realistic art for most portraits and strong contrast on most other aspects that may have a comic-book feel for some<br><br>Untraditional Balance and Modern RPG Expectations Expounded:<br>* The beginning area is a tutorial area with shockingly high damage values, however, once you adapt to the mechanics, you may be able to easily run through this beginning area without any deaths or the need to save (though saving is recommended in case of an unexpected crash) -- armor does make a difference, but most importantly, positioning can prevent enemies from attacking altogether<br>* Dipping your toes into the next area can lead to brutal defeats and force you to scrounge for all your options to counter fear, counter silence on your casters, denying archers clean shots to your healer, changing your leader to a faster character to order people into a safer position or sometimes going as far as leveling a new party member to counter situations in those areas<br>* Sorcerors in most fantasy games have easy access to ranged attack spells - this is not initially true and sorcerors may fare better in melee range until you have more runes or until you're a higher level where you do have those rune-free ranged attack spells<br>* Initial combat positioning is not static and misreading a situation can and will get you killed - do not assume that your character in the bottom portraits is out of melee range, double check their movement choices and portrait for cues<br><br>ESRBish\/Content Advisory:<br>* Mostly nude outline of a spirit woman with no nipples and some enemies in busty garments<br>* Some art with female cleavage -

Also, the ability to connect with developers of indie games is something that was never able to be done with consoles, it makes the player feel much more involved in the game world. Swords and Socery-Underworld is a perfect example of an &quot;underground&quot; role playing game. Big game studios do not make their money developing games highly inspired from antiquated RPG's of the past like &quot;A Bard's Tale&quot; and &quot;Might and Magic IV&quot;. Some newer titles have done well such as the Grimrock series, but those will never ascend to the likes of what the big developers are doing. For those of us who still enjoy the old style of gaming, who don't care about flashy graphics and sound, and just wan't an atmospheric, immersive story and all the fantasy trademarks of yesteryear will do well to check out this game. It's refreshing to download a 256 mb game and be able to fire it up within seconds instead of waiting for hours for a download to finish. A lot of the gaming elements are familiar to aforementioned games in this review, but there is still a learning curve, even for us older games. I truly enjoy the map layout and how the world map is connected more like puzzle pieces, instead of just being able to see your entire map at once. You want to keep exploring the grid based world until every square is uncovered, in hopes you'll come across an elusive rare item or challening foe. I'm about 10 hours into the game and have uncovered the first four segments of the map. I have no idea how big the world is, and that's the beauty of it...to keep exploring and see where it leads next. I highly recommend this game, but only to people with patience and who can appreciate the old days of gaming through and through.

I recommand it to anyone who wants to know a little bit how we felt when we played for the first time Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master two decades ago.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26348904', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26348904' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26348904\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26348904' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26348904\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26348904', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26348904_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26348904_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24810915\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043165000\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"82899272\">Almalric Elerian<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 141.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just finished the game last night.

You slay monster, grind xp, level up your heroes and distribute Apoints into attributes like strength, endurance, accuracy, speed, intelligence, wisdom and luck. Str determines your melee damage, endurance your hp gains per level, accuracy your overall hitchance and ranged damage, speed your turn in a combat round, intelligence your Mana and spelldamage, wisdom your mana and kleric spell damage\/healing, luck gives you boosts for your damage, hp &amp; manapoints gain for levelup.<br><br>The classes are Knight, Paladin, Archer, Thief, Cleric and Sorcerer are available in SaSU. You can make your own heroes at the start of the game.<br><br>You explore the dungeon, cities, landscape in a 3d firstperson view, you can control your party of 6 adventurers per WASD or arrowkeys.<br><br>There is a main quest and several uncomplicated sidequests to do.<br><br>The difficulty is rather tough in the beginnig, your heroes start the adventure naked with walking sticks as weapons. Save early, save often.<br><br>If you liked the old Might &amp; Magic games Sword and Sorcery Underworld can be a nice nostalgic trip. <br><br>The graphics are quite nice, it looks better then the old DOS Dungeon crawlers. The UI works quite well. The game is not comparable to state of the art computer games. Do not expect a Might and Magic X quality or Legend of Grimrock quality or gameplay. I like the game for the tough difficulty and oldschool feel. The balancing feels a bit off sometimes, monsters seem to bee overpowered in the beginning and die like flies when you got a little more powerful. In the next area the new monsters hit you like a truck again. <br><br>I would recommend Sword and Sorcery - Underworld for RPG enthusiasts and turnbased dungeoncrawler fans.<br><br>Have a nice day<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23693817', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23693817' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short23693817\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23693817' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short23693817\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23693817', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23693817_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short23693817_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short20633353\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198009506875\/recommended\/408400\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"49241147\">Roscoetoo<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 59.8 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCoolest game in a while.
