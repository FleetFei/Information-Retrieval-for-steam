the game is a tad shorter than Lords of Shadow 1 but it is longer that Mirror of Fate.<br>2 - this game is easier than LoS 1 and MoF, but the last boss is such a pain..<br>3 - not many puzzles, if any it will be a kid's puzzle.<br>4 - story is weaker than LoS 1 but somewhat alot better than MoF.<br>5 - the modern city is not very interesting.<br><br>now the positive part:<br><br>1 - graphics are very very good.<br>2 - combat system is simplified and it is more useful than LoS 1, no longer you have combos that are useless in combat.<br>3 - great story, still not as good as LoS 1. meaningful and relevant to the previous installments (LoS1 and MoF)<br>4 - no crashings, no freezings and no technical issues what so ever.<br>5 - amazing design of the Dracula's castle.<br>6 - Great soundtrack and voice acting, still i think LoS 1 was a bit better.<br>7 - rotateable camera angle in-game, which was somewhat painful in LoS 1.<br>8 - so many secrets and playablitiy, just like LoS 1 and even better than that.<br>9 - great boss fights and boss designs.<br>10 - state of the art character design, level design, theme, atmosphere and off course bosses.<br><br>frankly i dont get why on earth metacritic gave this game a 58 out of 100.<br>if i would to give LoS 1 98\/100, then i would give this game at least 85\/100.<br><br>i strongly recommend this game to you, defo worth the price and time.<br>do not look at the metacritic score, it is an amazing game.<br><br>i hope my review was useful to you guys, all the best and enjoy this astonshing game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12702190', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12702190' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12702190\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12702190' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12702190\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12702190', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12702190_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12702190_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t523 of 675 people (77%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">42 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9264897\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"34626792\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/193519ad83c9c114b22fb0e8ad4e295f12b65ccd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/193519ad83c9c114b22fb0e8ad4e295f12b65ccd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/193519ad83c9c114b22fb0e8ad4e295f12b65ccd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/\" data-miniprofile=\"34626792\">Heavy Mettle<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/games\/?tab=all\">417 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/recommended\/\">9 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/heavy-mettle\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 25, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Don't bother suffering the reviews by critics and gamers alike who have written this title off because of their views of the first game.<\/b><br><br>Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is easily in the running for my 2014 game of the year. You've undoubtedly seen the low reviews from people who claimed poor graphics. These claims are groundless, and trampled by some of the screenshots you can uncover in the community hub for this game. The graphics are staggeringly good, and some areas have such incredible photorealism that you have to look twice just to make sure you're looking at a texture.<br><br>The free-form camera works great. No longer can whiners throw a fit that they can't see elements of the battle, as you can now rotate 360 degrees in virtually every setting. It not only grants you a breathtaking view of the scenery; it allows you to tactically view your surroundings and analyze your best moves mid-combat.<br><br>Platforming and quick-time events have been significantly altered to combat the same list of complainers who hated them in the first game. Platforming now directly shows you where to go, and no longer forces you into long-winded movements where every step is a new jump. You now streamline climb like spider-man over most surfaces, and the ones too far grant you a swift, and simple jump to the new object. Quick-time events have been cut in quarters. No more cinematic sequences where defending yourself during a movie becomes normal. They're limited to combat, and the rare gameplay-to-cinema segue.<br><br>Controls are as easy as they were in the first game, with a few minor improvements. Button rotations have made combat noticeably smoother, and grant the player less hectic moments of desperate survival. Moves now have instant-cancellations, (another complaint from the first game) which allow the player the freedom to be as quick and reflexive as they want to be. If you die in combat-- you're just not up to snuff that round. No more blaming the devs.<br><br>The music. What can I say? I've never been so excited to tear into a new game just to hear the musical composition behind it. Oscar Araujo does it again with a score so moving and epic that it pulls players back into its immersive world of magic and demons with a slew of trumpet blasts and harmony-driven pieces that are sure to win over even the most jaded action-gamers.<br><br>There's never been a better time to jump into the world of Castlevania. I loved this game's predecessor, and I can still hold firmly to my nostalgic love of a classic Castlevania devoid of all the work MercurySteam has pumped into it in recent years.<br><br>However, the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series has brought life into a franchise that has desperately needed fresh-blood (forgive the pun).<br><br>I strongly urge anyone to pick up this title, even if you're only looking for a new action-game. The battles are challenging; you'll be forced to reconsider how you take on countless enemies that you think you know well enough from the first game.<br><br>The story is moving. Piecing together questions and answers from both the first game as well as Mirror of Fate, LoS 2 brings about a conclusion that is sure to yield an uproar from the masses for more of this tale.<br><br>You are no longer a pure-hearted man. Gabriel has become a ruthless, violence-embracing monster who is indifferent to suffering and who will stop at nothing to obtain the freedom he desires. Many of his choices in the game will makes fans of the holy-hero cringe as he shows how his transformation into the Prince of Darkness has affected his moral judgment.<br><br>This game is worth your money, and it's worth your time. If this game stretches even HALF the length of the first game, then it's going to be a ride you'll never forget.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('9264897', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '9264897' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary9264897\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '9264897' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary9264897\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '9264897', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9264897_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary9264897_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t151 of 179 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">10 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary9372413\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"24126011\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2b5285049b0884e18f09bd8c65c25dc30d836d61_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24126011\">[AReV]Nomed<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/games\/?tab=all\">1,057 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/\">32 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nomedemon\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 continues the story of Gabriel Belmont and his transformation into the dark lord; Dracula.<br><br>Upon starting the game you'll immediately be plunged into an epic battle as Dracula's castle is besieged by the Brotherhood of Light. During this time you'll be trained in the art of combat, mastering Dracula's three weapons as well as evasive maneuvers. The weapons vary and each of them fill a specialized role. <br><br>After the initial opening, you'll be unleashed into an open world with two dimensions to travel between, Dracula's Castle and a modern Gothic city built upon its ruins. The art direction and audio is phenomenal, featuring an amazing cast of voice actors; Robert Carlyle, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Jason Isaacs to name a few. The soundtrack is also really well done, fitting the mood of the game flawlessly. The environments are absolutely beautiful, allowing plenty of room for exploration while searching for the various upgrades, lore and abilities.<br><br>The story, when combined with the previous two entries is engaging and helps propel you through the 15 hour game, although the ending is a bit abrupt as well as disappointing. Veterans of the Hack n' Slash genre will want to begin on the harder difficulty as it's a bit simple when compared to games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Between, fighting, exploring, puzzle solving, and platforming there's a lot of fun to be had.<br><br>While the stealth segments seem to be a major complaint for a lot of reviewers, they don\u2019t detract from the overall game. I\u2019ll admit that I was skeptical at first since stealth really has no business being in a Castlevania title, but they play out similarly to puzzles opposed to traditional stealth missions. They\u2019re also few and far between.<br><br>The menu system is highly polished and will document every type of creature you fight against. It also acts to manage your upgrades and abilities as you level. Plenty of Lore and backstory is provided along the way from diaries as well.<br><br>While it'd be nice to have a triple A classic Symphony of the Night experience, LoS2 is great in its own way and playing as \u201cThe Dragon\u201d with this new take on the legend is a blast. Don\u2019t believe some of the critics, Lords of Shadow 2 is a must-play.<br><br>For a longer and more detailed review, here\u2019s a video my friend and I put together:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\"

between a diamond in the rough and problematic technical or some other aspect of the game, but with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 it's somewhat different. Time to see if I can put into somewhat coherent paragraph or two as to why that's the case.<br><br>Let's start off by saying I was one of the people who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow for what it was \u2013 not necessarily a creatively original masterpiece, but a game of astounding production values, competent writing and tight narrative punctuated by stellar voice work and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was a very meaty game which lead to some even saying it was too long for its own good. Fast forward to sequel and you can see it basically falters in each of these categories.<br><br>Interestingly enough game seems to swing between two polar opposites with its visuals because on one hand you have this classic Castlevania look comprised of foreboding yet mystical gothic castle to romp through, as well as its assorted menagerie of beasties to but heads with and solve painfully few puzzles compared to the first game, but on the other you have to contend with extremely bland modern-day warehouses and science laboratories ad nauseam alongside some fairly uninspired enemies ranging from more classical demons and Satanists to, what really should've been more interesting that ended up, futuristic soldiers and cybernetic abominations roaming the streets. But honestly, it's this weird disjointed narrative that undoes the game the most in my mind because you can clearly tell there was meant to be more there instead of just going from A to B and meandering in-between retreading locations with nothing but brief radio contacts from time to time. And lastly \u2013 game is simply short compared to the first one and that probably ties into my previous point. Rumors abound regarding game's troubled development were apparently well founded. <br><br>That's not to say game is bad because, as you will have most likely noticed despite my continued rambling on regarding its negatives, this is marked as a positive review overall. It's still Lords of Shadow and if you liked the original you'll probably like this considering you can overlook its weak story. Gameplay feels familiar and skippable QTEs are god-sent, both of which are points in game's favor for me, not to mention combat and item system was expanded and enemy variety despite their designs actually means you'll end up facing quite a bit of different behaviors. Story establishes the mood very early on as one of Dracula's somber and more resigned journey, one profoundly personal despite all other events that unfold over the course of the game. Had it been properly fleshed out and Robert Carlyle's more subdued performance given time to develop, occasional hamfisted melodrama notwithstanding, it would've been a much, much better final product. I also heard some nay saying about mandatory stealth sections in the game to which I say it's about time to drop hand-holding. Barring for one section involving leaves and crazed Satyr these were a welcome diversion for me and fitting considering MC's condition story-wise.<br><br>One last caveat I feel should be posted is that playing the original game and Mirror of Fate is recommended before tackling the sequel.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17266376', 'summary' );

With Lords of Shadow 2, Mecury Steam is drawing their controversial take on the franchise to a close, putting players in the worn out boots of Dracula himself as he faces off against Satan and his army of minions. Attempting to inject a bit of metroidvania design and hopping back and forth between Dracula's castle and modern times, is this the compromise between the side scrolling titles and the foundation laid by Lords of Shadow?<br>\t<br>After a recap of the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, players are treated to an epic prologue that has Dracula defending his less than humble abode from a tremendous siege which culminates in an encounter with his son, Alucard.  The game then flashes forward a thousand years to find a very weak Dracula awakening in a cathedral in modern times greeted by Zobek. Zobek offers Dracula the chance to end his cursed existence in exchange for the death's of Satan's acolytes. In typical video game fashion, Dracula must regain his lost powers and battle a few inner demons in addition to Satan's minions. While the sections that have Dracula revisiting his castle provide some appreciative depth and introspection, the plot unfolding in modern times is rather underwhelming and even a bit silly. The game is at it's narrative peak when it recaptures the spirit of Gabirel's sober journey in the first game, reflecting on Dracula's numerous sins and the decimation of the Belmont family. <br>\t<br>Perhaps the largest change to Lords of Shadow 2 comes in it's structure. Dracula moves between present day and his castle and, eventually, players can revisit areas previously explored. It makes the game more metroidvania-like thank it's predecessor but hoping back and forth between the two areas leaves the geography feeling fragmented and backtracking only becomes available much later in the game making this still feel somewhat like a linear level based affair. Combat remains largely intact from the previous games with light and dark magic now complimented by two additional weapons: the chaos claws and the void sword. These along with Dracula's shadow whip can be upgraded by purchasing various moves and utilizing them. It's a system that rewards using your entire move set and is an excellent addition to a genre where many rely on a couple effective all purpose combos. Relics have been added as consumable items that give Dracula the ability to restore his health, transform into a dragon for massive damage and gain extra experience.<br>\t<br>Tragically, the gameplay does take a major step back when it comes to the puzzles. Standing in for the first game's brain teasers are a gauntlet of stealth bits that have Dracula posessing enemies, cowering in the shadows and transforming into a rat in order to navigate small cracks and crevices. Most of these are easy and don't feel rewarding in addition to being at odds with playing as a powerful and feared vampire. A couple of the stealth sections can prove to be frustrating and one visit to a forum exposes one pre-boss fight stealth section as a stopping point for many. Boss fights are also completely unchallenging which is a shame since Lords of Shadow provided an excellent difficulty balance.  Fortunately, those who invest in the DLC will be treated to gameplay and puzzles that are more in line with the original Lords of Shadow making it an excellent piece of content for fans even though it's narrative additions are minimal.<br>\t<br>On the PC, Lords of Shadow 2's beautiful art direction is showcased by higher resolution textures and runs silky smooth at 60fps. Despite the fact that it doesn't offer the lastest graphical bells and whistles, this Direct X 9 title is more than pleasing to look and all of it's details can be appreciated since the fixed camera of the first game has been ditched. The Castle in particular is a stunning place to be and it becomes almost frustrating that the entire game doesn't take place there since the modern city seems a bit bland in comparison. Enemies can also be a bit bland and repetative but the bosses generally make up for this minor short fall. The soundtrack to Lords of Shadow 2 is also magnificent with beautiful somber orchestral compositions and delicate piano pieces. It adds a huge amount of ambiance to the game and is perhaps this year's best soundtrack.<br>\t<br>Lords of Shadow 2 is unequivocally not as good on the whole as it's predecessor though it shows a few major improvements that are easy to appreciate. It's a lengthy experience that offers superb combat, excellent visuals and a top notch soundtrack. For a Castlevania fan, it generally outweighs the lame stealth segments, repetitive enemies and underwhelming open world design. Even for it's biggest detractors, the Lords of Shadows games are proof that Castlevania can exist in three dimensions.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12047511', 'summary' );

presentation: <\/i><br><br>+ Sinister depiction of the game world with dystopian elements.<br>+ Each stage has its own atmosphere and iconic art style of the Castlevania series. <br>+ Obsessive attention to detail regarding level design. <br>+ Extensive concept art section with hundreds of pictures and sketches. <br><br>o Solid sound effects. <br>o Due to the console based origin a gamepad is recommended, in order to play the game.   <br><br><i> Combat &amp; gameplay: <\/i><br><br>+ Combat system is solid and reliable. <br>+ Good camera handling in combat and exploration sections.<br>+ Exploration of the surroundings is rewarded with bonus powers and useful trinkets.<br><br>o Variety of enemies is rather small and champions are too weak. <br><br>- The stealth sections are an atrocity. An insult to the legendary abilities of the Lord of Shadows. <br><br><i> Characters &amp; story: <\/i><br><br>+ Certain characters and story elements from Lords of Shadow and Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate are reintroduced and further developed. <br>+ The downloadable content \u201cRevelations\u201d introduces Alucard as a playable character and provides some surprising background information.<br><br>o Compelling storytelling in the beginning, but it loses momentum towards the end.    <br><br>- Inconsistent character development of Dracula.<br>- The final boss is a clich\u00e9. <br><br><i> Summary: <\/i><br><br>The second instalment of the Lords of Shadow series offers beautiful visuals and a solid combat system. However, the rest of the game does not reach the level of quality of its predecessor. Despite the strong start it loses its momentum in the middle of the game, and the solution of the conflict between Dracula and his antagonist can be considered a clich\u00e9. To add insult to injury, the forced stealth sections are an unnecessary and partially frustrating element. <br><br><i> Achievements: <\/i><br><br>Estimated time for 100 % completion: +40 hours<br><br>Singleplayer achievements: 56<br>Multiplayer achievements: none\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23533252', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23533252' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23533252\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23533252' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23533252\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23533252', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23533252_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23533252_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">3 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11886323\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"23886646\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8c6749748ead0d9d4e9150249cd634609a93af86.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8c6749748ead0d9d4e9150249cd634609a93af86.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8c\/8c6749748ead0d9d4e9150249cd634609a93af86_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/\" data-miniprofile=\"23886646\">Parsnip<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/games\/?tab=all\">1,790 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/majorparsnip\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">34.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 27, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, I actually liked it a lot more than I expected. The overall impression of it everywhere seemed to be very negative (regardless of what you think about metacritic, 58\/100 doesn't exactly inspire confidence), but I ended up liking it quite a bit.<br><br>The combat is fun, even though it sometimes feel like the enemies have too many unblockacle moves, so instead of sync blocking you are dodging maybe more than I would prefer. Still, Dracula is nimble and there are enough new moves doled out every now and then to keep things interesting all the way through. Void and Chaos powers replace the light and dark magic from the first game, but more in name than function. You still get orbs from keeping your combat focus going, in order to fill out those magic meters, and one of them is more powerful and the other one is less, but heals with every hit landed. It's essentially the same system as the first LoS, but some very minor differences. Probably the biggest difference with combat is not even directly related to combat, but it's the free camera. And they handle it well, the combat camera is smart most of the time (unlike say, the camera in MGRR), and doesn't get in the way. All the finishers take too long though, I get it, you are Dracula, but suck that blood a little faster, thanks. But overall, good stuff.<br><br>Presentation is probably the most uneven thing in the entire package. Environments and locations can be gorgeous, but they can also be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing boring. Boring sewers and industrial plants, but also gorgeous gothic (or something) architecture and fantastic vistas. Dracula seems incredibly tiny in this world too. The grand scale of everything works well in the non-industrial setting, big majectic doors and windows etc, but in the industrial setting it just looks comical. Music is the same, Araujo does some good work with some tracks, but others are just a big meeh. I remember reading an interview from him where he says that he didn't really have a lot of freedom in the end, that he had tried to approach the music from other angles but was told that it needed to be more cinematic. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. The story is really really dumb, somewhat poorly written, but it does its job of pushing you towards your next objective.<br><br>The worst part are the sections where they probably thought that they should add some variety in the gameplay design or something. Obviously the much talked stealth stuff is one part of that. They have absolutely no place in this game, they are just poor. But they are also really easy and short, so I'm not sure how the press was so badly hung up on them. Yes, they suck \u2665\u2665\u2665, but it takes like 2 minutes to go through. The elevator action section is dumb as well, again, not because it's hard or anything, but a timed switch to restore power in order to use an elevator is not fun. And I imagine the director had played Uncharted and told that we need something like that, heart pounding set pieces. The results are absolute \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. There's one section where the floor falls under you, push forward and push A for awesome. The entire train section is hot garbage, but especially the part where you dodge the roof lights or whatever. And then there's the QTE's, which you can turn off from the settings. If you played LoS, you'll probably remember that most boss fights had some easy quicktime event sequences in them, sometimes in the middle or in the end, and usually if you failed the boss would gain a little health back, rinse and repeat until you were quick and timely enough. That's still here, but if you turn them off, it will just play that whole section as if you were successful. And I very much recommend it. What does it tell you about this hot feature that they added an option to just disable them?<br><br>The game is very linear, but it has a hint of that non-linearity with all the secrets you can find. That speaks to me in some primal level and I can just get lost in the world, just running around and looking behind every corner and such to find everything. It just speaks to me man. Of course I would recommend you do this only after you get all your powers back, can't get them all without all your powers. There's also some combat challenges, and I played through couple tiers of them... but didn't bother with the rest. It gets into a little more complicated stuff than I have patience for (you can only hit this dude while he is frozen, while simultaneously killing smaller dudes every 20 seconds etc etc). For me it takes the fun out of it.<br><br>So overall, I'd say my experience with the game is positive. I paid ~20$ for it and I'd say it's worth at least that if not more.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11886323', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11886323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11886323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11886323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11886323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11886323', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11886323_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11886323_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/connorjweaver\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21166790\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/connorjweaver\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"160382433\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccf13911c8dfb60f1b913c1c4d36b324d82d0216.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccf13911c8dfb60f1b913c1c4d36b324d82d0216.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cc\/ccf13911c8dfb60f1b913c1c4d36b324d82d0216_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/connorjweaver\/\" data-miniprofile=\"160382433\">Connor J.

And most of them call it inferior to the series or just simply say it's mediocre. This game made me to stop listening to these reviewers. I didn't really want to buy it, but I fell in love so hard with the story they presented in LoS1 and MoF I needed to know the conclusion and I felt like I wouldn't be satisfied if I just simply watched it on YouTube. So here I am amazed by this fantastic game...<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Combat<\/div>If you are coming from LoS1 (if not then please play it before this one) you already know the basics. They basically tightened it up, made it much more responsive and fluid then it was. There are new moves and combos, too. And this time we get a much more &quot;user-friendly&quot; skill page then in LoS1.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Story and narrative<\/div>These were the second biggest positives I encountered in this game (the 1st one is ofc the combat). Of course there are plot twists, and most of them hit hard (you know it's good when your jaw drops). There are many interesting characters; there will be some who you'll hate and many who you'll love. It made me care about a side-character in ~20 mins and when it turned out he may die I felt really bad. But the ultimate peak for me was the Toymaker. It is that kind of rare time in gaming when a good story and a well-imagined narrative meets. I won't spoil it for you, you have to experience it by yourself. And most importantly it got rid of that bad narrative element that they used in the 1st game, which made up every little thing so dramatic that it felt like it just changed the whole world, but in reality it had no impact on anything.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Camera<\/div>Thankfully they got rid of the fixed camera presented in the first game. Don't get me wrong, fixed camera can work pretty well (like the old Resident Evils), but a high-speed action came certainly doesn't need it. Surprisingly it's also dynamic. So like when you're just walking, it comes quite close to you (kind of like RE4). But during combat it goes much further so you can see better.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Platforming<\/div>Just like the combat, they kept it and made it better. Thanks to the accurate controls it's much more fluid and if you failed a lot of times during platforming in LoS1 (like me) than fear no more, it's much better. A little bat swarm will always indicate where you can jump to and during climbing you can (optionally) highlight where you can climb to.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Soundtrack<\/div>I know it's subjective, but it's still amazing. It's not that kind of music that you will download and listen to regularly. It just fits so well the game, that it greatly boosts its already good atmosphere. It's epic and beautiful at the same time. And when it needs to be, then it's emotional.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Bosses<\/div>They are pretty diverse and just enough challanging.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+Design<\/div>The graphics are good, but the design is the thing that's important. When you're in the castle dimension it's simply breathtaking. Every little detail in every little painting and statue and thing in the castle...Everything feels just in place, that I risk that even in 8-bit it would still look beautiful. Now about the modern dimension...For a city design it looks good, but I couldn't wait to get back into the castle from the modern world.<br><br>And the list could go on and on (good portray of Dracula, references, etc.), but let's talk about some not that good aspects of the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">+\/-Stealth segments<\/div>Now this is the most criticized part...I don't hate them but neither love them. It's all about if you mind being taken away from the fast-paced gameplay and use your brain and patience a little bit. But the biggest issue with these is the fact that mostly there's only one way to do them! But people hate it like it's all over the place but you have to be stealthy like 5 times in this game...But I loved the parts when I could be a rat, it still really gave me the feels of being smarter and more powerful then my enemies.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">-No detailed map<\/div>You get 2 kinds of map in this game: one that shows the districts and one that shows your surrindings.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">-Rare bugs<\/div>I encountered two kind of biggie bugs during my playthrough and I looked up if anyone else has encountered them and I didn't find anyone, so they must be really rare.<br><br><br><u>In conclusion<\/u>: As a fan of Hack 'n' slash games and the first two LoS games I have to say that this is a must have. The game is very well optimized, so no worries about that. It has it's bad moments, but they're still mediocre at worst. <br>I love this even more than the 1st one actually. The story and drama feels kind of weak if you don't really care about it, but once you start to think about what just happened you'll be amazed. Don't listen to the critics (probably Konami just didn't pay for good reviews), this game deserves much more than that (8\/10 minimum).<br><br>P.S.: I feel like it's needless to say about this kind of games, but a controller is strongly recommended (I played with a Steam Controller and it was very comfortable and precise).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21166790', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21166790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21166790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21166790' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21166790\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21166790', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21166790_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21166790_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30934248\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198047186196\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"86920468\">JRDOOM<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 11.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazing game and story!

It is probably the closest someone got to make a full 3D experience of Castlevania Symphony of the night. As for the first reboot the game is also at its core a spectacle fighting game.<br><br>The story of the game is suspended between two moments in time. In the present, your character, Dracula, wakes up after a very\u2026very long sleep and faces a the evil deeds that are being made in what remains of his castle, now part of a whole city with a high tech facility rule by evil itself. Dracula also has to gain back his lost powers and it will do so traveling back in time to his old castle. Unlocking new areas and abilities will allow Dracula to travel more and more freely to every part of the levels in the typical Metroidvania style. Enemies will respawn every time in the same place giving you always some challenge. It may though get to become repetitive (a common problem with backtracking in this type of game design). What will not become tiresome is how beautiful the environments are! Especially the old castle, simply stunning. The same effort was not exactly put into enemy design, which are a bit more repetitive than in the prequel (no more mounting on orcs or giant spiders!)<br><br>The combat system is solid, strikes have impact force despite being almost all whip based and allow for a decent amount of combination, crowd control and power strikes, but not as much as tytles like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Mobility during combat is now much improved compared to the prequel, you can dash as much as you want in any direction, which really gives you the sensation of being a superpowered mischevious vampire that moves swiftly and strikes hard! The combat itself did not changed much from the first game. Magic attacks now use a sword and gauntlets instead of different colors of the whip attack, changing a lot the range of actions, but the combo scheme is copied into every weapon set (whip, sword and gauntlet alike).<br><br>The interesting combat mechanic of the series, the focus mechanic, comes back. This mechanic builds up a meter for chaining combos and variation of techniques used (as the meter of score for Devil May Cry) and is set back to zero if you are hit. Instead of just being linked to a score rating this focus meter is directly linked to the combat. Once it is filled enemies start giving magic refill, which you can absorb to fill up one of your two magic style (healing\/defense style with the sword or heavy attack style with the gauntlet). <br><br>Timing your block properly is probably the most efficient way to build up focus meter and create opening to attack even stronger enemies. The sync block mechanic (such is the name of this timing block thing) will create a sort of light explosion which will stagger enemies and slow time for a bit, great visual effect and good for planning your reposte.<br>I had the impressions that enemies and boss design had a step back compared to the prequel, but it may be due to the amount of time you will have to backtrack (especially for completionists).<br><br>In conclusion, I liked playing this title as much as the prequel, it is probably a more direct 3D successor to Castlevania than the first Lords of Shadows. It has some flaws for sure, but it a solid title if you wish for a good spectacle fighter with a Castlevania flavor.  I really hope a third title comes out taking the good of Lords of Shadows 1 and 2, combining them and smoothing the mistakes. That would really be a great game\u2026but unfortunately it is Konami we are talking about\u2026so don\u2019t hold your breath.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30063319', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30063319' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30063319\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30063319' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30063319\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30063319', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30063319_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30063319_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30026449\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007618668\/recommended\/239250\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"47352940\">Rubhs<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 43.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSecond part of this new Castlevania saga with a really weird new story of the Belmont's family.<br><br>Story.
