This game will appeal to those who want the REAL experience. This game is a simulator. And it's an ambitious one. It's a space civilization simulator, a universe warfare simulator, a complete capital ship simulator (think Picard in command of the Enterprise), a weapon and tactical simulator, a weather system simulator, a planet environment simulator, and MUCH MUCH MORE. The scale of this game is amazing. It's horrendous that it's received such unfair reviews. You name it, IT IS HERE. If you want to live in an alternative universe and be a starship captain, where whole alien empires clash, then THIS IS IT. The people who claim that the game is a &quot;failure&quot;, are the ones who were too lazy to spend the hours needed to read and learn the manual, because if you don't do that, you probably will be going nowhere fast. You need to be committed, you need to want to really be the captain of a large starship, and you need to really want to be in charge of all the systems it would have to offer. This isn't Star Trek Online for kiddies. This is the real deal. There are no second chances, and there is no easy dumbed down mode for the whimpy. You either know what you are doing or you are caput. Can't be afraid to start over. This is Dwarf Fortress for starship captains.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21354932', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21354932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21354932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21354932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21354932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21354932', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21354932_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21354932_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 128 people (20%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>14 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19709618\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197981888668\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"21622940\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9ef6b242a56a05c2c2a98f0bc709f30a3bed7264.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9ef6b242a56a05c2c2a98f0bc709f30a3bed7264.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9e\/9ef6b242a56a05c2c2a98f0bc709f30a3bed7264_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197981888668\/\" data-miniprofile=\"21622940\">Wikkheiser<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197981888668\/games\/?tab=all\">40 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197981888668\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197981888668\/recommended\/370810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn underrated indie gem. Derek Smart deserves credit for sticking to his guns, and sticking with this game. Universal Combat isn't pretty, easy or intuitive. But it's still an unmatched capital ship simulator with an unforgiving '90s-style attitude.<br><br>This game will not hold your hand (tip: read the manual) or tuck you into bed at night. It's definitely not for everybody. It's about outer space and it wants to kill you. It's a sandbox with the complexity of hardcore naval sims such as Silent Hunter.<br><br>It's about logistics, space battles, crew management, reactor meltdowns and nuking cities from orbit. You will be boarded, ransacked and the perpetrators will escape in a stolen shuttlecraft.<br><br>Your ship will be set adrift while on fire.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Why Universal Combat Matters<\/div><br>I didn't discover this game until recently. I've known about Smart since the early 2000s, but dismissed him and didn't give him a chance. He was a joke, a crank, his games were bad. That's what I thought, but in reality I didn't understand him. <br><br>Now I do ... I think.<br><br>Smart is foremost an engineer, as this game reflects an engineer's mindset. It's about spaceships, but it's really about complex systems, taking things apart and figuring out how they work. This has its downsides: Engineers are not celebrated for their empathy and they don't make for great artists. <br><br>But engineers do make great systems.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19709618', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19709618' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19709618\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19709618' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19709618\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19709618', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19709618_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19709618_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 161 people (19%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>16 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17294533\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cmdrmctosh\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"45402281\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0e7a2c17a9fb44cd43208e86541347785beea21.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0e7a2c17a9fb44cd43208e86541347785beea21.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f0\/f0e7a2c17a9fb44cd43208e86541347785beea21_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cmdrmctosh\/\" data-miniprofile=\"45402281\">Cmdr McTosh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cmdrmctosh\/games\/?tab=all\">83 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cmdrmctosh\/recommended\/\">26 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cmdrmctosh\/recommended\/370810\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 30, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI first found Universal Combat last year and immediately fell inlove with it, I was a bit sad at the time too as I was very aware it was a dead genre and, what I thought, a dead game.<br><br>&quot;I wish that crashing when landing on a plent bug got fixed&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish the ODS's actually did something&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish there was a bridge&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish the AI was tweaked a bit so enemies would attack more and not just run away from me constantly escaping through jump gates (ohh my god that used to pee me off)&quot;<br><br>These were some of the things I'd say to myself while playing but, I was aware I'd just downloaded a decade old game that had its final patch years ago and the developer had moved onto greener pastures so I knew the wishes wouldn't come true.<br><br>Then I started posting on the steam forums, and got involved in the UC community, made videos to show how easy it is to play. And out of nowhere one morning I felt like Christmas had just come. It was the morning I woke up to a post by Derek saying his interest in this series has once again been re-tickled and he's considering some 'minor tweaks' and 'small bug fixes'.<br><br>A few months later an entire DLC is launched that's gone above and beyond what I'd expected, and those wishes aren't wishes any more, but fact!<br><br>I haven't crashed once.<br><br>I found out quite by mistake that ODS's are now fully functional. Poor Lace. RIP.<br><br>I just had to spend 3 hours in a star station reparing my ship and restocking fighters after getting heavily battered by the enemy.. and I'd only made it as far as Pluto! <br><br>And Derek confirmed he's going ahead with the bridge.<br><br>Absolutely fantastic. What more can I say but thank you?!<br><br>10\/10 the UC experience just magnified by 10.

The very first space sim that I played was Universal Combat, which my brother bought on disk from a Ross bargain bin back in 2005. I was ten years old, used to playing Crash Bandicoot and Earthworm Jim. UC was a whole new experience for me; intricately designed to be the most expansive, in depth space simulator the world had ever seen up until that point. Was I confused? Lost? Afraid? Yes, of course I was. But I gave the game a chance because I wanted to experience all that it had to offer. I studied the 100+ page instruction manual nearly religiously, poured over every section even remotely related to the task at hand.<br><br>Were the controls confusing? Initially, yes. But with time and practice, I--even I as a ten year old child--found myself launching away teams of marines on planetside missions, assaulting enemy bases from orbit, conducting raids on space stations from my carrier while simultaneously commanding an echelon of fighter craft, fending off a boarding party while systematically shutting down portions of my ship to prevent their escape and more. Most people pick this game up expecting a fairly easy experience, thinking that they'll be artificially faster, stronger, and just better than the AI from the get go. My friends, this is not and should not be the case. Universal Combat is not a hard game, but it is no cakewalk. As long as the player takes the initiative to do their research and figure out how to play the game, they will be rewarded with a satisfying challenge in an expansive universe in which no one person is magically superior. Supremecy in the world of UC is earned, period.<br><br>When UC was added to Steam a few months back at the generous price of free (!!!), I grew ecstatic. I was eager to revisit a world that I had previously enjoyed in my youth. Initially, the Steam release was unplayable for me, and so I set it aside to be revisited at a time when I could enjoy it. With the recent patches, the game runs without crashing on my system, and I fully intend to spend some quality time with this gem. I purchased this DLC soley to support the improvement of this uniquely epic title.<br><br>Before simply dismissing a game as being rubbish, people should take the time to try to get to know it. If a task is found to be too difficult, don't just give up and claim the task to be impossible; persist, improve, re-evaluate the situation, and try again until a winning strategy can be ascertained. Before making accusations of immaturity, people should check their own behaviour and remember that developers are people too. There is a certain degree of professionalism to be expected, sure, but to expect a human being to remain cool and collected when they are constantly criticized for the ineptitude of others is borderline insane. If you have an issue with the game, try to constructively criticize it; don't just say &quot;Well this game is awful and I don't like the developer,&quot; because at that point you aren't doing anything more than whining. <br><br>And say whatever you want about Mr. Smart, but the man has made something of himself. He has been very successful over the years and has had the good fortune to be able to persue his passion and make a living from it. He has raised his children sensibly and taught them to work towards their goals, not just sit back and leech off of him. Whether or not you agree with his methods or his demeanor, Derek Smart has lived a life of his choosing, and no matter how many times people try to put him down, he will always be able to say that he is in control of his own life. How many of us can say the same? How many of us can continue to press on and try to improve ourselves and shrug off all of the negativity launched at us?<br><br>Who gives a toss if you don't like the man; review the game for what it is and don't let personal gripes drive you to be an immature hothead and trash the game because of the man in charge. While it is very clear that my opinion is in the minority, I have nothing but high hopes for what Mr. Smart will achieve with UC in the months to come and I hope that more people can at least give his game a chance before hopping on the Hate Train. <br><br>Or maybe I'm just a crazy fanboy suffering from nostalgia overload and upset that a great man is being shunned by the masses for being a real person and not some PR spewing puppet. <br><br>More info on Derek Smart can be found <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2012\/11\/14\/3553620\/the-redemption-of-derek-smart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >here<\/a> in this interview with him. Love him or hate him, he will continue to do what he does, and if we don't make room for him, he'll make his own way.
