It is unpolished and janky even by the series standards, but it's not incredibly buggy or anything, and literally feels like an old-school horror game from yesteryear that just fell out of a worm hole and released. It can stand proud among the company it comes from, is unapologetic of how old-school and cryptic it sometimes is, but chances are if you liked the Clock Tower games, you'll like this game. It takes a bit to get going, but when it hits its stride you may find yourself hooked.<br><br>PROS: <br>-Unapologetically Old-School. This won't be a pro for everyone, but the game targeted a niche fanbase of the Clock Tower games, and this game delivers what it promises to that fanbase. It feels like an old-school horror game, a Clock Tower game specifically, and it can stand proud with them since it's a good Clock Tower game. It has most of the same flaws the rest of the series does, but also the same strengths, and there is some new stuff sprinkled in, but it also doesn't modernize its vision.<br>-There are some really cool\/creepy scenes. I wouldn't define this game as scary (I didn't find the other Clock Tower games especially scary either I should mention, though), but there is some beautifully morbid scenes in this game. Some more surreal, some more gruesome. The gore is over the top. The game has a tendency of coming out of nowhere with a particularly nasty or horrific scene and sucker-punch you with it into some over-the-top horror scene (in a good way!). The game manages to tie everything nicely, while still feeling like it's creative enough to get away with what it wants. Notably, the game gets more twisted in the last fourth of the game compared to the rest of the journey.<br>-The story: It's not going to win any awards or blow anyone away, but the story is actually quite nice. It's got a lot of subtle details, things in the environment, hidden double meanings in some dialogue or small touches to bring it together. The story is extravagant (as Clock Tower stories usually go), but told in a hushed, more mannered way. It is a multi-layered story with a lot of elements it manages to bring together, but not with a bang, but a whisper, and some of it may stick with you. I didn't find any of the characters unlikable, and it's telling I would often look forward to the voiced cutscenes (that were often the more cinematic ones). If you pay attention, you may get more out of the story than others. The true ending is a bit brief, but supported with everything else the game says.<br>-The audio. The music is nice, with some stand-out tracks (maybe with the only disappointment I had being that the Scissorwalker's theme was a bit simple and repetitive), the voice acting is actually solid, hammy, but enjoyable. There's some very nice audio ques and sounds used to good effect in the game.<br>-It's campy: Between over-the-top deaths, hammy voicing in some places, some silly scenes and dialogue exchanges, there is enjoyable camp here, and camp that fits perfectly with what was present in past installments of the series.<br><br>MIDDLE: <br>-The graphics. It actually looks a lot better than I was expecting, but the visual consistency is all over the place. Some areas look really good, while others look kind of bad.<br>-Animations. Just like the graphics, the animation is all over the place. Some of scenes are actually expertly animated, there is some parts where they move like humans and respond and move in a realistic or creepy way... and then other times they look like dead-eyed fish people with no lip sync or sometimes movement that look like creepy dummies trying to imitate humans, or flailing about unrealistically or stiffly. It's some of the broadest in terms of quality animation I have ever seen, some of it looks great, some of it looks terrible.<br>-Bugs: The game is unpolished, but it's actually not all that buggy. It has a few bugs, but nothing that's game breaking I found (sometimes you may need to reload a previous save though). I put this in the middle since while there are 3-4 bugs I ran into, none of them were major, and for playing the game for 16 hours, there were far less than I was expecting.<br>-Scissorwalker: Maybe it's only because I've played the whole series before this, but I feel the Scissorwalker was less of a threat in this game than the other Clock Tower games. Not in such a huge way, I did die and he did threaten me, but it felt a bit more scripted here than usual, and I found it to not have quite the same presence as the Scissorman in previous games, but still an effective, cool, and interesting stalker antagonist.<br>-Obtuse: Expect to replay segments of the game because you missed some easily missable key item that, without it, you will end up at a dead end or bad end in the game. It's unforgiving &amp; stays true to this from the Clock Tower games. One new aid is when you go to load your game, there's a 'level flow' chart that shows the key points it branches at.<br><br>CONS: <br>-It's unpolished: The game is incredibly rough around the edges and unpolished. Fluctuating frame rate, small visual bugs, technical things, missing some options (Edit: Quit and return to menu have been added to the game as of Patch 1.02), jankiness... It's the game's biggest flaw for sure.<br>-The controls are sometimes finicky: While I found the controls fine most of the time, there are some scenes you really need to fight with the controls. The worst would be sometimes when you needed to go to another fixed camera angle but it was hard to walk into it since you needed to click the very sides of the screen to get there.<br>-Maybe the game is a bit too cryptic: The game doesn't explain much to you, it doesn't explain how to save, it hardly explains the stamina system, you can miss some minor thing and have to replay segments and try to figure out where it might be in long stretches of game; while they have a helpful flowchart on the load game screen, the game maybe is a bit too cryptic for its own good sometimes.<br><br>---<br><br>OVERALL: Liked it quite a bit, I feel like I'll want to replay this someday, I plan to get the last ending and find some more scenes I missed. I feel this stands tall with the rest of the series, and would look forward to replaying it in any sort of marathon replay of the whole Clock Tower series. It feels like a nice addition to Clock Tower, which is the biggest compliment I can give it. It's a good Clock Tower game, and one I think can stand with the rest of the series.<br><br>AN ASIDE: I can't imagine people who never played these older horror\/Clock Tower games to jump on this and fall in love with it immediately, it's a bit demanding and doesn't ease new players into the sort of game it is. It's a required taste and may only find a niche audience (I imagine trying to get someone who was grown and raised on modern horror games like Outlast, Slender, Amnesia, etc., may not quite understand this game's appeal, like trying to show someone raised on newer horror movies to enjoy some of the early classics of horror films), but for those who've wanted more games like this in their life, this is probably the truest old-school horror game to have released in years. Jank and all, you'll have a hard time finding a horror game that's this true to the old-school design philosophies of horror games like NightCry released in the last several years. I imagine this title will gain a cult status down the line, and be brought up as part of the Clock Tower series.<br><br>BEST PART OF THE GAME: Chapter 3, and some of the twisted horror moments in that chapter, interesting rooms and hidden scenes, some of the visceral imagery in some of the bad endings.<br><br>WORST PART OF THE GAME: All of its technical problems and general roughness that hopefully gets patched out some.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22148390', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22148390' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22148390\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22148390' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22148390\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22148390', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22148390_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22148390_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t66 of 91 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22528826\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75947485\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e8d0f2a7332a6bd4cb3c02295a71301f8e6044fe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e8d0f2a7332a6bd4cb3c02295a71301f8e6044fe.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e8d0f2a7332a6bd4cb3c02295a71301f8e6044fe_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75947485\">Qineuro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/games\/?tab=all\">545 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/recommended\/\">16 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Qineuro\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's a shame to see this game getting so many negative reviews.  I've been having a lot of fun with NightCry, in great part because it's exactly what's advertised.  If you've ever played any of the original Clock Tower games (on SNES and PS1, before Clock Tower 3 took things in another direction), you can expect a modern-looking game in the classical style.  A lot of the conventions and genre trappings haven't been updated at all, and I think that's where some of the dissonance comes from.<br><br>With NightCry, you can expect obtuse, illogical puzzles, fixed camera angles that often impede your control, point and click navigation instead of direct movement, an (occasionally) extreme level of difficulty, and a lot of bad endings that you won't immediately understand why you're getting.  If you're able to look past these things, you'll find a charming game with a very morbid, distinct sense of humor and a whole lot of heart.  The writing is just the right level of tongue-in-cheek, and the voice acting is hammy enough to be in on the joke without feeling stilted, cartoonish or absurd.  Early screenshots and trailers had led me to wonder, but the game has a surprising amount of visual polish and I find myself really admiring the aesthetic.  The real-time shadows are particularly impressive and add a lot to the atmosphere.  This isn't a AAA title, but if you've taken even a cursory look at the store page and read this far, you shouldn't be expecting one.  <br><br>Sound design in a horror game is incredibly important, and NightCry's use of audio deserves a special mention.  It's clear that a lot of care went into all of the sounds in this game, and everything fits together beautifully.  From the distinctive menu sounds, to the sharp, jarring *clink* and *slice* of scissors you hear almost immediately after beginning the game, from the terrifying quality of the &quot;chase&quot; music to the unexpected stingers that accompany jump scares, in my opinion NightCry's strong use of sound is one of its greatest assets.  Outside of a few particular moments the original Clock Towers never managed to scare me much, but in part thanks to the fantastic sound design, NightCry has been inspiring a refreshing sense of dread in me as I've been playing.   If you can allow yourself to let your guard down, NightCry finds some real and surprising ways to get under your skin.  The ability to be meaningfully tense and frightening outside of the cheap &quot;Gotcha!&quot; moments is something that few horror games nowadays can lay claim to.<br><br>There's flaws here for sure.  Though it's improved over the last few updates, the game is still buggy in a lot of places and prone to occasional crashes.  Some of the puzzles can be very frustrating, and could probably benefit from an in-game hint system.  Though I see it as a strength, the game design is definitely 10 or 15 years behind the times, and the clear product of another era.  If you're a Clock Tower fan, though, none of this should really matter.  NightCry is a faithful new installment in the franchise.  As much as I love and appreciate Haunting Ground, I'd call this the real &quot;Clock Tower 4&quot; that we never got back in the day.  This is a really cool game with a lot to offer, and if you're capable of checking your expectations at the door, any fan of oldschool horror and adventure games can find a lot of fun with this title.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22528826', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22528826' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22528826\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22528826' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22528826\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22528826', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22528826_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22528826_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t70 of 111 people (63%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22121384\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"58881846\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/55651f1e8e44a3567071cbb982638b3d5b3751ec.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/55651f1e8e44a3567071cbb982638b3d5b3751ec.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/55\/55651f1e8e44a3567071cbb982638b3d5b3751ec_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/\" data-miniprofile=\"58881846\">LordKardok<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/games\/?tab=all\">21 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/dark105\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNote: I have only reached chapter 2.<br><br>For the most part the game is good. The graphics are okay, but not cutting edge. The voice acting is good. The controls can be a little difficult to deal with at first, but you'll ween yourself into them after walking around for a few minutes. <br><br>The game does not tell you the controls, as far as my experience goes, so you'll need to teach yourself before getting to the first chapter (technically you start in the prologue). Once the first chapter starts, the game will give you instructions on how to move and interact while being chased. The game does not point you in any directions other than through interacting with objects or dialogue during cutscenes, so pay attention and attempt to not skip any details.<br><br>There is no menu in the game, or at least I couldn't figure out which key opened the menu. You can pause the game by using the P key. You can skip cutscenes by using the SPACEBAR. The inventory becomes available as you find items. The only real flaw with the exclusion of a menu is that there is no way to escape the game, even from the main menu. If you are in window mode you can just close the window, but if you are in full screen mode, you either have to Tab+Alt out of the game and close it, or Alt+F4.<br><br>The only bug I've encountered is during a struggle with the main enemy of the game. You have to click a button quickly in order to push off your pursuer, however, if an object that is interactable is behind that button, your character will interact with it and die immediately afterwords. For example, this bug occured while in room 301, in the bedroom, where I got cornered and somehow interacted with the bed while fighting off the Scissorwalker. There may be other bugs, I do not know yet.<br><br>There seems to be a graphical issue with the main character's hair and the lighting that causes FPS to drop. This may not occur for everyone, as I did not experience this issue, however, some people I know, and some in the community are reporting this issue.<br><br>The story is suspensful as it sets up multiple suspects to being the Scissorwalker (my money is on grandma in the elevator). The gameplay is very similar to it's predecessors of the Clock Tower franchise: running from an unkillable enemy, hiding, and solving puzzles. The horror is strong in this game as well. Fighting off the Scissorwalker sometimes becomes necessary, but it will quickly drain your stamina and eventually kill you. Even with full stamina, you can still fall to the floor and end up spending your extra stamina picking yourself back up. If you fall and have no stamina, you're likely to die. Sometimes you have to solve a puzzle while the Scissorwalker is chasing you, and sometimes you have to interact with a &quot;difficult to click on&quot; object. The Scissorwalker's name is also ironic, considering it's walking speed is that of your running speed, and it can occasionally run after you to close any large gaps you may have made between it and yourself.<br><br>Hopefully, in a future patch, we can see at least some of these issues dealt with.<br><br>EDIT: I forgot to mention three things.<br>1.) You auto save during checkpoints, but you can manually save using a &quot;phone charger.&quot; You get access to your phone later in the game, which gives you a light, and allows you to communicate with your friends, or at least the ones still alive.<br>2.) The history section of the main menu displays all the outcomes of important choices you made, and you can see the path you've taken in the save menu.<br>3.) When hiding, a heart will be displayed. The game does not mention what it's used for, but you must keep the heart as centered as possible to keep yourself from being discovered by the Scissorwalker. Some hiding spots will not always display the heart, which means the Scissorwalker will ignore those spots.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22121384', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22121384' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22121384\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22121384' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22121384\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22121384', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22121384_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22121384_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23732466\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bound-in-blood\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"70184822\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/252d2cde71ca63b0e7309c667729c01d05ad762f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/252d2cde71ca63b0e7309c667729c01d05ad762f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/252d2cde71ca63b0e7309c667729c01d05ad762f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bound-in-blood\/\" data-miniprofile=\"70184822\">Negan<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bound-in-blood\/games\/?tab=all\">189 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bound-in-blood\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/bound-in-blood\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you like old school horror games that often drift between extremely horrific and cheerfully insane at the drop of an awkwardly delievered line of dialogue?

Before that, it was near enough unplayable so it is good that the developers worked hard to fix this up fast.<br><br>It is an old school Japanese survival horror\/point &amp; click game so don't expect any miracles from a technical point of view here. If you recall playing the first Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark, Clock Tower games etc, it is very much in that kind of bracket. A sort of throw back to that style of game design which I really love. Sure, its a bit cheesy but still a lot of fun to play so try it out because it is also quite scary as well. The director of the Grudge films (Takashi Shimizu) helped develop the story on this game and it was created from crowd funding on Kickstarter.<br><br>The story follows a number of characters onboard a cruise ship as you try to help them unravel the mystery of the appearance of a murderous entity called the Scissor Walker who could jump out at you at any time and give chase. You can only run and hide or use objects in your surroundings to keep him at bay but he will return again at some point so it keeps you on your toes and on the alert as you never know when he might pop back up. The game doesn't hold your hand either so you will need your brain in gear to think about what to do next to progess onwards in certain areas.<br><br>The outcomes of your actions can lead the story down different paths as well. This meaning that there isn't just one set way the game can pan out. There are multiple possibilities on where the plot goes next depending on if you find certain items or not or talk to a particular NPC etc. This adds good replay ability as you obviously cannot run through all scenarios in one playthrough and this is a fun plus point to the game.<br><br>It isn't a perfect game by any means. The character interactions can sometimes be pretty cringe worthy and the movement is also a bit wooden and primitive looking at times. There is also an inconsistency in the voice work. Sometimes cut scenes have voice acting where you hear what is being said, then in the next, you only read subtitles to know what is going on. A strange choice to do that as some scenes play out in silence but you still see the characters moving and gesturing onscreen. I feel they should have either done one or the other here but that's just me. It doesn't affect the game too badly to be fair. I can excuse it but others may find this a bit of an issue.<br><br>NightCry uses the point &amp; click mechanic so if you are hoping for a free movement game here, you might want to reconsider. But, if you like this game style or fancy trying it out, then it is definitely worth giving NightCry a go.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22578625', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22578625' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22578625\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22578625' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22578625\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22578625', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22578625_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22578625_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23016737\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rainer_s\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"24551543\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1fcd4b53f5e9d9556072acfd9e153637bdde9668.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1fcd4b53f5e9d9556072acfd9e153637bdde9668.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1f\/1fcd4b53f5e9d9556072acfd9e153637bdde9668_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rainer_s\/\" data-miniprofile=\"24551543\">Rainer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rainer_s\/games\/?tab=all\">1,047 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rainer_s\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rainer_s\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 16, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSecond attempt, first review deleted, game completed. So I am one of those who have seen the end, now I can judge. ;-)  I do prefer the non-mainstream indie, obscure, weird and \u201cunpolished\u201d sort of (horror) games. That\u2019s what you get. <br><br>NightCry is an old school, third person horror point and click action adventure with clunky controls and animations. (In line with the \u201cClock Tower &amp; Resident Evil\u201d series.) But this is part of the game design and art style. <br><br>Checkpoint and save game feature is surprisingly well designed, so it\u2019s less frustrating to start over, after you messed up. (Game Over\/Dead End screen is your best friend\u2026;-)) Your objectives are not always clear outlined and the sometimes illogical puzzles can be challenging. There are still (non-game-breaking) bugs (missing mouse over markers) that make life hard for you to proceed. The 3 (very diverse) chapters are split into sub-scenes and lead into many different endings. The game builds up a terrifying and dense atmosphere, accompanied by an interesting plot. <br><br>So at the end it was really fun to play and a clear recommendation.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23016737', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23016737' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23016737\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23016737' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23016737\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23016737', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23016737_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23016737_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29021141\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/196357633\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"196357633\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab0f34d4b06cc0a054826463eff0a6e4074b57d8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab0f34d4b06cc0a054826463eff0a6e4074b57d8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ab\/ab0f34d4b06cc0a054826463eff0a6e4074b57d8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/196357633\/\" data-miniprofile=\"196357633\">Kamil.Retro_Gamer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/196357633\/games\/?tab=all\">24 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/196357633\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/196357633\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">25.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery good hide and seek horror  game for every clock tower, rule of rose and haunting ground game fans!

It reminds me a lot of a PSX or early PS2 game. <br><br>There are enough people who will talk about the technical problems. It feels like a fan translation of an old game, we'll leave it at that.<br><br>The stalker was pretty disappointing for me. It didn't have the 'actual crazy killer' vibe of the original Scissorman, it didn't have the so-bad-it's-good silliness of the supernatural Clocktower 3 villains, and it didn't have the deranged nonsense of the Haunting Ground stalkers. There weren't enough hiding\/defensive opportunities to have it be a random stalker, but maybe if they could improve the sound it made or something it could have been a LITTLE intimidating. It is a Masahiro Ito design, for crying out loud!<br><br>The atmosphere in general wasn't that good. It's never genuinely spooky - more like a haunted house attraction. There's no ambient sounds either, so you'll get these moments where it's just dead air and the shuffling of your character's ludicrous run cycle. The voice acting is reminiscient of House of the Dead, and even then only a few characters actually get voiced and only for a handful of conversations.<br><br>Better sound - quality, sfx, music, etc. - would greatly improve this game.

The odd characters, the strange and mysterious storyline, the creepy atmosphere and Scissorman, I can still remember what he sounds like dragging his scissors across the floor.<br><br>A lot of that carries over to Night Cry. It feels like a spiritual successor to Clock Tower.<br><br>Some of the same gameplay and technical issues from the Clock Tower series carry over. The camera can get in the way at times. When you're being chased by a killer, it can be difficult to make your character act quick and do exactly what you want without dying. But that's the nature of the game: die over and over until you solve the puzzle. That's also what makes the game great, because the death sequences are awesome to watch. You'll want to go back and unlock all of them.<br><br>One downside is that I felt like the game left me wanting more. There's a lot to the story that isn't really explained. I would've liked more levels and more diversity in the level design.<br><br>Hopefully we get a sequel in the future, because I would love more horror adventures from the developers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26364265', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26364265' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26364265\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26364265' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26364265\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26364265', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26364265_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26364265_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23868866\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198148323229\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"188057501\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6e22b869aba4bf5f558e21c77af68fb81df326b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6e22b869aba4bf5f558e21c77af68fb81df326b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f6\/f6e22b869aba4bf5f558e21c77af68fb81df326b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198148323229\/\" data-miniprofile=\"188057501\">Lukapyon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198148323229\/games\/?tab=all\">19 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198148323229\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198148323229\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've been very excited for this game ever since I encountered the Kickstarter of this game, and I finally came around to playing it the last couple of days.<br><br>I must say, the horror elements are right up my alley.

To start out, I found this game to be so humorous.  If you are looking for jump scares, there are a few.  But the main character was rediculous and tends to make the game play hard to take serious.  She has huge breasts and her walk cracks me up with her a** shake and the fact that she is pigeon toed.  I understand this is an indie game, but my stream found this to be more than funny!  They actually renamed the ship that I was playing on the &quot;PGE Downunder&quot; and the &quot;USS Full Penetration&quot; saying that PGE = Porno Gaming Entertainment.  <br><br>I thought the game was fun because of the commentairy that I provided made it even more amazing than it really was.  HOWEVER.  I have been on MANY cruises, and never once did I ever find a ship that sold Raman Noodles, cereal and canned foods in a store.  In what world is there actual vending machines and general food stores found on a cruise?  <br><br>Overall, the game was entertaining and because of that, I will recommend the game to streamers.  BUT, if you are not a streamer and just want a cheap thrill, this is not the game for you.

Not that you'd want to be anywhere near the same boat as the one in this story.<br><br>[Note: As of Late Jan 2017  my copy of the game (Win 10) crashes every so often. I haven't seen any solutions posted for this. Given this game is difficult and you can't save regularly you might want to consider this flaw before you buy. I still am OK with the price I paid which is \u00a312 in the UK  - I got through the whole game in about a week with only minor annoyances through crashes.]<br><br>This is a point and click style game with a plot like a cheesy horror film. If you like watching films with crazy occult stuff, weird monsters or even just slasher type teen screams, this game will probably provide you with a lot of entertainment.<br>If you're looking for a point and click style horror adventure, this is good.   <br><br>On the flip side, It is frustratingly difficult. But it is lots and lots of fun.<br>For perspective: Fun enough for me to finish it and then look for all the endings, grinning through all the times that weren't making me cover my eyes.  Frustrating enough for my boyfriend to swear repeatedly at the computer, thump the table and throw a grapefruit in the direction of the screen.<br><br><br>I'll start with pointing out the frustrating elements:<br>SAVE GAMES: There are some auto saves but if you want to make a free save you need your character to have found a mobile phone and have access to a phone charger. This takes a while during some chapters and is really annoying at the beginning of the 3rd chapter because you have to backtrack a lot when you die. And you will die a lot.<br>MINOR TRIGGERS: There are many endings to this game (which is good) but some of the final outcomes have really minor things needed for them to be triggered and you won't know about them for a good hour or two of gameplay. Then you have to backtrack a long way through some really boring bits if you want to find a better ending.<br>RATIONALITY: There is virtually none. This is a mad horror film. Forgetting to sneeze in an early section of the game can land you with a gruesome death two chapters later. And then you'll have to backtrack if you want to see a better ending.<br><br><br>Why I Liked it:<br>Firstly and foremost it's just a very likeable spoof of the horror genre. It's mad, it's moderately gory and it has a mildly scary, very weird monster that chases you around every so often.<br> I like the point and click adventure style of control which is present even through the scenes where a monster chases you. Ideal for those of us that don't want every game to be twitchy. The running scenes are still moderately challenging.<br>The plot is essentially a slowly disclosed mystery and it is engaging although not exactly original.<br><br>So in short, I enjoyed this game but I had the patience to put up with the crashes and I was ok replaying large chunks of it to look for the best ending. If you can do that and you like the horror genre and point and click adventure games you'll love this. <br><br>Genuinely, I recommend this despite its flaws. Lots of fun.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29533213', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29533213' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29533213\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29533213' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29533213\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29533213', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29533213_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29533213_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29295899\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198030348355\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"70082627\">BrainOnSlugs<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a classic Clock Tower game to a fault.

Not that horrible &quot;sequel&quot; on PSX. I consider this a true successor. CT on SNES, then released on PSX as &quot;The first fear&quot;, then the real direct sequel simply called Clock Tower on PSX, and then this. CT2 The struggle within and CT3 are not only not part of the same storyline, but also very bad games. As for NightCry, it is simply what I was expecting.<br><br>I will not enter in the story's details because it is very short and easy to figure out. I will simply address some nonsensical criticisms of this game.<br><br>- Bad Graphics: honestly, for what it does, it has exceptional graphics. Runs smooth, no crashes, polished interface. It doesnt show that it was originally intended for mobile phones at all.<br><br>- Point-and-Click: this is a true adventure game. Any criticism on this aspect is either by young boys that didnt grow up in the nineties \\ late eighties, and therefore dont even know what to do with their keyboard unless there is a floating hint bigger than the screen itself telling them what to do, OR by people that played the original CT way back in their childhood and therefore have nostalgic memories of it, which in turn reduces \\ takes out any awkward experience with the controls and induces them to think this is a bad game. It is not.<br><br>There. Now that both are out of the way, what remains is a genuine CT experience. There is absolutely nothing different. Any aspect that made the series so bad it's good is present, and some like the QTEs havre been improved to facilitate the player. The art design is solid and consistent, as its gameplay. In the key features of a true CT, bad voice acting, lacking animations and big fonts that stay on screen for over a minute are a must, a well recognized trademark of decades past.<br>And that's exactly what this game is, a marvellous piece of software made for 1998, spawned in 2016 via a time machine. Would I want it any other way? No. It was all I was asking for. A classic formula that I can enjoy today like yesterday, a gameplay experience that fits like a velvet glove in my hand, a glove that I've never taken off. It feels nostalgic, and plays nostalgic, but it is objectively never difficult or not precise. Maybe before all the patches it was not very responsive, but since I bought it now, I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I knew what I wanted, and I got it, all. <br>I sincerely hope that other &quot;old&quot; developers will keep on making what they do best even today in this merciless market. It's in times like these that I bless the kickstarters.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28857534', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28857534' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28857534\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28857534' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28857534\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28857534', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28857534_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28857534_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26521381\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/steca\/recommended\/427660\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"10248587\">Toha Heavy Industries<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 10, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNightCry is an ode to Japanese games from the 90s, badly translated, full of bugs and inconsistency. To when games were made with close to no budget, by small teams, with very basic and simple concepts. It's an ode to when games had a soul. To the <b> PSX <\/b> era, and of course to the <b> Clock tower <\/b> serie.<br><br><u> What you should <b> NOT <\/b> expect from this game: <\/u><br>- fancy graphics. Lot of assets reuse and blurry textures. It's pretty much an upscaled phone game.<br>- good level design. Long, very, very long corridors. No landmarks at all in any area. No way to tell any room apart from each other's.<br>- good voice over. No. It's not very good. And sometimes it's pretty awful. But in a weird twisted way, it reminds me of when they realized they could put VO on PSX games due to the copious disc space and started translating Japanese games (or at least they tried). Odd pause in the middle of a sentence and inappropriate tone of voice.<br>- and of course, don't expect any kind of logic. You won't find any. At all.

It embraces both everything you love and hate about the Clock Tower series; for every creepy moment, there is an important item in some obscure location that will screw you over later on should you miss it. The voice acting is awkward and the plot is basically missing but the game has enough charm and atmosphere to keep you drawn in regardless. For fans of the Clock Tower series (particularly the Playstation entries), I would absolutely suggest giving this game a chance (preferably during a sale). Closing thoughts: Rooney is super adorable even if she's batshit insane.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25995459', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25995459' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short25995459\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25995459' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short25995459\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25995459', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25995459_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short25995459_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/427660\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 156 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22148390","22528826","22121384","23732466","22578625","23016737","29021141","26611008","26364265","23868866"]}
