She completely mischaracterised and cheapened the depth of character in the original BG series and in the typically arrogant way of SJWs, asserted that her view of social issues was the one and only view, heretics be damned.  There are a number of good articles that have been written on the subject, and some good posts on Beamdog's forums that really highlight the unfortunate nature of this.<br><br>Now, for the game.  I was expecting this to be much worse based on the commentary I was reading.  In fact, it's a very beautifully crafted world and whilst the plot may be simplistic and conflict with the original plot, it is not anywhere as bad as say, for example, the STAR WARS prequels and post-Lucas films have been for that franchise.<br><br>The creators of this game very clearly put a lot of effort into it.  Many of the voice actors should not have been brought back, as their vocal chords make the characters sound much older and worn down than they should.  Other voice actors are fantastic!<br><br>Some of the gameplay is challenging, and the AI for combat is certainly improved (both for your party and for your opponents).  The large encounters are interesting, and it is clear that Beamdog was able to incorporate some elements of gameplay that the original creators had wanted to but were unable to for whatever reasons.<br><br>I think the general consensus on this game is fair.  The political nonsense infuriated me, but one developer's fanatically Marxist views cannot detract from the overall quality of the game and it is unfair for the other developers and contributors to suffer as a consequence.  This is a great franchise and I think SoD has proven that BGIII could be done effectively...  Provided that this woman is fired from her role and no more SJW nonsense pollutes Faerun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29369904', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29369904' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29369904\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29369904' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29369904\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29369904', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29369904_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29369904_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28905742\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rougemacabre\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"75125426\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c70cbf244782f900237f79b36d3ea75890d6b737.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c70cbf244782f900237f79b36d3ea75890d6b737.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c70cbf244782f900237f79b36d3ea75890d6b737_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rougemacabre\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75125426\">RougeMacabre<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rougemacabre\/games\/?tab=all\">126 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rougemacabre\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/rougemacabre\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTL:DR - Fun enough for isometric RPG fans but the writing lacked some of the depth of the original campaign.<br><br>I just completed Siege of Dragonspear and overall, recommend the expansion to fans of isometric RPGs. The level design was well done and I enjoyed the battles and side quests made available, as well as the overall look of the dungeons. Conceptually, they came up with something to work within the Baldur's Gate themes (as spoiler free as possible: nature vs. nurture, destiny vs. free will.) However, I felt the writing was not on par with the original game. It wasn't bad per se, but lacked the subtly the first game offered. I enjoyed the new characters to the team, especially in terms of class, but again, found their personalities (overall) to lack the combination of light-heartedness and weight the original cast possessed. They expanded on the original cast (Imoen, Khalid) and there they did a good job providing depth to characters that were largely ignored in the original campaign.<br><br>I would play Siege of Dragonspear again, perhaps as a evil aligned character. It would be interesting to work with the evil-aligned cast members and see how things turn out with darker choices. Baeloth had a good voice actor and amusing alliteration throughout his lines but I didn't include him in my party as I was going a more heroic path. Equally, the new goblin party member (True Neutral) seemed like an intriguing inclusion.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28905742', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28905742' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28905742\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28905742' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28905742\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28905742', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28905742_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28905742_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22260582\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"5627863\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bf0b92cad33789b9a4a94b580252ada6817b7e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bf0b92cad33789b9a4a94b580252ada6817b7e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/88\/88bf0b92cad33789b9a4a94b580252ada6817b7e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/\" data-miniprofile=\"5627863\">Valandryl<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/games\/?tab=all\">128 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197965893591\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, I just finished SoD and here's what I think of it.<br><br>First : the story. This add-on is the link that was missing between BG and BG2, the story is pretty interesting even though you realize very fast that your character goes in the wrong direction and it's a bit frustrating because you have no control over the way your character deals with the story. <br>The story has a few drawbacks, first of which is its terrible linearity. This add-on sometimes made me feel like ToB, I mean you litterally thread a path that's already written, with little to no choice, you clear a few outdoors areas and several dungeons. But the comparison with ToB stops here, SoD is more fun, dungeons are shorter, and it's not all about slaying tons of dragons or such creatures.<br><br>Then, the game itself. The XP cap isn't that high, I ended with around 450k xp on my main character, so the whole add-on will bring you a couple levels but don't expect more. In a way, it's close to ToSC. You will only gain 1 or 2 extra levels out of the whole DLC. Monsters are pretty much the same as you encounter in the beginning of BG2, including vampires, wraiths, etc. <br>All in all the game is well balanced and fights are neither too easy nor unfeasable. <br><br>What do I regret ? The choice of companions. In BG and BG2, it was possible to have both Minsc and Edwin in the party at the same time. In SoD there's no way this is gonna happen. And this sucks because if you want a melee fighter, well... Dorn and Khalid become available in the middle of the add-on. So before... You have Minsc and, a bit later, Jaheira. And this really sucks, a very poor roster. No Branwen (best priest in BG IMHO), no Coran, no Kivan (well you're given a good archer though), no paladin. I'd have apreciated a bit more variation in the list of companions to take with me.<br>And this gets bad when it comes to reputation. You'll gain several points of reputation and in the end it may become difficult to keep Edwin and Viconia if you want them (and Edwin is, as usual, by far the best mage in SoD). I had to avoid turning in 2 quests to keep my repuation at 18 in the end... Because at the end of the game, there's not much to do to lower your reputation.<br>Last but not least, SoD has a tendency to make some of your best items from BG disappear when you start the add-on... Like, for example, the ring for mages you got on the map of Friendly Arm Inn. Or my mace that had 10% chances to stun. These items just vanished in the air, like this, poof... <br><br>Anyway, despite these 2 points, the game was enjoyable, not as strong as BG or BG2 SOA, but better than ToB and on-par with ToSC. I never felt bored and really, it was a lot of pleasure to see, at last, something new in the BG saga ! Especially when this something new is good.<br><br>Oh, and everywhere I read that the add-on is said to last about 25 hours. In my case, I finished it in 12-15 hours without any spoiler. So it's really shorter than what I expected.  <br><br>Is this add-on faithful to BG ? Yes, it is. The gameplay is exactly the same, the story is pretty good, and except for the linearity it's a good addition to BG : EE and BG2 : EE.

I can always come back to in replaying it from start to finish. Its like a journey. In my eyes its the perfect game. Perfect roleplay experience. So of course when I heard that beamdog was making an expansion to the original game I was skeptic. Its hard to meet up to the standards of interplay. A lot of complaints I see for the expansion is that its &quot;too linear&quot;, the writing isn't good and diehard fans are upset with how they made changes with some of the characters. The gameplay is linear. It kind of reminds me to throne of bhall although in that expansion you had some options. I do see what people mean by dialogue being simplified. Its like you have three options; good, neutral, and evil which translates to nice, sarcasm, and rude and leads to the same outcome in most cases. I don't like it but I see this with most modern rpgs. Its disappointing but its like I'm accustomed to it by now. Dragon Age 2 did it. Mass Effect did it. Fallout 4 did it. Point is thats not all that makes a good game good. It weakens it but doesn't make it bad. What seems to have led to alot of poor reviews is that a lot of gamers are offended but some hidden agenda by the creators to add gay, lesbian and transsexual chracters into the game and be accepting of it. I guess I understand if some gamers feel its forced but I honestly think they should get over it and shut the hell up. Cause I'm guessing alot of those people that gave poor reviews didnt even finish the game. Cause their feelings were hurt. This expansion adds some interesting characters and has some decent lines to characters from previous games that really made me smile. Its not as good as the classics but the gameplay and combat is still there. You really cant mess that up. The battles are big and satisifying. It ties in well to the original game. One thing I like too is it lets you try out some of the classes that maybe you never got to play cause they were only available to the player character. I think its pretty cool to have the option to recruit a goblin shaman. Its worth playing. It helps to have an open mind since it probably wont meet the standards youre expecting if youve already played the first two game\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29550391', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29550391' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29550391\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29550391' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29550391\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29550391', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29550391_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29550391_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t29 of 66 people (44%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26411265\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Boostigaming\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93466176\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b93d5cf7741c5b2da1523c001ef1cabd14e50415.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b93d5cf7741c5b2da1523c001ef1cabd14e50415.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b9\/b93d5cf7741c5b2da1523c001ef1cabd14e50415_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Boostigaming\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93466176\">THE BOSS OF THIS GYM<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Boostigaming\/games\/?tab=all\">156 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Boostigaming\/recommended\/\">6 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Boostigaming\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 3, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThey released a buggy game and are to be jugded for it.<br>However, most of the technical issues were since fixed and are no longer a problem. What does enrage people is dlc's poor writing. I must say that it is indeed badly written compared to original games and it is a big letdown, but not to an extent that it is absolutely trash, it is just mediocre. Some people also pointed out forced LGBT characters, but I just can't see why people can't ignore them. Yes, Mizhena is transgender and I absolutely do not care. The story doesn't revolve around these characters being gay, so what's the big deal?<br><br>I'm glad beamdog didn't just sit there and watch the negative feedback.

However, you could cast invisibility on your party and just walk right past them, poison the food and just get out. But hey, it's Baldur's Gate we are talking about here, so I guess I shouldn't be surpised. All I'm saying is, in some other game the conversation would probably be triggered even if you are invisible.<\/span><\/span><br><br>Aside from all letdowns, the game is well made, it just didn't live up to the original in terms of story. It is still Baldur's Gate, the game doesn't hold your hand. The backgrounds are beautifully crafted and the overall attention to detail is astonishing compared to the previous games. I repeat, the attention to detail is ASTONISHING. The soundtrack is amazing and the cutscenes are good, though some people seem to hate that kind of style. Last time I was this immersed in a game was when I played Mask of the Betrayer, which is also a dlc, but for Neverwinter Nights 2. For reasons I wrote above, the gameworld looks and feels convincing, just like a real place that could exist.

What should have been a reintroduction for fans and newcomers alike is probably instilled into many, including my former self, as the Baldur's Gamer-Gate. <br><br>As someone who had refused to purchase SoD because of how BeamDog handled its release, it would be sad if fans never experience this content once the bugs are fixed. If SoD succeeds in one important way it is this: The transition of the tone and plot from both games helps new players find closure to BG1. <br><br>Fans who beat BG eighteen years ago have likely come to terms with the weak resolution of the original and the jarring introduction of BG2. For those fans, the expansion may be worthless, but there are moments within SoD that show respect for the license often forgotten. These little touches make the heartaches that follow carry more impact; or they may be bittersweet smiles of a former glory worthy to recall. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">&quot;Really, It's All About...&quot;<\/div><br>Without going into detail about every black-mark, I am going to address its writing as well as its technical issues. My intentions are to bring up problems BeamDog have not address, not pick at wounds. (Please note that I intentionally sought out the &quot;problematic&quot; elements.) <br><br>The most shocking thing I discovered is how much the &quot;SJW&quot; agenda has been exaggerated. If I had to give a ratio of how much that content exists, then there wouldn't be five minutes compared to the twenty hours I played. (And I would have done all the content if it was playable.) Even when it is there, it feels like poor, snarky satire.<br><br>When it comes to the issue of SoD's token characters and &quot;improved&quot; females, I think people forget how much BG1 used tropes. BioWare often uses tropes for subversion; and compared to the original, BG2 has more character development. SoD, however, suffers less from character development problems as its character flaws.<br><br>Though some of these tropes are obviously modern, I don't think their inclusion is out of place. (Girdle of Femininity\/Masculinity, anyone?) It can be jarring when modern ideas are in high-fantasy as I found in Witcher 2, but when it comes to characters from previous games I found their portrayal believable from before and after SoD. (Safana's romance ending, however, was too harsh.)<br>\t<br>The main problem with SoD's writing is that BeamDog is limited to expand on anyone between games. This, I believe, is why the writing quality is on par\u2014though slightly better because of its linear design\u2014with the original. <br><br>The greater issue when it comes to SoD, as well as the latest versions of their games, are the technical messes they have made. (Because I focused on BioWare in my review of BG1, I think I should mention these issues in BeamDog's content.) These issues, however, are not just problems for SoD but for the originals.<br><br>The first problem is how many bugs still plague the latest version. As I played the old version of BG1, I had few issues compared to the many quest-breaking bugs and crashes of SoD. What keeps this review a positive recommendation is that you can access the older versions. Had there not been a solution I would be more upset with BeamDog.<br><br>Second, BeamDog messed with the import function. You must import a game from BG1 to BG2 with the modern version. The import option is not available in the older versions; however, there are no issues transferring a file from BG1 (v1.3) to SoD (v2.2\/v2.3 only) to BG2. You will have to start the game in the modern version, save it, then relaunch the game in the old version to play the file. I can confirm that it works.<br><br>The only technical issues I couldn't verify are working mod-support and multiplayer. However, I did notice that there were plenty of servers available, so I think this issue had been addressed. To be safe, you should look into the matter yourself.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Road to Hell...<\/div><br>As mentioned beforehand, the writer's problem for SoD is how it is forced in-between two games that have been established for over a decade. It is remarkable then how well BeamDog has been able to handle bridging the storyline as well as understanding what elements of BG's plot in both games work so well.<br><br>At the end of BG1, the conflict of the Bhaalspawns and the resolution with the impending war of Amm were questions that would irritate new players to BG2. SoD not only provides a resolution for those conflicts but it also ties the events in a way to expand on lingering questions you may have: &quot;What makes a son of Bhaal special? (And are there children of other gods?)&quot;, &quot;Why does the bloodline matter?&quot; and <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>&quot;How do I really know I'm the son of Bhaal?&quot;<\/span><\/span><br><br>In the tale of the Bhaalspawn, it weaves the war amongst the Sword Coast these lingering questions and more with the introduction of the Hooded Man (who is obviously the antagonist of the next game) and Caelar Argent, a child who also shares divine blood but from a god of Justice. The dream-sequences of Sarevok, the Bhaal blood, etc. add a lot more pressing weight to the realization at the end of the first game. And while the plot's emphasis on the futility of fate is beter in the following game, its introduction here serves a purpose to describe the rise and fall of the Hero of Baldur's Gate.<br><br>The narrative also helps foster attachments to fan-favorites in one more adventure before what awaits them. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>For example, you can help Khalid make an anniversary gift for Jaheira as well as fight alongside them in a siege battle. Or you can travel along with Minsc and Dynaheir together.<\/span><\/span> The banter each character provides is more polished than the caricatures of BG1 because of SoD's linearity. Even if you know what happens and the lingering doom that awaits cannot be altered, the addition of having more time to bond with these characters is worth the admission.<br><br>That is how I would describe the unspoken theme of SoD: Knowing the inevitable fate ahead and its many hardships and choosing to act in the moment for what it's worth. (Similar idea to Dragon Age 2's &quot;role-playing.&quot;)<br>\t<br>It is a shame then that however masterful BeamDog understands how BG works mechanically, thematically as well as in its story and characters that they could not learn how to make a compelling antagonist. Instead, the Hooded Man steals the spotlight for what should have been a figure to represent the pitfalls of the antagonist of the next game, Caelar Argent. <br><br>Her inclusion into the BG universe feels all for nothing not because she's a character blinded by her own godlike arrogance but how stupid her motives are. Like I had mentioned before, she is a trope\u2014but unlike how BioWare handles tropes, BeamDog lacks subversions. Once you have learned her tragic backstory, it doesn't provide any motive to excuse her recklessness. It would have been better had she stayed an arrogant figure who didn't know her limits and made a grave error as a result; instead, she appears incompetent.<br><br>Thankfully, where the developers truly shine is how the quests of SoD are often the better parts of the original like Durlag's Castle. Although it's by no means as puzzle-oriented, the various options, subplots and variety of quests rarely ever are dull. The only parts of the game that aren't as highly polished are the siege battles. There are simply too many units on the battlefield to balance it, which makes me wonder if that is why Story Mode was created. The spectacle and options make these moments tolerable. <br><br>By the end, I had felt BeamDog proved they understood what makes Baldur's Gate is what it is. And for a modern developer to make a commitment to recreate a '90s game in modern times, they have my respect for that pursuit.<br><br>It's a shame then how afterwards a part of me wonders if the game's message of &quot;the road to hell&quot; wasn't also an unfortunate meta-commentary about the good intentions of the developers.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25863990', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25863990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25863990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25863990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25863990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25863990', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25863990_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25863990_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t49 of 114 people (43%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23996524\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tinyfenix\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"183666471\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/61\/61db4ca72969747b33754ac54891e0ad5614a8f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/61\/61db4ca72969747b33754ac54891e0ad5614a8f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/61\/61db4ca72969747b33754ac54891e0ad5614a8f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tinyfenix\/\" data-miniprofile=\"183666471\">tinyfenix<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tinyfenix\/games\/?tab=all\">113 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tinyfenix\/recommended\/\">11 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tinyfenix\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI own these games with all the dlc on my tablet and now I do on steam. 100% worth purchasing it all twice. <br><br>Don't listen to the &quot;gamergate&quot; kids. There's no &quot;liberal lgbt agenda&quot; there's no morals shoved down your throat, theres no changed content. There is only extra, excellent I might add, optional content that has been added. It's the same game I grew up loving but, just, with MORE. How could anyone complain about that? Oh, that's right, a female was involved with writing the new content (that you don't have to play if you don't feel inclined to). Such a travesty...<br><br>There are complaints about UI problems, bugs, glitches, etc. I have over 100 hours now between tablet play and on PC and have found none of these issues. The UI is updated to be more user friendly between platforms. It's like a sleek version of the original BG2 UI. It's fine. If there are bugs and problems that exist that I haven't found, well, it's a video game. These things happen. <br><br>All in all, this is an amazing, fantastic purchase (even at full price) and 100% worth your hours of time and money. <br><br>All I can surmise is that the dozens of bad reviews are from the gamergate hivemind just making things up because they're mad that women exist in the gaming industry. <br><br>Buy this game.

The challenge was tricky : create a bridge between the end of Baldur's Gate I and the beginning of Baldur's Gate II, while respecting the soul of the game, the visual style, the personality of the different characters and companions, the universe, the previous and future events to come, etc. The result is surprisingly well put together and enjoyable in many levels.<br><br>SoD starts right after the end of Baldur's Gate I. Reunite with your old friends to start another journey through new areas of the Sword Coast against the Shining Lady and her crazy Crusade. In addition to the original cast, meet four new potential companions : a Flaming Fist Captain, a Goblin, a Gnome and a skald helping Jaheira. Talking about new things, there is also an additional playable class for druid \/ summoners lovers : the Shaman.<br><br>There were lots of bugs at the beginning, specially in multiplayer. I encountered some bugs of my own, like random crashes or achievements not unlocking. I hope they'll fix everything soon enough. Nothing that keeps you from playing or finishing the game, tho.<br><br>I must admit that I actually enjoyed the storyline and the overall game : it's really worth playing if you loved the previous games and want to go back one last time to Baldur's Gate. The only flaw that I found a little disappointing was the fact that the previous areas aren't available anymore once you move on with the game, even if you haven't completed every quest there or so ; makes the game a lot more linear than the others BG.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25256700', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25256700' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25256700\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25256700' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25256700\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25256700', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25256700_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25256700_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 49 people (33%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25289555\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013981893\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"53716165\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e89505f808b891a9d221ef813fd74877a4f0872.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e89505f808b891a9d221ef813fd74877a4f0872.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4e\/4e89505f808b891a9d221ef813fd74877a4f0872_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013981893\/\" data-miniprofile=\"53716165\">Charisma<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013981893\/games\/?tab=all\">173 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013981893\/recommended\/\">18 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198013981893\/recommended\/385970\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe baldur's gate games are among my favorite games ever. I bought the first game when it came out and there is no other game I've played over again more times than baldur's gate 2. So I had high expectations for this expansion. And I really liked it!<br><br>Siege of Dragonspear fills the time gap between the games, and is well written. The only new NPC I tried out was Schael, but I really liked her. Looking forward to having the other companions with me in future playthroughs. There are many new items, a good story, music, dungeons and roleplaying opportunities. This expansion is also much longer than I expected, which is great. Having many of the same voice actors as the original game is also really nice.<br><br>Overall I think Beamdog did an excellent job with this game and I am really looking forward to seeing new games from them in the future. Siege of Dragonspear shows that they really have what it takes to make a great game on their own.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25289555', 'summary' );
