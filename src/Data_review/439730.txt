You'll fight your way through various levels killing aliens and bosses whilst collecting loot and upgrading yourself. When you start the game you can choose which character you\u2019d like to play as, though right at the start you\u2019ll just have one. Each char has a different loadout as well as different starting AI enhancements so as you unlock more you\u2019ll have more options to play. You\u2019re dumped right into the game world and you\u2019ll find yourself on a planet with just your gun and a melee weapon. Each planet is inhabited with various nasties who will try their hardest to kill you and your job will be to fight your way through these until you reach the bottom and destroy their boss. <br>Similar to Vertical Drop Heroes HD you\u2019ll find each level you start at the top and must fight your way down rather than left to right like most games like this. This adds another level of challenge to the gameplay as once you go down it\u2019s not always possible to get back up. But the levels themselves can be fully destroyed allowing you to create your own paths up and down if needs be.<br><br>The gameplay seems simple at first glance but the more you play the more you realise you must play a little more carefully than most games like this. The enemies you encounter are not only quick but they are strong, each with their own attack and attack style and they are only interested in your demise. You have two weapons you can use to defend yourself, the first being your gun and the second a melee weapon. Though you start with a specific weapon as each character, you can find new weapons in canisters and some enemy drops as you play through the level so you can find ones that suit your fancy if your default one is not to your liking. Weapons have three stats: Damage, Speed and Knockback and each weapon will differ in these stats. Weapons come in tiers and the higher the tier the better the weapon usually, though higher tier weapons only drop from mini-boss and boss fights and occasionally as \u2018Intel\u2019 or secondary mission rewards.<br>You can also find weapon mods and AI enhancements that\u2019ll increase your stats or give you perks throughout that run. Weapon mods are automatically added to your current weapon and can do things such as increase the attack speed or damage for example. AI enchantments can be found from canisters and monster drops but they can also be bought at a Distro Machine (I\u2019ll explain this a little later on). There are various different types with various different perks and each is different to the last. There are some basic ones that allow you to do things like dash left and right, give you a basic shield when you stand still or jump higher but others get a little more advanced. There are enhancements that allow you to navigate the map better (rocket jumps, wall climbing, floor smashing), enhancements to help you with vision and tracking (treasure trackers, radar, enemy stats) and some that\u2019ll help with combat (fire trail, slowing enemies, rocket fire). These can be bought using \u2018units\u2019 that drop on enemy death and can be found in canisters also. AI Enhancements will often be integral to completing the game because the difficulty will increase each level and there are very few ways to get stronger other than them.<br><br>The two currencies in game are Units and Xolyrium. As I explained before units are found and can be spent at distro machines, but when you die you lose all your units. There is one Distro Machine on each level and it is here that you\u2019ll be able to buy your AI enhancements as well as refill your batteries and explosives. Since units can\u2019t be carried over from run to run you\u2019ll want to spend as much as possible whenever you can because you never know when you\u2019ll die. Xolyrium is also found in the same places as you find units however it does not disappear when you die. Xolyrium has two main uses, the first being upgrades. Upgrades are can be bought between runs and are permanent. They will carry across no matter which character you are playing so the more you play and collect Xolyrium the easier the game will get in theory. These upgrades are more simple things such as extra life bars and increased explosive damage but you\u2019ll find upgrading these things to be a priority if the game is too difficult. The second thing you can spend Xolyrium on are drones that help you out within the level. These can only be bought in-game and they die at the end of the level but they are very strong and can help you out a lot. You can also use your Xolyrium to upgrade these in the upgrade menu to make them stronger or able to navigate slightly better.<br><br>Your main mission is to find and kill the boss of each stage but most levels will have a secondary objective which is optional. These can range from killing a certain amount of a mob type, opening canisters or destroying a certain amount of terrain. Once completed you can turn these into the Distro Machine for a reward which is usually an assortment of Xolyrium, units and weapons, maybe a weapon mod or two if you\u2019re lucky. You can also find an intel node on every level which when activated you must defend until all the data is downloaded. Waves of enemies will spawn in this time making this particular objective very difficult but the rewards are more than worth it if you can survive. Once you\u2019ve completed the game you\u2019ll unlock a new character so you can play again with different tactics.<br>Each level is randomly generated so no two feel the same and the game has tons of replayability because of this and the randomly generated drops, planets and side mission means the game can be played over and over and never feel boring.<br><br>There are only a few issues with the game but the main one can be pretty problematic. Nothing in the game is explained and I mean nothing. It took me a long time to figure out what the basics did and even after 4 hours of playing I figure out something new here and there. The gameplay is so fantastic and there are a ton of awesome features but you really wouldn't know it from the first 20 minutes of playing. A simple tutorial would solve all of these issues and make the game a lot more accessible. My second con is the story. I know this is a personal opinion but I found the story to be thin and barely understandable. This isn't helped by the fact that the only two snippets of story you currently get are at the start and when you finish a game. The story you get at the start is poorly written and the grammar in it stops the sentences from making sense, for example 'The United Earth Alliance caused more harm than good trying to go along with the inevitable. By supporting their own agenda of mass producing AI combative force and alien weaponry, to invade other planets called The Exoplanets.' and 'wiped out of the planet'.  Lastly an option to turn off the flashing when playing would be so helpful. Fighting a boss becomes very chaotic and I found myself feeling sick a few times despite never having experienced this before because of the constant flashing from both the bosses and the background. Also with enemies jumping everywhere, bullets flying, loot spraying around and explosions it all becomes a big flashy mess at times. I really do love the graphics but sometimes they just become too much after an hour of playing continuously.<br><br><b>Overall I can honestly say XO-Planets is an amazing game with tons of content and replayability. Even though in Early Access XO-Planets is more than playable, devilishly difficult and worth every single cent. Though the story is a little bit weak the gameplay is ridiculously addictive and this is a must try for any Risk of Rain fans out there.<\/b><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22985214', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22985214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22985214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22985214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22985214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22985214', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22985214_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22985214_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23109012\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fa\/fa42a2bbe2a1fffe7771cebd48d2c9879bd7da5f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/\" data-miniprofile=\"37459217\">Zorder<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/games\/?tab=all\">2,516 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/\">179 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zorder\/recommended\/439730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while XO-Planets was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received XO-Planets for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>XO-Planets<\/b> is best described as a roguelike\/roguelite platformer. When I first saw it on Steam it immediately reminded me of a Risk of Rain with the visuals of They Bleed Pixels and Probability 0.<br><br><u><b>Story overview:<\/b><\/u><br>One thing that intrigued me from the start was the story. After an alien invasion Humanity is forced to accept to coexist with the aliens in order to avoid extinction. Soon enough, an evil plan that involved the aliens is found and Humanity decides to bring back the fight to them and this is where you come in. You play as one of various AIs sent to XO-Planets in order to scavenge resources and wipe out the hybrid alien creatures living there.<br><br><u><b>Visuals &amp; sound:<\/b><\/u><br>In terms of visuals, I think that game looks pretty good. It is certainly not the best pixel art I\u2019ve seen but, when in motion, some of the effects look really cool. Some people will find it appealing while others will despite it, it is up to you.<br><br>As for the sound, I think the music is probably one of the things I enjoyed most when playing the game. The sound effects however, despite sounding rather simple and nothing to be amazed at, they provide some pretty useful auditory feedback as to what is going on, thus making it really easy for tou to realize when you take a hit or hit an enemy, especially when you\u2019re still learning the game.<br><br><u><b>Gameplay overview:<\/b><\/u><br>Before anything else, you start with only one AI and you\u2019ll unlock more as you play the game. Each one of the characters has its own unique set and the game also gives you a little background on each one of them, which helps giving them some character.<br><br>Despite the fact that the game is difficult by nature, one thing that for me makes the game a lot less welcoming to new players is the fact that it has no tutorial, you have to figure out everything for yourself. That said, the gameplay itself is pretty simple to understand once you figure out the controls. Your character has two different weapons besides bombs, a melee weapon (sword, dagger, battle axe, whip) and a ranged weapon (pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle), which you\u2019ll eventually change once you find better ones while playing the game. And, like most platformers, you\u2019ll find yourself jumping a lot of times in order to reach other places, dodge enemies and so on. <br><br>Before you\u2019re thrown into a mission, you\u2019ll get a very short briefing by one of your contacts. Once you\u2019re in a XO-Planet, your objective will always be to defeat a certain boss but you\u2019re also given a secondary objective via email, which might be something like \u201ckill X type of enemies\u201d or \u201ccollect X\u201d. You might also come across these things that look like terminals which, once you activate them, you\u2019ll have to defend them while it downloads some intel for you. After completing these, you can pick up your reward on one of the vending machines that you can find on each level. Besides killing enemies, completing these side activities is a very good way to earn resources. That said, the game resource system is divided into \u201ccomponents\u201d and \u201cxolyrium\u201d. Components can be used to repair drones that you find scattered throughout the levels, build turrets or buy weapons or upgrades at vending machines. On the other hand, xolyrium is much harder to come across and it is most important because it allows you to upgrade your characters once you die, thus providing a permanent progression system which I really enjoy and keeps me playing.<br><br>As for the combat system, it is pretty solid, which combined with a small, yet challenging range of enemy variety keeps things hectic and interesting. When dealing with small groups of the same enemy you can easily get rid of them by just adapting your movement to them, but as soon as the game throws you everything at once, well, good luck with that\u2026 you\u2019ll find yourself jumping franticly and using a combination of your abilities and both your melee and ranged weapons to fight off the hordes of aliens.<br><br>With that in mind, the game does incentive you to go out of your way to explore the levels, other than just rushing the boss. You\u2019ll find these loot chests that can contain resources, weapons, health, bombs or even AI mods (passive and active abilities for your current playthrough) which help make your life a lot easier. One small feature that I really like about this game is the fact that you can activate a \u201cvisor\u201d, which shows you very different kinds of information about your enemies and surroundings (which can be increased by picking up mods) while also changing the look of the level due to some sort of filter, think of it like the terminator visor.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Procedural generated levels and weapon stats - adds more replayability<br><\/li><li>Lovely pixel art style<br><\/li><li>Permanent progression system that makes you want to come back for more<br><\/li><li>Robust combat system<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons:<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Limited video options (no full hd support)<br><\/li><li>Lack of tutorial<br><\/li><li>Some bugs\/glitches - enemies getting stuck on terrain or spawning inside walls<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict:<\/div><b>Despite being in Early Access, the basics are in place and now it\u2019s just a matter of adding more content and refining what is already there.

It is challenging, yet not frustrating, and addicting, which can make you want to go back for more due to the various unlockable characters and the permanent upgrade system.<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23109012', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23109012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23109012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23109012' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23109012\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23109012', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23109012_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23109012_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23281283\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Sfro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"82285242\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adb2ed507c7bd87e61c06a3b8f386b802158aaac.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adb2ed507c7bd87e61c06a3b8f386b802158aaac.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/ad\/adb2ed507c7bd87e61c06a3b8f386b802158aaac_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Sfro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82285242\">Sfro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Sfro\/games\/?tab=all\">594 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Sfro\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Sfro\/recommended\/439730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">23.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while XO-Planets was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">A neat little game full of content and easy to get into<\/div><i><b>TL;DR<\/b> at the end for the lazies<\/i><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\"><b>Time to complete<\/b> 6hrs<br>\n<b>Time to 100%<\/b> 25hrs<b>+<\/b> (farming and luck involved)<br>\n<b>Difficulty<\/b>: [\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1] - Pleasant<br>\n<b>Genre<\/b>: Rogue-Lite, Action Platformer\n<\/blockquote>This game is one full of very varied content to discover and master, and yet is still very straightforward and pleasant to explore.

Great, as if we needed another!&quot; you may be thinking to yourself. And, yeah - I'd agree with you completely. I'm getting a little bored with the whole &quot;permadeath&quot; concept; it's been done dozens and dozens of times to the point that it's getting a little stale. So hey, why not toss in some pretty rainbow blood splatters, a kickass soundtrack, and some run n' gun fun to add some spice to a stagnating genre?<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Breakdown<\/div>It feels a little weird trying to place XO-Planets into any one particular genre, actually. Is it a platformer? A nail-bitingly difficult RPG rogue-like\/lite? Or perhaps just an &quot;action&quot; game, as a sort of catchall. Well, it's pretty much all 3 of those! See, XO-Planets allows you to choose from a variety of unlockable characters, each with their own starting traits and weapons. It then thrusts you into a randomly-generated alien planet and tells you to just &quot;go!&quot; From there, it takes a bunch of running, gunning, stabbing, and slashing to work your way to the bottom of the planet, where a boss awaits.<br><br>Now, it's a little more complicated than that though. First, almost everything is randomly generated of course, from the loot (whether that's one of a few weapons, melee or ranged, or some form of currency to upgrade your character with) to the enemies to even the environment itself, which you can freely destroy using some explosives. On top of that, each planet contains one upgrade shop, a miniboss, a side objective (which could range from simply destroying the terrain to killing a certain number of enemies), and an optional &quot;defend the object&quot; goal. I personally never successfully defended the object (I can't remember its name) because it was both difficult and not necessary at all, so eh, what's the point? There's also towers that you can place occasionally, but they don't seem to be very useful currently.<br><br>Of course, there's also the boss of each planet! Now, initially the bosses made me a little sick. See, they're not disgusting or anything, but when you start fighting one the screen goes all crazy and it just gets unnecessarily disorientating. The screen flashes a little too and the lighting gets a bit weird. I mean, I get it - the game is trying to be trippy. Honestly though, I preferred playing with the light flickering and screen shaking <i>OFF<\/i>, which thankfully there's an option to turn off. For the bosses themselves though, they weren't anything particularly special. I managed to kill most of them with little difficulty once I'd found some good weaponry (I beat the game using a rapid-fire pistol that had incredible knockback and healed me simultaneously which was awesome). The final boss was pretty interesting, but the rest were just mostly frustrating to try and kill. See, with any weapon besides the base weapon, it seemed to me like the knockback on everything was simply crazy. I'd shoot a boss with my gun, take off a tiny bit of their health, and then they'd fly all the way across the screen. This wasn't just with one gun either - it was pretty much all of them. It got to be annoying after a while and made killing bosses take way longer than it'd have needed to. It's a somewhat minor gripe, but definitely something that could (and very well might) be fixed in a future update. (EDIT: Hey! Look at the cons section for more on this)<br><br>Speaking of updates, I think it's particularly noteworthy to mention how great this game's updates are. They come frequently, and not only that, but they also tend to be chock-full of either new additions, key changes, or bug fixes. It's great! For instance, Steam achievements were recently added right before I started playing, and then the game got a huge update adding local co-op while simultaneously improving gun firing (previously you had to stand still while firing a gun, but now you can move while firing). If the developer keeps it up with these fantastic (and frequent!) updates, I think this game may very well turn out to be something very special.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Action-packed &quot;rogue-like\/rogue-lite&quot; platformer with light RPG elements<br><\/li><li>Vibrant yet simultaneously muted visuals (enemies are mostly dark, but attacking them shoots out rainbow blood all over) and solid animations<br><\/li><li>A pumping, energetic electronic soundtrack to rock out to as you kill aliens<br><\/li><li>Decent replayability in the form of unlockable characters, randomized planets, weapons, permanent upgrades, etc.<br><\/li><li>Steam achievements and local co-op<br><\/li><li>Updates (<i>so far at least<\/i>) come out frequently and are usually pretty good<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The game is Early Access right now, so both bugs and crashes are to be expected. I personally experienced a decent amount of bugs and a few rare crashes.<br><\/li><li>The bosses (enemies in particular really but the bosses have the most noticeable impact) take way too much knockback from both melee weapons and most guns; this basically makes boss fights take much longer than they need to. Apparently a recent update may have fixed this, though I didn't notice much of a change. Still though, the devs may reduce the knockback even more!<br><\/li><li>Video options are a bit limited (so far). You can change the resolution and disable\/enable the flickering lights and visual diarrhea that happens when a boss fight occurs (thankfully there's an option to disable it!).<br><\/li><li>The story is a bit hard to follow (though as the game nears a full release I'm sure it'll make more sense and be a bit more polished)<br><\/li><li>There's no tutorial (again, this may be added in the future), though controls are provided.<\/li><\/ul><br>Sure, XO-Planets isn't super innovative. If you've played Risk of Rain, this game is quite similar. Yet, in many ways it still manages to distinguish itself from the competition. The vibrant visuals (for better or for worse), fast-paced, action-packed combat, and overall fun gameplay make this game a blast to play. The frequent and important updates the game has been receiving so far only serve to improve the game in a multitiude of ways, and if the developer keeps it up, this game will turn out to be something special. Even in its current state, XO-Planets is an absolute joy to play, and I'd definitely recommend it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Final Verdict: 7.5\/10<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23133883', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23133883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23133883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23133883' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23133883\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23133883', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23133883_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23133883_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/recommended\/439730\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22711354\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"106557463\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7585e485fb7939a169c142a37e0dabc76615618.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7585e485fb7939a169c142a37e0dabc76615618.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c7585e485fb7939a169c142a37e0dabc76615618_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/\" data-miniprofile=\"106557463\">Deviation<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/games\/?tab=all\">1,126 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/recommended\/\">25 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/deviationtv\/recommended\/439730\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while XO-Planets was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> Before I start the review, those with epilepsy should stay<br>\naway from XO-Planets.

XO-Planets is an Early Access, Indie Action Platformer with Rogue-Lite elements in procedural generation levels, as well as frequent updates (the last update at the time of writing this review was on April 28th, 2016 with many new additions not just bug fixes to the game). The story of XO-Planets takes place billions of miles away from the Earth, in a dystopia between warring factions. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>XO-Planets gives off a very Risk of Rain esque feeling, in fact, when I first played it the very first thought in my mind was &quot;Risk of Rain&quot; , and that thought is in no way a negative one. XO-Planets has many features that differentiate itself from Risk of Rain. For one, the levels as well as the weapons are procedural generated (which is a big plus in my mind) as well as a ton of upgrade opportunities.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div> The art style of XO-Planets is very visually pleasing, however, as previously mentioned, those with Epilepsy should stay away. The art style is pixel art, and is all in dark neon colors. The enemies in XO-Planets are VERY unforgiving, and getting cornered is a death sentence. The XO-Planets soundtrack is in the 8-bit format, is very catchy and does not easily bore you. When you play XO-Planets, you can definitely feel the developer's heart and soul which he or she has obviously poured into the development. <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Developer Recommendations<\/div>The only downsides of the game in my mind are the lack of a tutorial, lack of settings for windowed mode as well as very strange controls, which leave much to be desired. Some people may adapt to the controls easily, but not me. However, those three cons are no reason to turn away from XO-Planets. If you are a fan of rogue-lite, procedural generation, or indie games in general, I would definitely recommend this game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Thoughts<\/div><br>XO-Planets is a great game that I <b>highly<\/b> recommend for those who enjoy indie games. Every playthrough is different and challenging, with different levels, weapons, and monsters.<br><br>Rating:<br>Graphics: 8.0\/10<br>Audio: 7.5\/10<br>Gameplay: 7.8\/10<br>Overall: 7.8\/10<br><br><i>Edit as of 20\/2\/2017 - I have changed the score to better reflect what I thought of the game.<\/i><br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Enjoy the review?

Though its design tenants are conventional (double jumps, simple controls, focus on accurate movement), the application is anything but.<br><br>Enemies are difficult and unforgiving at close range, which would be a great incentive to use the gun, except properly landing shots is itself a challenge. Without a tutorial to explain a few of its nuances, be prepared to stumble through the first few lives working out the timing required to take out lesser enemies before progressing to the boss. This game has the appeal of trial and error, as well as a high difficulty curve who those that want a challenge.<br><br>Ultimately, this game is oozing with creativity from the mind of a talented developer. Despite this, it has unfortunately fallen by the wayside, ignored largely for no reason. <br><br>Plastered in visuals that range from stunning to vision-ruining, and unfettered by the laws of conventional sound design with sounds both satisfying and irritating, its certainly one of the more interesting games I've played aesthetically speaking. Its worth mentioning here that you should take the epilepsy warning very seriously. If you have any history of reactions to flashing lights, avoid this game at all costs. <br><br>It's a strange game, and I recommend it not because its perfect, or even great, but because playing it is a trippy, awkward experience. It's like stumbling through the first kiss; its like dealing with parental disappointment; its like a trip down a road you haven't seen in twenty years. Refreshing, but something's changed.

Feels a lot like risk of rain.  Bubble + anything a lil too op, but on some chars u can't upgrade so not an issue.  Doesn't quite have the item selection risk of rain does but then again its early access.  Also not sure if items even stack\/don't think they do.  Anyways a solid game that with more improvements could be really great.  Crisp controls.  Played well with an xbox controller.

XO-Planets is an side-scrolling rogue-like game combined some rpg elements, platforming and even little tower defence thrown into mix and it works well! Oh. Did i forgot to tell you that this game is hard as hell too (but in a good way).<br><br>You can play single play or co-op and first you choose you AI character and you can also buy permanent upgrades to you characters. Levels are procedually generated (with free terrain destruction) and your mission is to reach the bottom where the boss is. In your way there you must fight monsters with your melee and ranged weapons and do some light platforming to avoid traps and you can use your bombs to destroy terrain freely. You get materials from killing enemies which you can use to buy some upgrades (only lasts for that game) and Xolyriums which can be used to permanently upgrade your AI or buy different kind of turrets which can only be placed in pre-arranged fixed positions. Each planet contains one upgrade shop, miniboss and side objective along the way to bottom. You get random drops of different melee and ranged weapons and you also can get enchantments to them. And this is permadeath so if you die then you are dead.<br><br>Visually game is pretty decent looking with fluidly animated pixel graphics with nice effects. Games soundtrack is also noteworthy since i still get some tunes playing in my head after playing. I experienced few bugs, but nothing big and this is still an EA title so that is to be expected.

While I learned Risk of Rain\u2019s control scheme relatively quickly, XO-Planets has more complex controls in my opinion. I found myself dying over and over again at the start, which was very frustrating (I don\u2019t wish to remember how many times I died to spikes!). Patience and determination are required if you want to play this game. After dying more than 30 times, I felt I had gained a relative understanding of the game\u2019s controls and how to progress without dying in the first 2 minutes. This was due in part to my accidental discovery that one of the only ways to get batteries (the game\u2019s equivalent of life points) was to destroy receptacles that spawn small monsters. This is where I wish there was a more detailed tutorial, or even some hints (although games like these rely on player discovery rather than detailed tutorials). The thing that kept me involved in the game were the RPG elements. There are 9 different weapons to collect and weapon enhancements\/modifications to apply. Another thing that I enjoyed about XO-Planets was the freedom of choice to blow your way through the levels or simply traverse the platforms by jumping. You have explosives that can be used to destroy enemies and the environment alike.
