Each has different goals but all involving trekking across space looking for things and not crashing into a sun. It's full of random items to find and is procedurally generated afresh each time you play.<br><br>It begins in chapter 1 as a laid-back, lonely search for a home planet. Your spaceship follows a compass sentry around the galaxy while raiding derelicts to keep your resources stocked. <br><br>You pass through different biomes in space, each colour-themed, and each spawning different kinds of dangers (and rewards). You can't shoot, but you can dodge enemies and hyperspace away.<br><br>Raiding derelicts is mostly just a button press that may lead to gaining stuff, losing stuff or a mixture of both. Sometimes there's a choice to make.<br><br>As a roguelike it does have permadeath. If you die, you'll need to spend money to buy a decent new ship, although a lot of stuff does carry over: You keep money, XP and any ship upgrades you found. In chapter one, death also means losing your mission progress.<br><br>[Mild spoilers ahead]<br><br>Once you've completed chapter 1, things get more complex. Chapter 2 forces you to explore the galaxy unguided - you need to locate raw material and take it back to your home planet to push the story on and earn ship bonuses. Not being led around by the nose makes this for a satisfying contrast to the first chapter - and if you die, you're allowed to keep all the progress you've made with your home planet. But you still need a new ship.<br><br>Once you finish upgrading that planet, you unlock chapter 3, where the difficulty increases and you have several types of missions to complete instead of one. This chapter introduces different, harder biomes mostly full of things that can hurt you. There are also boss fights!<br><br>I won't spoil the boss fights, but be prepared to have to outthink the bosses without being able to directly attack them.<br><br>Gameplay video:<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=05PxR3uxPQM&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLLvo6-XrH1fnsN8fLgVYT1IQ36JcWG4J9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=05PxR3uxPQM&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLLvo6-XrH1fnsN8fLgVYT1IQ36JcWG4J9<\/a><br><br>Good &amp; bad stuff:<br><br>* The story, atmosphere and graphic style are excellent. It all fits together perfectly. Just be prepared to fiddle with the gfx settings, the scanlines etc aren't for everyone.<br><br>* Be prepared for gnomic poetry floating in space and pop-up ship logs about loneliness. If you find this sort of thing annoying, you're out of luck. <br><br>* You do have a choice of up to 8 different ships to start out in, but you have to pay for most of them. New players may find a vicious circle that when they're doing badly, they'll only have a weak ship to use and will find it hard to grind to get money.<br><br>* Most ship upgrades you find in space only fit to one type of ship, so you can end up with an inventory full of stuff mostly useless to your current game. Luckily, you can earn new items by scrapping a lot of old ones.<br><br>* It's not always clear why the choice you made in some dialogue boxes result in a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; outcome, which can lead to the occasional death that feels unfair. <br><br>* It's a great game for lore hunters and collectible finders. There are legendary items and unique randomly generated items to find, lots of achievements, collectible logs, and items that increase your luck and make hunting easier. You can even personalise your ship with styles, once you've found them.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17629955', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17629955' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17629955\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17629955' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17629955\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17629955', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17629955_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17629955_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18565030\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002877290\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"42611562\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4b\/4b108f496846fb3b466f5ddb6c9ccc1fd14f5f1e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4b\/4b108f496846fb3b466f5ddb6c9ccc1fd14f5f1e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4b\/4b108f496846fb3b466f5ddb6c9ccc1fd14f5f1e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002877290\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42611562\">Mzehn<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002877290\/games\/?tab=all\">211 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002877290\/recommended\/\">33 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002877290\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 19, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStory premise of RymdResa is a bit of a cliche as you see the Earth explodes leaving our astronaut avatar only one hope \u2013 to find a habitable place in the neverending vastness of space. Soon you start to realize that your are probably the only human left alive, and that there is a little chance that you will find a new home in the \u2018Big empty\u2019. As years go by and your resources run low, so does your psyche, burdening you with moral doubts and at times deep poetic conclusions.<br><br>Separated in a three unique chapters, each having a different premise, Rymdresa feels and acts like a true space odyssey. As space you travel through is procedurally generated by means of y and x axis there are literally no bounds to where and how far you can go, and for how long you can try to survive.<br><br>As in any rogue-like game, the basics are difficult to master and take a bit of time to get used to. You gather resources scavenging through celestial bodies and abandoned spacecrafts or picking up particles of astral dust. Well, it\u2019s not exploration as it first comes to mind, as you just need to get close to the objects and click the explore button.<br><br>There are many different upgrades that you can apply to your spacecrafts; maybe you want your shields to be of a higher capacity so you can take a more rigorous punch from space debris or hostile UFOs, or maybe you want more powerful engine to cover more distance faster, or, maybe you just want a whole new ship with different preferences altogether. The RPG-ish style of your inventory immediately lets you know that there is huge amount of upgrades available. <br><br>Weapons are permanently offline as there is no combat in RymdResa, and i\u2019m really glad there isn\u2019t any, because the omnipresent melancholic atmosphere is just as perfect as it is. Actually that\u2019s the thing that stroke me the most from the very start of my adventure. That strange, even bizarre feeling of loneliness and complete separation from some kind of a illusionary safe-zone.<br><br>RymdResa is the most tranquil space rogue-like you will ever play, but so unforgiving at times. With it's unique twist on space exploration and rogue-like features it somehow manages to separate itself from other space exploring titles.<br><br><i>Disclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only<\/i><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com\/2015\/10\/18\/review-rymdresa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >FULL REVIEW<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18565030', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18565030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18565030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18565030' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18565030\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18565030', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18565030_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18565030_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17675786\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daytondoes\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"38125452\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c697f58f19540dbe426444484936789cdf10b65.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c697f58f19540dbe426444484936789cdf10b65.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7c\/7c697f58f19540dbe426444484936789cdf10b65_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daytondoes\/\" data-miniprofile=\"38125452\">Dayton Does \u00af\\_( \u0361\u00b0\u13b2 \u0361\u00b0)_\/\u00af<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daytondoes\/games\/?tab=all\">1,382 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daytondoes\/recommended\/\">49 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/daytondoes\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 23, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRymdResa is not a game I fell in love with immediately. The strange poetic writing, the minimal graphical style, the frictionless navigation of space, and a soundtrack that felt unsettling did little to impress me, until I gave myself over to the experience. This is not a game that will fling obstacles at you, floating through the void of space you will maneuver through planets, asteroids, and satellites in search of resources. RymdResa\u2019s soundtrack slowly won me, as the empty loneliness of space dawned on me. Is RymdResa truly a barren void? Or are there treasures under the surface? It\u2019s time to experience RymdResa.<br><br>The most interesting thing in RymdResa is the differing gameplay modes between the three chapters. The first chapter leads you around by the nose, to 9 random points where you will collect \u201cresources\u201d and \u201cspacepoints\u201d. The second introduces the idea of a home planet, where you will drag a third currency called \u201cmaterials\u201d which will be used to build 9 upgrades. Finally, the third chapter smashes all of your prior experience into what really feels like the pinnacle of the game. There are boss fights and endless peril, and it is the only part of RymdResa that feels like a true game.<br><br>A choice was made between brutalizing the gamer into the ground, or forcing a couple of chapters where you are able to learn through doing in a relaxed environment. Both choices are correct, but the latter is a bit more enjoyable, at least on the surface. The endorphin-rush was considerably less. You must learn the delicate dance of space! Resources will keep your ship afloat and powered, spacepoints will let you buy upgraded ships with a variety of special abilities. From the turtle I used in my review video to an insanely-accelerating racer craft, the variety of ships available is sure to keep you coming back for more. Level-ups will carry over through death, so you will slowly power up your craft and realize your true potential.<br><br>RymdResa is a beauty of a game with tons of items, ships, and customization. The music gets a little eerie at times, but then you look at the void and realize it should feel strange. The lo-fi graphical choice is still not my favorite, but doesn\u2019t truly matter. While I never find myself overly-invested or absorbed in the gameplay, I find myself endlessly wanting to explore that next corner of untouched space. Huge congratulations to Morgondag on a game that is getting a good amount of attentions, for very valid reasons. Thanks so much for the review copy!

This is absolutely true... but it is actually so much more.  It's pixilated poetry.  It's 2015: A Space Awesomity.  It's the game I didn't know I had been waiting for and I get sad when I think about the possibility that I'd have missed it.<br><br>It's a tale of a destroyed Earth and mankind's last hope to colonize a new world.  It won't be an easy journey, and like all epic journeys, there is a heavy price that is paid by our lone cosmonaut. Its told in a simple and effective way via space diaries and it builds an intricate background narrative as you play the game.  Nothing is jammed down your throat in RymdResa.<br><br>Like Asteroids without the lasers; this game is an excellent example that not every game needs violence\/combat to be fun and meaningful. That isn't to say that you are totally defenseless; sharp reflexes and some fun items will go a long way in increasing your survivability.<br><br>Gameplay: <br><br>Procedural World - Exploration is the name of the game and each run is going to be a little different.  Not just in the position of the neat things you'll discover in the vastness of space but each for the 3 Chapters has a different approach to exploration that helps mix things up. <br><br>8 Different Ships - After you beat Chapter 1 with your first ship you'll get many options of new vessels to buy for your next run.  They use starpoints but you'll have plenty to spend on the craft that best suits your playstyle.  You want a tanky Vanadis or maybe a speedy Skadi Cruiser? Or spend a ton of points for the dominating Ragnarok you just unlocked? It's up to your play style; they all have pros and cons and it's a lot of fun taking them all out for a spin.  Some items you collect are ship-specific so putting new gear on your new ride is just gravy.<br><br>Getting Around - Finding a new world to inhabit will not be easy.  Numerous obstacles will keep your ship from good happy success: Asteroids and debris will try to damage your ship, red mines litter the galaxy, huge gravity-rich suns will pull you towards a fiery &amp; instant death, and, just like a true rogue-like, if you interact with a random planet and it penalizes you too many resources you are going to have to start over.  Luckily your ship comes equipped with a sentry that points you in the direction of my main objective keeping you in the action instead of needing to use a map.  There are also scattered stars you will come across that give you star points &amp; XP that you can spend on new ships and such. <br><br>Resource Management - Resources are scarce and essential to your success.  They also act as your life bar and your fuel; you run out and your journey is over.  A lot of the game is stumbling across a moon or derelict spaceship and interacting with it to have an outcome.  Usually your get star points XP) and resources but a bad roll of the RNG and you may lose resources instead.  You also may fail to explore altogether!  This process is all done with a single key press and is a seamless, quick way to try your luck and keep the action moving forward.<br><br>Leveling Up and Skills - Pilot level as you fly through space, survive each year, find random spacedust and complete objectives you'll be gaining Pilot XP to advance your four basic skills;  Exploration (more positive outcomes), Scouring (more items), Technology (allows you to tap into alien technology found randomly in space) and Survival (more found resources) <br><br>These skills, your level and your ship's inventory carry over to new playthroughs so it gives you a feeling that even a bad run is contributing to a better playthrough next time making this a great game for rogue like fans who are less brutal (perma-death may be available in future updates).<br><br>Death -  Dying isn't the end on RymdResa.  So you flew directly into a huge sun on accident, your run will be over and you'll need to purchase a new ship next time but you'll usually be in a better position to win next time around as you keep your levels, skills, inventory and star points.  Still, the fun is playing to win!<br><br>Graphics: <br><br>RymdResa is a fantastic looking pixel game.  While your ships are fairly simple in shape it helps keep you focused on the amazing style of space exploration.  While space feels as vast and empty as you'd expect that makes the various satellites, moons and spaceships you encounter all the more interesting.  I was always admiring how cool some new thing I stumbled upon looked.  Everything is in a muted bluish color (except those friggin' suns) that just makes perfect sense. Really beautiful stuff, all around.<br><br>But your spaceships being simple in shape doesn't mean that there aren't a sizable number of fun customization\/styles you can find and equip to tweak your look slightly. Its not overwhelming but nice to have as it make you feel like your ship gets better visually as well as stat-wise. <br><br>Sound:<br><br>FX: The sound effects are just fine, the sounds of thrusters, alerts and taking damage all work well.<br><br>Music:  By Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs, the music in RymdResa is an excellent fit for the atmosphere.  Spacey, industrial, everything you ever would want without being too abrasive and getting on your nerves.  The music does a fantastic job of setting the mood.  Space is haunting, lonely and dangerous.<br><br>Voice Acting: The poetic parts of this story are other voice acted and done so in such a way that it really makes you feel the helplessness and solitude of space travel.  I love hearing the cosmonaut speak they really speak from the heart.<br><br><br>Levels\/Maps: <br><br>Space is huge. I found this out this the hard way when I jumped in a teleporter and ended up an insurmountable distance from my next objective.  It became a zen coasting back to the main playable area while trying to minimize my resource usage so I didn't end up floating forever in the void.<br><br>Closer to home the game is much more active and dangerous.  Its meant to be played in proximity to your missions and this is where it is really fun; but I was surprised the game didn't automatically fill the dead space with more random stuff when I was on my accidental journey.<br><br>Final Verdict:<br><br>RymdResa is a fantastic game.  Overall it hit all the right spots with a great universe, wonderful visuals and moving music.  Personally it was a perfect game for me as a fan of pixels and sci-fi games; and the fact it could grow into a bigger game in the future is a welcome bit of hope. The only negative to this game is sometimes the space travel goes on for awhile without anything cool spawning; but these zen moments make the activity all the more interesting.  I hope you get a chance to play it, it's a great experience!<br><br><i>Disclaimer: I was provided a copy of RymdResa for review purposes however I was not compensated for my opinions\/recommendation those are my own feelings.<\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17629745', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17629745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17629745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17629745' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17629745\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17629745', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17629745_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17629745_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary18754816\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039153010\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"78887282\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c736528e45c26f480067b7434f1b223d99d848d1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c736528e45c26f480067b7434f1b223d99d848d1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c7\/c736528e45c26f480067b7434f1b223d99d848d1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039153010\/\" data-miniprofile=\"78887282\">Solid<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039153010\/games\/?tab=all\">316 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039153010\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198039153010\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">11.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 29, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou captain a small space ship.  As you go through space and things come up like FTL in real time with random outcomes.  The thing is that your ship's fuel and life are effectively the same.  Additionally gravity has a random and huge effect on you.  The result is you floating through space without the resources to really control what you are doing or what happens to you.  Sometimes you get pulled toward your next objective.  Sometimes, often, you get pulled toward certain death.  One time I spawned, went places, randomly found some really good research, got a bunch of XP, and lived a long and fulfilling life before I died.  One time I spawned, got pulled toward two massive stars, used a lot of fuel to boost away from a gravity pull I could not normally overcome, and instantly died because while boosting you lose all control and can't avoid asteroids in your path.  One time after 10min of play I randomly came upon an event that took away 1000 fuel\/health instantly with no real warning (max starting health is 300).  The only constant is the poetry of a spaceman who is dead inside and will soon be dead outside.<br><br>I like this game because I believe it attains it's own goals; becoming art.  However it also has the habit, for better and worse, of taking the player's time and throwing it away... into a vast endless hypnotic void.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('18754816', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '18754816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary18754816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '18754816' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary18754816\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '18754816', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18754816_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary18754816_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17637363\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/scotchkoreanguy\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"153146534\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/141269af54ff83c5294d2403ca508d118214924b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/141269af54ff83c5294d2403ca508d118214924b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/141269af54ff83c5294d2403ca508d118214924b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/scotchkoreanguy\/\" data-miniprofile=\"153146534\">scotchkoreanguy<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/scotchkoreanguy\/games\/?tab=all\">165 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/scotchkoreanguy\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/scotchkoreanguy\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe poetry of the diary pods is beautiful and often thought-provoking, and they very effectively capture the essence of solitude and desolation. This is not merely a game about wandering through space, this is a compelling story about a cosmonaut who shoulders the responsibility of finding a new home for mankind, and who struggles with a profound loneliness along the way. The voice acting brings the diary pods to life, and adds an emotional power that could never be felt if they were only read. This is immersion done right and it is storytelling of the highest caliber. The diary pods, to me, almost single-handedly elevate this game to the status of art, not simply entertainment.<br><br>Not to mention that the game looks gorgeous, and proves to be an enjoyable challenge. I highly recommend this game if you're in an existential mood.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17637363', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17637363' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17637363\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17637363' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17637363\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17637363', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17637363_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17637363_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23402715\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/49\/495a59e675d4993075f8b850943ec139369f750e_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"194160131\">EdenStarGazer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/games\/?tab=all\">705 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/\">55 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/EdenStarGazer\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 5, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Space Voyages are fueled by Stardust and space diaries are the only conversation, in this Interstellar RPG. <\/div>   RymdResa translates to \u201cSpace Voyage.\u201d If you enjoy poetry and philosophy with your journey through the stars, then this minimalistic asteroid drifter game might be for you. <br><br><b>Story: Castaway in Space <\/b> <br>The narrative begins with the destruction of your world by an asteroid, which is played out in front of your eyes. Then you are left adrift in your rocket-ship among the stars to recount your angst to the darkness of space. The story is wrapped in poetic devices, which are discovered in pieces as you explore various anomalies on your journey. Events are sad, joyful, lonely, and splendidly beautiful in turns; and so goes the poetry to match. <br><br>I bought the game on release day, as I had been waiting for it early for the poetry. Though the achievements were not popping then, I continued to play for awhile for the relaxing music, exploration, and poetry; which was what I was there for to start with. I had been surprised to find the danger element, I guess, considering the relaxing nature of the exploration. But, it all makes sense when you consider the goal of the game is to experience the angst and solitude of being a castaway in space. In space, it has been said; no one can hear you scream. What did I expect? Did I actually think I could float around in space perfectly unharmed? I mean, seriously. Well, I noticed they\u2019ve added a sandbox for just such dreamers like me. But, in returning to the game today after not playing for some time, I noticed the achievies have been fixed. So, though I have progressed no further than the first chapter to date, I look forward to exploring the \u201crest of the story.\u201d<br><br><b>Game Mechanic: Rhyme without Reason<\/b> <br>I hesitate to use the word mechanic here, because in all honesty there is little mechanics of control allowed the player. You point your little ship in the direction the Sentry is aiming. What follows is an amalgam of random events: chance and luck, with a small bit of skill. You navigate carefully around space, only able to exert thrust or not. I\u2019ve tried using my Steam controller to no avail here. The keyboard controls are mostly a complete waste. The best option is to just use the mouse to pilot the ship; left clicking to thrust, and right clicking when you come up on a random anomaly to explore. The random anomaly may kill you instantly or offer you a choice of bonuses. The bonuses may kill you instantly or give you goodies. <br>Collectables include stardust, which is both fuel and health, consumables which offer special abilities and are accessed at will with the number keys, and spaceship parts to upgrade. The upgrade screen has a neat little interface that lets you click and drag found parts onto your ship. But, if you play in a skilled manner, you will probably feel frustrated from the random nature of both the objects that come at you and the luck of the dice roll that the exploration uncovers.  <br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br>*Poetry <br>*Enjoyable soundtrack &amp; Lovely digital art style<br>*Simple mechanics<br>*Large freedom of difficulty choice<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>*Minimalistic Graphics<br>*Random Events <br>*Little player control<br>*Screen Resolution both limited &amp; bugged<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">I recommend RymdResa for gamers who enjoy philosophical poetry and random event exploration in the stars. If you are in it for the game itself, and not too concerned with a rush for the achievements, then you will find the time in space well spent for drifters.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23402715', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23402715' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23402715\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23402715' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23402715\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23402715', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23402715_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23402715_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17666186\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/souldriven\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"64783761\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a1454f7dea931312ad88e8d91d33fa750098fa3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a1454f7dea931312ad88e8d91d33fa750098fa3.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a1454f7dea931312ad88e8d91d33fa750098fa3_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/souldriven\/\" data-miniprofile=\"64783761\">SoulDriven<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/souldriven\/games\/?tab=all\">759 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/souldriven\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/souldriven\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 22, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRymdResa has been described as the world's most relaxing roguelike. That descriptor was enough for me to one, raise an eyebrow and two, quickly see what it was really about. Having started my first run, relaxing wouldn't exactly describe this experience. There was a sense of urgency, lack of control and, a surprising air of hostility. I died within a minute. I tried again and even when taking a more cautious and slowed approach, an asteroid still barreled right into me. I tried again and died within a menu from a pre determined hit to my resources. That's when I realized that the statement was true. It's relaxing if you make it so and go at your own pace but you won't make much progress. It's the peaceful tranquility of a lone existence yet the acceptance of a slow death. That's what this game does so well, it creates an atmosphere of loneliness and quiet contemplation, accentuated by the initial soft piano and stirring audio logs.<br><br>But who has time to think when you suddenly have to reverse course in a instant and wrestle with stopping to avoid that space rock? The game comes alive when you're boosting straight through the gravity well of a sun because you couldn't pull back in time and in doing so, crash through a field of asteroids. Your ship is damaged but you're alive. How about when you're cruising along and suddenly an object 25 times your size comes into view a little too fast for your liking? If anything, the objects should be bigger because it's the most thrilling rush of the game and leads to some awe inspiring moments. It breaks up the banality, you must be alert and pay attention or you're dead.<br><br>The point is space is cruel. Not by design but by nature. Nothing is actively aware or trying to kill you. The point is you have a mission and no matter how hopeless or bleak it seems, it's better than just a-waitin' 'round to die. As a diary log says, just do. The poor guy has suffered enough and no one wants to drift around in a circle for 65 years.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17666186', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17666186' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17666186\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17666186' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17666186\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17666186', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17666186_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17666186_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28481187\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maudish\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"10048379\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a954dadd4ecd08d570c667880a2d6580dc3720c8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a954dadd4ecd08d570c667880a2d6580dc3720c8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a954dadd4ecd08d570c667880a2d6580dc3720c8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maudish\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10048379\">Audish<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maudish\/games\/?tab=all\">1,025 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maudish\/recommended\/\">304 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/maudish\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 19, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI never thought there would be much overlap between the roguelike and chill-in-space-and-look-at-things genres, and yet here we are. Rymd Resa is by far one of the most relaxing roguelike-things I've played, with a lot of drifting through the cosmos and collecting star stuff. That's not to say there's no death, or frustrating ends to promising runs, but it doesn't take much to get past that and into the soothing embrace of eternity.<br><br>Rymd Resa starts pleasantly enough, with a rogue asteroid annihilating your homeworld. Stuck on your dinky starship in the vastness of space, it's up to you to find a new home for yourself and maybe unlock a few secrets of the cosmos while you're at it. The gameplay is very familiar Asteroids-style jetting about but with several extra layers of resources, stats, and items to keep you busy. Most of what you'll be doing at any given time is seeking out and exploring objects in space, while avoiding dangers like rocks, mines, and angry suns.<br><br>There are three chapters to the game, each with very different goals to tackle. The first chapter has you following a trail of signals across the universe, while the second tasks you with finding resources and returning them to your base. The third is a mix of both, with objectives to locate in deep space while also bringing back materials for upgrades. A helpful coordinate system and objective marker (which is actually a small companion ship) keep you from getting too terribly lost in the void as you putter about.<br><br>You're still going to get lost, though, because space is vast and ever-changing. The heavenly bodies of Rymd Resa move quite a bit, with some drifting lazily in the sea of stars and others streaking off into eternity. They're a lot of planets and nebulae and asteroids but also derelict satellites and stations and stranger things like kittens in F-14s. I should say now that this isn't a terribly immersive game, and it gets a lot more mileage out of its chill atmosphere than simulating any sort of actual space.<br><br>Getting near a safe object prompts you to explore it, at which point several different things can happen. You could get Resources, which serve as both your hit points and fuel. You could get Spacepoints, which are spent on unlocking new ships and abilities via research. You could get a bit of poetic dialog that presents you a choice. Or your exploration could fail. Any of those outcomes can also produce a random item, either a consumable that helps you in your journey or a piece of equipment for your ship. There's a pretty broad spread of items to find and equip, which helps give the game a bit more longevity after you complete other upgrades.<br><br>There are also levels to gain and skillpoints to assign and audio logs to find, and these are all welcome additions to keep you exploring space. You'll have plenty of reasons to putter around the stars, exploring and collecting to your heart's content... and then a bit of space junk will come out of nowhere and annihilate you. Rymd Resa has one big flaw, and that's how easy it is to die, at least at first. I mentioned your Resources are your life and your thrust, and the base ship can hold up to 300 points. Well, a rogue asteroid is going to do well over 100 points, so if you've been out exploring for awhile and drift too far the wrong way, or just happen to be in the way of a comet, that run is over. You can even bite it from a particularly unlucky exploration that saps your Resources with no recourse.<br><br>I had a few moments of intense frustration as lovely space journeys ended abruptly and unfairly, and it's all due to how weak your starter ship is. You can unlock better ships with 600 or even 1000 Resources to run with, but this costs Spacepoints and it's NOT a one-time unlock. You're buying that ship for your next run, so you'd better hope it's a good enough run to earn all those Spacepoints and more back. Items and research upgrades can also mitigate these issues, so by the end of the game you should be back to drifting happily through the void. It's just that first hour or so that threatens to disappoint.<br><br>Hopefully you can get past that hurdle because Rymd Resa is an excellent chillout roguelike full of wonders to discover. The simple, high-contrast graphics and the synth soundtrack are perfect for your treks into the unknown, building upon the strange and solitary atmosphere of your quests. There are some pretty poetic audio logs and text that might annoy you if you often find yourself deriding things as pretentious, but I found they added pleasantly to the offbeat presentation. In the end it's a relaxing journey in a colorful, creative galaxy that I find myself just as strangely drawn to.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28481187', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28481187' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28481187\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28481187' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28481187\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28481187', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28481187_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28481187_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17638931\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"123937881\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/25\/2501845086025a9ce83da5c2a5e89be07e634909_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/\" data-miniprofile=\"123937881\">GameDragonZero<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/games\/?tab=all\">89 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/recommended\/\">54 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/GameDragonZero\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 20, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSUMMARY: A strange, relaxing, poetic, journey-based roguelike about a lone traveller in space and his mission to help humanity.  Simple to play, RymdResa manages to be both challenging, interesting, and set a wisftul, lonely mood all at the same time.  Worth it for fans of rougelikes, journey-based games, and people wanting something unusual and atmosphric.<br><br>RymdResa is a bit difficult to describe.  It's a Space Roguelike, where you gradually build up a ship and a pilot (and more) to take on adventures (through much permadeath).  It's also an artistic, moody, journey based game about one lone traveller with a poetic soul, facing the void and a mysterious mission.   An atmospheric roguelike if you will (that's my current term I'm sticking with).<br><br>You start out in a lone ship after the loss of earth, following vague signals to search the galaxy for particular locations.  Your ship is supported by Resources, which you can find by exploring various worlds, ruins, and artifacts or using abilities and equipment.  Running out of resources means death, and as using your engines or hitting a danger (helpfully outlined in red) costs resources, you want to keep them stocked up.<br><br>Travelling will result in random locations coming up, occasional obscure choices, and your character's own poetic observations.  Time passes as well, and every year you may get a new poem, or an incident that changes the game a bit.  <br><br>Your character also gains experience and equipment, both of which carry over between games.  Research pods let you add new features to your ship - and in an intersting rule twist, require time to develop, so researching something simply requires you to play or wait.   Eventually you can construct your ultimate pilot and ship - though it's still going to be tough.<br><br>Adventuring also nets Starpoints, which are spent to respect the character, to purchase new and better ships for that mission only), and so on.  Starpoints also carry over between missions, thankfully.<br><br>Fiinally the loss of a pilot may let you purchase temporary boosts for the next game - use them well.<br><br>The game is divided into three chapters, each of which has different goals and requirements - on top of assorted side quests you can do.  Your strategies and experiences will change as you explore and upgrade  and encounter more of the mysterious tale.<br><br>The game's atmosphere of isolation, drifting, and speculation is maintained by its music, the character's occasional musings, and the strange and surreal universe the character voyages in.  You may encounter a piece of poetry or a few words hanging in the void, or a space station with tentacles.  One area of space may be interted, another with a background of a pulsing star.  RymdResa is it's own surreal cosmos.<br><br>The developers, as of this writing, are also supporting it with new content and quests.  These people really care about their game.<br><br>The simple play, the many options, and the atmospheric presentation combine to make the game both relaxing and challening, both strange and familiar.<br><br>I will note the difficulty curve is going to be different for different players.  Having seen other people's reaction to playing the games, it seems some people take to RymdResa and its easy - for others challenging.  As a guy with a near-supernatural ability to run into things in this game, I was the later.<br><br>Is RymdResa a good game?  Most definitely, it shows true artistic craftsmanship, it's easy to pick up, provides depth, and can really reach you.  I've enjoyed piecing together the story behind my ever-returning lone astronaut - or perhaps I'm just making one up from the pieces of poetry.  The game also has a certain compelling element to it that draws you back.<br><br>Is it for you?  Well, no, it's not for everyone.  It's best for:<br>* If you like Space Roguelikes, flying around and exploring - but also want to relax and not have huge amounts of combat or complex trading routines.<br>* If you like journey\/travel based games but want something more, something to prod you.<br>* If you like experimental games then this is definitely for you.  RymdResa achieves a certain &quot;something&quot; that's worth exploring.  There's something compelling about it.<br>* If you want a game that mixes challenge and relaxation in the right amount - but doesn't hold your hand.<br><br>So make the call.  Perhaps you'll join some of us in the stars, ever-returning, reading cryptic poetry in space as we try to save humanity and ourselves.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17638931', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17638931' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17638931\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17638931' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17638931\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17638931', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17638931_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17638931_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30785819\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198036870249\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"76604521\">Camkitsune<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 39.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is a fine line between being pretentious in a way that's endearing, and being pretentious in a way that's insufferable.<br><br>RymdResa is the former; somehow, floating through an endless void of clip-art, ambient music, and pseudo-poetic snippets whilst being pelted with rocks and occasionally read bits of free-verse by someone who clearly had too much fun with a ring modulator just... works.<br><br>I can't say WHY it works.

I doubt you can have nice time in here without an analogue joystick, the physics model rules.<br><br>You have to be very patient, for the bonuses seem totally random, &amp; I generally suggest playing RymdResa only if you have plenty of free time ahead &amp; you totally don't rush anywhere, for it was clearly made up as a dedicated meditative space (pun intended) for relaxed gamepad gravity dancing accompanied by quality ambient music &amp; vague spiritual sayings.<br><br>I love this game, but there are negatives:<br>1) after some playtime (maybe after alt+tabs, or numerous level ups) the active zones start to slide off the imagery, a couple pixels to the side &amp; down, so that you risk to click another inventory item trying to scrap it, &amp; it progresses, so you have to restart;<br><br>2) only 3 missions you have to replay again &amp; again on different difficulties until you try out all the ships, collect bonuses for them, find all anomalies &amp; get all achievements, how about a little more tasks for the player? - I understand that the spirit of the game is zen's 'not the aim, but the process' in a randomized vastness, yet still.. more contents would be welcome;\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29441095', 'recent_short' );

The boss fights can be tedious since you need to travel back to them each time if you die. There are elements of exploration, and while they are crucial to the start of the game, at end game they aren't really necessary.<br><br>Pros: The soundtrack, storyline, and narration truly sell this game. If you are not interested in these things, the game isn't likely worth picking up. The game is fun and can be challenging. It has several different difficulties for the storyline and a sandbox mode, which allows you to float through space freely and explore without the risk of dying.<br><br>The story mode will take a decent amount of time even if you don't go for the achievments or all the missions.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29075865', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29075865' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29075865\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29075865' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29075865\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29075865', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29075865_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29075865_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28961212\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ronthetech\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"59708421\">Straxter<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI generaly don't like these low graphic games, but I though I give it a chance since it is about space and I love space.

It tries to make you feel calm, and a little lonely - but you can't let your guard down, either. At any moment, something can fly towards you and crush you. It's an interesting experience.<br><br>The game has some issues. There are bugs with use of a controller in the menus. There is no tutorial and learning to play is a little frustrating at times. But if you're someone who enjoys the aesthetic of this game, it's worth playing.<br><br>Detailed video analysis and critique can be found here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qdNMr8eT4cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qdNMr8eT4cc<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28933774', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28933774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28933774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28933774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28933774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28933774', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28933774_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28933774_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28584662\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/playoftheyear\/recommended\/269690\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"76952817\">playoftheyear<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPerpetual Syncopated Complacency\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28584662', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28584662' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28584662\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28584662' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28584662\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28584662', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28584662_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28584662_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/269690\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 220 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["17629955","18565030","17675786","17629745","18754816","17637363","23402715","17666186","28481187","17638931"]}
