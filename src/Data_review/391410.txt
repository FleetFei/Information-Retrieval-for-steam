It's a fun little game that you'll likely beat in not much more than 15 minutes, but it kind of has more fun than it has any right to have.  A level editor would be great, along with more levels.  There's a pretty good game idea here, it's just not fleshed out nearly enough.  No more than a few of the levels are even remotely difficult, but if you just barely beat a level, there is a tense moment or two followed by a smile.  I'd imagine I got this game from a bundle, so it likely didn't cost much, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy my 15 minutes with it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22754420', 'summary' );

is fixxed.<br><br>I was just browsing though my library today I found a game that broke 2 record.<br>1. have 0 positive review and 4 negative review.<br>2. have only 11 MB in size.. <br><br>If my memory serves me right i haven't seen a game that size for 25 years...<br><br>So I decide to give it a try and maybe write a positive reivew to boost status of this game.<br><br>On first glance it's simple menu and decent sound is ok... <br>There is only 1 music i find in menu and in game and it's a pretty good 1 minute repeating mono beat which is actually quite nice to hear.<br><br>Then i try to start the game and that's when it hit me..<br><br>I cannot click on any of the button on the screen. By move mouse around i find if you click on the empty space about 1inch from the button you able to get into the game.<br><br>The concept of this game is actually pretty good.<br>1. you are a rock... (rock of ages comes to mind).<br>2. you roll over trees.. Different trees give you different ablity such as speed up.. slow down.. get bigger.. get smaller.<br>3. each level there are humans.. you roll over them to kill them. <br>4. if you kill them all you win...<br>The controls are fine when you actually in game mode.<br><br>It's quite unique and sounds fun.<br>I was able to finish the learning stage no problem.<br><br>But i cannot click and get into any of the 15 levels that's avaible in this game.<br>The button don't work and this time i search all over the screen and cannot find where to start this game.<br><br>I really want to give this a thumb up as the first thumbs up for this game but until this game menu problem is fixxed i just cannot.<br><br>It's great effect for developer to create such a small game with unique concept but.. Frankly it shouldn't be ready for sell for 5 dollars. Maybe 30 cents if the bug is fixxed. <br><br>Still it should be great learning experience for developer...<br><br>2\/10 at the moment. if i can actually play it i will revise this review.<br><br>Revsion: Was contacted by the developer. It apears this game have scaleing problem right now.<br>After i set this game to be biggest resolution the game is now playable. And i am able to get into individual stage and play the game.<br><br>There arctually 2 object to this game and you have to fulfile both to win each stage. Kill certain number of basic tree and kill certain number of people. About 30 second after you start each stage the world that you are in start getting engolfed by big chunks of rocks and if you touch them you loses.So far the 15 level available in the game is quite well designed actually.. Blue and pink tree together. 1 makes you slower and the other grow your rock.. red\/brown trees together. one make you smaller and one make you faster.. so you want to be fast and big so you have to be very careful.<br><br>I am actually color weak(not blind) but i can still tell those colors good enough so i can play this.ttok me about 1 minute each stage without fail until i reach 9. Then after learning each stage layout and took me another 15 minutes or so to complete the rest of the 6 level.<br><br>Over all it's pretty good entertainment for about half an hour or so.<br><br>Here is the flaw i see in this game so far.<br><br>1. too Basic.. add more different trees with different ablity.<br>2. stage too small.. make it bigger and harder to navigate puzzle instead of square space every time.<br>3. too simple and basic.. it probably more suited for kids 4-8 to first learning computer. <br>4. this game is kids simple so why you make rock run over human? make bad insects or something instead of human would be more game proof for parents.<br>5. This game need highest resolution to make button to function. Why not limit it to just 1 resolution? or just find a way to fix the scaling bug.<br><br>For a 11mb game for effect and I will give this one a passing 5.5\/10 as score.<br>But do not despire.. learn from this game. improve on it and make better games developer. You can do it!<br><br>As of right now the baseline price of over 5$ is a bit high and i recommend you to change it to 1 dollar and maybe add more levels.. trading cards and etc to improve sales.<br><br>I don't however recommend this game to everyone as it's too simple and childish..<br>if you are a parents and you want your kids to learn colors and mouse control. show them this game and teach them.. a little rock crushing violence though but i think there are worse thing then that out there..<br><br>Revised Rating 5.5\/10..\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17991317', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17991317' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17991317\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17991317' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17991317\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17991317', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17991317_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17991317_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/391410\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 8 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22754420","17991317"]}
