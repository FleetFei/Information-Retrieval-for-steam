The combat is extremely well designed. It's fast paced, but also greatly rewards stategic play, quick thinking, and using your environment to your advantage. It's fun, but also takes a great amount of skill. The enemies are challenging, but their attacks are almost always avoidable (with only a few rare exceptions). The difficulty comes from the enemies having interesting and challenging mechanics, not by simply giving them lots of health and damage. Both the player and the enemies die in only a few hits, making the combat about very careful positioning, timing, dodging and strategy, rather than it being about DPS, armor, gear or any stats. In Kill to Collect, when you die, it's because you made a mistake.<br><br>The combat is so good, that despite most other aspects of the game being nothing special, I consider this to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's hard to adequately describe it in words or showcase in a video, you pretty much have to play to understand.<br><br>Other things I like about this game:<br>- The four characters all feel significantly different from each other in their style of fighting, but are all fairly balanced.<br>- It has co-op, while almost every other rogue-lite does not.<br>- Basically no time wasted on dialogue, travelling, sorting items, or anything else boring. You will spend 90% of your time fighting.<br>- The music is good and suits the atmosphere of the game very well, although like all game music, you'll probably want to turn it off eventually.<br>- Daily challenge missions with a leaderboard let you compete with others for daily high scores.<br><br>Things I do not like:<br>- The aim assist. Although necessary for this type of combat (especially for newer players), sometimes it can be a major liability. At this point, I'd say at least a third of the damage I take is aim assist related, and that's a conservative estimate. There needs to be a button to toggle it on or off.<br>- The player base is very small. It can be very hard to find people to play co-op with using the in-game matchmaking. If you want to play co-op, you'll need to have friends, or add people off the forums.<br>- The hit detection is host-side, rather than client-side, making it difficult to play with friends from another region due to lag.<br>- Currently, due to how the difficulty scales, co-op can be significantly harder than solo.<br>- The &quot;Hard&quot; difficulty is exactly the same as normal, except you get only 1 HP. It's definitely hard, but it feels also a bit lazy and causes some balance issues. This problem is not as bad as it sounds though, because most players can't beat normal difficulty.<br>- A couple combinations of enemies, or modifiers on certain randomly-generated bosses, can be a bit unfair or frustrating (or at least feel that way). They are fairly rare though. Example: shielded kamibots, or a boss with heal, damage reflect, shield and super teleport.<br><br>In it's current state, I highly recommend this game.  As a bonus, the developers are still adding to this game. They also read the suggestions people make in the discussions, so hopefully over time the list of things I don't like will shrink!<br><br>If anyone disagrees with anything I've said here, or any information is outdated\/irrelevant, please leave a comment.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22490413', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22490413' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22490413\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22490413' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22490413\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22490413', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22490413_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22490413_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>33 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22285909\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arborday\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"10076641\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/167ba0b285b0e65f33effe20f67354c10b491d37.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/167ba0b285b0e65f33effe20f67354c10b491d37.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/16\/167ba0b285b0e65f33effe20f67354c10b491d37_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arborday\/\" data-miniprofile=\"10076641\">arbor day<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arborday\/games\/?tab=all\">609 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arborday\/recommended\/\">85 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arborday\/recommended\/241760\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 7, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a four player co-op game <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> or a single player game if you are like me and don't have friends<\/span><\/span>, that markets itself as a roguelike, but I'm not so sure I think that's correct. You might be able to get away with calling this a roguelike-lite, or saying it has some roguelike elements I guess, but it sure ain't Nethack or anything close.<br><br>The four playable characters are all a little different, and each have a standard attack, a special attack, and a movement ability. You also have an ultimate power that charges up as you kill things. There's only one of the four that I really don't like, which is fine with me.<br><br>There isn't any leveling up, or long standing character progression. You can earn a currency that you spend to upgrade your character, but the abilities you can pick from are randomly selected and only offer you a pair at a time. These upgrades only last for the current bounty mission you are on, so your character restarts back at square one each time you play. This isn't really an issue, just thought I'd clarify that.<br><br>You can unlock certain kits, which let you give small customization bonuses to your heroes, though. For instance, the medic kit starts you with two medkits. Some kits might start you with a secondary weapon, or various other power ups.<br><br>Each bounty you clear earns you points that go toward unlocking these kits, titles, skins, and various things like that. The overall progress is account wide, not per character, which is nice.<br><br>The game is pretty fun, but I can't speak as to how good the co-op is, because I don't have any friends oh god whats wrong with me.<br><br>I should also say that for whatever reason, this game runs pretty bad on my system. A lot worse than I'd expect. I have everything on the lowest setting, including res and the framerate is pretty awful. I don't know what the deal is, but it might be something on my end.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22285909', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22285909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22285909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22285909' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22285909\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22285909', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22285909_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22285909_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/recommended\/241760\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22761518\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"280596440\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94758468395946f0ce814618dae3054a7b48bc15.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94758468395946f0ce814618dae3054a7b48bc15.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/94\/94758468395946f0ce814618dae3054a7b48bc15_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/\" data-miniprofile=\"280596440\">Metro Retro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/games\/?tab=all\">2,021 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/recommended\/\">97 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/metroretrogaming\/recommended\/241760\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>Kill to collect is a co-op multiplayer (or singleplayer) experience with cyberpunk attributes and some rather interesting and unique level design implemented into each mission of the game. The game is rather fast paced, and focuses upon combat more than anything else in the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Quick Note<\/div>Apparently the game is tagged as Rogue-lite\/like which I don't 100% agree with. The game has some elements of this sort of genre but I wouldn't tag it as that, I know that the tags are made from the most popular by steam users but it's just something I had to say.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>Kill to collect is a fast paced, cyberpunk themed addicting game that concentrates solely on the combat but does well with presenting everything else as well. The combat is elegantly designed which has had a lot of thought and process gone through how every move works.  The combat combines fast paced with quick thinking and strategic play in order to outsmart your enemies and kill them easier, the game doesn't rely on how fast you can spam the attack button which is a very good think to have in a game like this. Because who really likes mashing a button to attack with bare minimum combat system? The environment of the game itself is well thought out and presented, you can actually use this to your advantage to kill your enemies easier and quicker.<br><br>With this sort of combat system, it won't be easy. The game seems to take a lot of skill (especially in single player as all the enemies will walk towards you) which definitely would require you to be able to talk to your other teammates in order to get good at the game and be more strategic with your attacks.<br><br>The difficulty of this game comes from the enemies that you encounter throughout each of the rooms that you go in before you get to the main bounty. Some of the enemies are plain and simple, but as you get further into the game the enemies start to develop a more interesting and challenging mechanics that will make the game a bit more harder for you. But the way that they do this isn't like other games similar to this, they are not given tons of health, damage or defense boosts in order to make it difficult. Both you and the enemies die in a couple of hits, this makes the combat system more difficult and makes you focus more upon timing, dodging and careful positioning of each of your attacks in order to make them the fullest and most effective that they can be. You will know when you have made a mistake, because you will be punished harshly with either death or low health.<br><br>The progression with each of the characters that you play as needs a bit more work. It does feel a bit meh and doesn't really feel like you are progressing in the sort of way that you would expect to do throughout the game. I feel like even though there are only 4 characters in the game, that they could of expanded a bit more on the sort of characters that you could of played as. For me, the first hour of the game was me testing out the characters and what sort of combat style there was, and for me personally they all just felt dull and not really that interesting all together. A few more characters in this game would add to a bit more variety to the game I think.<br><br>The game's graphics are so bright and vibrant, I feel like it brings the game to life and really helps with the fast paced that the game is going for. With the cyberpunk theme it really hits the nail on the head for the game all together. With all the characters being fairly bright and colourful, as well as the walls and everything else in the game it really sets a high standard for the game if you're just watching the trailer to see if you like this game or not.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Elegant combat system<br>+ Fast paced and strategic thinking<br>+ Nice difficulty throughout the game<br>+ Very colourful and vibrant colours<br>+ Steam achievements and trading cards<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- Needs more characters to vary it a bit<br>- Smallest combat mistake could lead to quick death<br>- For the asking price, it's a little steep in my opinion<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Result \/ Final Thoughts<\/div>Kill to collect is well worth your time, even though the game itself may be a bit steep for the current asking price it still does well when it comes to the interesting combat and gameplay.

Fun for a quick romp but disappointed about not having enough friends to play with. Interface, matchmaking, and netcode need a few tweaks.<br><br>Potential: 8\/10 with a solid-buy recommendation if matchmaking gets an overhaul. Once the multiplayer community gets up and running, <br><br>-<br><br>Built on the Unity engine, Kill to Collect is a 1-4 player skill based top-down brawler of sorts with an 80's neon\/cyberpunk theme and music to match. KTC is an action-oriented tactical brawler with a good degree of challenge and a high skill ceiling, button-mashing wont serve you well here. The basic premise of the game is that you (and a group of friends if lucky) delve into futuristic \/ dystopian slums with the goal of hunting a bounty (boss) and clearing the place of its riff-raff. Along the way you will find one-time use heals, shields, powerups, deployables (such as mines), and even swappable ammo-based weapons as you make your way through the floor. At the end of each section you are allowed to take a break in the rec-room and spend some of the chips you've accumulated to buy yourself permanent upgrades, replenish your health and ammo, stock up on items, or purchase a different secondary weapon.<br><br>There are 4 character classes in Kill to Collect, and while they all feel fairly similar, they do each have their own strengths and weaknesses from being a slow-ish and tanky shotgun brawler with a Juggernaut-like ultimate ability to a crazy shock-staffed, jetpack-wearing, turret deploying crowd control character. Each of the four different classes has their own set of abilities that work better or worse against certain enemy types in a Gauntlet-esq manner, but are still similar enough so as to not become obsolete when used in solo play. Due to the nature of these differences, the game really shines in multiplayer when you can combine these with allied abilities, but thanks to a small playerbase, finding a multiplayer game can be quite difficult.<br><br>The brawler-esq 3rd person top-down combat in KTC is broken down into an exceptionally simple set of attacks and moves; A basic attack, a special knock-down attack on a cooldown, an ultimate ability on a kill-based cooldown, and a limited ammo-based interchangeable weapon. Additionally each character has their own dodge ability from a steerable and fast moving jetpack that can be used to knock enemies aside, to a short ranged blink which can teleport to the other side of an enemy (admittedly a bit fiddly), and of course a fairly plain-jane dodgeroll too. The special attacks for each character feel similar, but do impart different effects on the enemy from armor breaking debuffs which make an enemy take more damage on their next hit to stuns and knockdowns which in some cases are only effective against certain types of enemies.<br><br>An upgrade\/unlock system of sorts is in place, but its incredibly simple and very linear. Basically, as you collect bounties (score) from playing and beating levels, you unlock skins and new loadouts which allow you to change the two starting items that you begin the game with. Loadouts are a fairly minor thing overall, but do influence the early-game. Unlocks for golden weapon skins are attained by completing objectives based around using those weapons, but these golden weapons dont appear to have any gameplay impact, nor can these skins be disabled.. so any uniqueness of each weapon's texture\/color is basically lost after you've completed its associated task. Pieces Interactive definitely could have done a bit more with this system while maintaining balance and keeping power-creep at bay. In its current state these systems feel a little under-developed and disappointing. Collected bounty is basically just a measurement of how much you've played.. a global score of sorts; you dont use it to buy unlocks, loadouts, or skins, they just get unlocked when you reach a totally linear and arbitrary amount.<br><br>Ultimately the crippling factor for Kill to Collect at the moment is that its missing its multiplayer community. Its a solid game which needs more players. They've done a really good job with core fighting mechanics and balancing, and aside from a bit of peer-to-peer lag, the multiplayer mechanics feel pretty good. Revive systems are in place to keep the flow of the game going and reward players who are good by keeping them revived or bringing them back after locating or beating special rooms. The increased number of enemies in multiplayer offer additional challenge, and there is plenty of chaos and opportunity to work together to make some fun and exciting things happen based on the game's various knock-back mechanics and ragdoll-physics. If there was a stronger multiplayer community that allowed you to find games whenever you wanted, I feel that this game would offer a significantly higher value for its cost. As it stands, I cannot recommend Kill to Collect at its full price unless you absolutely love this type of game, or have a group of friends to play with. If you enjoyed games like Spiral Knights, then this will probably be something you will find familiar and appealing. Though due to the simple combat mechanics and lack of complex interactions in single player the game can feel a tad samey after awhile, having a friend or two to play with may make all the difference.<br><br>Final thoughts: Pieces Interactive needs to step up their marketing department and get people playing their game. Its a good title that gets put down all too quickly due to the lack of community to engage with. Single player delivers a couple of hours of good challenge while multiplayer offers some exciting, funny, and tensely rewarding moments. Sadly unless your friends own the game, theres almost no chance of finding a random multiplayer pick-up game to join at this time. Kill to Collect is a good game that Id enjoy playing with friends and with random people, sadly it will be difficult to convince friends to buy without an active multiplayer community and with such a flawed matchmaking system in place.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Good visceral core combat mechanics.<br>- Decent player character and enemy variety.<br>- Has single player modes, offers a good challenge.<br>- The kind of game that truly shines when played with friends.<br><br>Cons:<br>- No multiplayer community as of 2016-07-03. Finding a random MP game is impossible.<br>- Cant do anything but sit at the host screen while you wait for someone to join.<br>- Host-side hit detection means that players will feel some lag \/ sluggish feedback.<br>- Cannot disable autoaim for keyboard and mouse controls.<br>- Maxes out GPU clocks, even when minimized and vsynced. (Radeon 7850)<br>- Title is no longer receiving support. No contact or fixes from developers 6+ months.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24076840', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24076840' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24076840\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24076840' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24076840\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24076840', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24076840_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24076840_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26845834\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021913730\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"61648002\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18357aa4bf3cea78a443eeeeb185058094a4c6d5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18357aa4bf3cea78a443eeeeb185058094a4c6d5.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/18\/18357aa4bf3cea78a443eeeeb185058094a4c6d5_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021913730\/\" data-miniprofile=\"61648002\">shugyosha<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021913730\/games\/?tab=all\">336 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021913730\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198021913730\/recommended\/241760\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">50.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 23, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of the forgotten games on steam that are actually really good.

I coud never call this a <i>masterpiece<\/i>, a <i>work of art<\/i>, or stuff like that, becuse this game is something... both small and, as I already said, not really new, but also perfect in what it is.<br>First thing, there's basically no plot, but that isn't a big deal, the setting is well put and straight to the point: It's a cyberpunk world, you are a mercenary, a runner, call it as you like, we want some crooks killed, here's your target, this will be your reward, <b>go get them!<\/b>. And <b>BAM!<\/b> You are in this map, killing things to open the way to your wanted criminal, no wasting of time, just <b>fun<\/b>.<br>It's a top-down shooter with a skill-based gameplay which reminds MOBA games, and it is hard. Marvelously <b>hard<\/b>. When someone says <i>It's hard<\/i> about a top-down shooter you imagine a bullet hell, but this is not the case, the gameplay isn't erratic, everything is clean, solid, and accurate, if you play it at <i>Hard<\/i> difficulty as an enemy hit you, you are basically dead. If you smash the buttons you die, if you don't take care of your positioning you die, if you don't notice a threat you die, if your mom screams something at you, you die. You can use a lot of different tactics to clean a room but when you do a mistake you lose. This will change if you play at <i>Normal<\/i> difficulty, of course, you will have more health and there'll be room for mistakes, so the game allow you to chose the kind of experience you want.<br>Everytime you'll die, you'll have the feeling &quot;I did that mistake&quot; and you'll get better, the game is clean, it's not chaotic, there's no fate involved, no RNG mechanics, the game never cheats, it just requires skill and this makes it such a rewarding experience.<br>This is a roguelite kind of game, when you die you restart, but it's based on short missions, as I said, so you unlock the new mission after completing the previous one, then you can select the mission you want even if you die. Anyway the maps are randomly generated, so it never feels too repetitive to restart a mission. Anyway, it's hard, and after you die, and die, and die multiple times in a row, no matter how hard you tried, it drains your energies, so, speaking about how I feel after some playing, I could want to stop after 2, 3, 4 hours I'm playing... uhm... but maybe it's not strange in any case? By the way, I could want to stop playing this game after some time, but that doesn't last long, this game is something you'll want to come back to.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Conclusions:<\/div>If you are not a bad person and you like chocolate, you will like this game.

It plays like an action rogue-like with tactical movement. The four characters each have interesting abilities and don't feel the same. The game isn't very deep, but it will provide a quick fix for procedurally generated action.

It's basically a cyber punk version of Gauntlet. It's good fun but I strongly recommend roping in a friend to play it. The difficulty curve is so high but the right kind of challenge. It frustrates you just enough to challenge but make you want to come back for more. You guys should definitley give it a go the more people who get it the more online community there will be with it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24047129', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24047129' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24047129\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24047129' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24047129\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24047129', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24047129_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24047129_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short24025951\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198299881228\/recommended\/241760\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"339615500\">DumeeGamer<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 0.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 2, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Kill to Collect for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&quot;I can only conclude that Kill to Collect is an awesome game, that is best played with four friends. If you each pick the right character and coordinate your attacks, your team will be unstoppable. It is possible to play Kill to Collect on your own, but keep in mind that it will be somewhat more challenging as opposed to playing the game with four people. So, however you look at it, Kill to Collect is a very good game; the graphics, the characters, the soundtrack, everything is inspired by 80's cyberpunk and is completely awesome! If you're into coop roguelikes, Kill to Collect is definitely a game you will want to try!&quot;<br><br>For more reviews, event reports and other epic stuff, please visit <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/DumeeGamer.com!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >DumeeGamer.com!<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24025951', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24025951' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short24025951\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24025951' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short24025951\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24025951', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24025951_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short24025951_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/241760\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 125 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22490413","22285909","22761518","24076840","26845834","24165166","26196069","29951421","26687386","24768582"]}
