Those ideas aren't that special on paper, but the strange mix of climactic locations, fitting music and hand-drawn graphics makes this title not only joy to look and hear, but also leave so big impact on the player that after you finish the game you will know that is one of the best indie games out there yet to be recognized by most of gaming community.<br><br>The story is simple, but it is told extremely well by the voice of the main protagonist as you play the game. It starts out interesting, but it ends up strongly heart-touching. The plot is slowly revealed through the game and the next surprise around the corner will be bigger than the former. Also, in my opinion, Naija is one of the best written female characters in video game industry up to date.<br><br>Aquaria is an open world and you must figure out most of the gameplay mechanics all by yourself. Some tactics for beating some bosses are kind of tricky, so this isn't the game for people that are not so fond of the more exploration-oriented games. The start of this game isn't as fast as you would want to, but if you will give it some time you will be hooked straight to the finish. Game is around 12-20 hours long and there are lots of non-mandatory things to find. This is not a small game by any means.<br><br>Aquaria had a bad luck that it came before the Braid's indie games boom. Don't miss this one. It's a powerful gem hidden in the sea.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('7747665', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '7747665' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary7747665\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '7747665' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary7747665\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '7747665', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7747665_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7747665_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary13056278\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"177110720\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5e91c6b8b06ceb36287311e5e789f0dc328b90a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5e91c6b8b06ceb36287311e5e789f0dc328b90a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b5\/b5e91c6b8b06ceb36287311e5e789f0dc328b90a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/\" data-miniprofile=\"177110720\">MakoSipper<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/games\/?tab=all\">5,360 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/recommended\/\">124 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MakoSipper\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">31.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 23, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b><u>Short Verdict<\/u><\/b>: Wow. Aquaria is a stunningly beautiful metroidvania indie game published back in 2007, but it's still a pearl! I literally dove into it from the moment I started and I really had a blast. I'm very thankful to Jaws for not only trading it with me, but also for recommending it. If you like metroidvanias, indie games and pretty 2D graphics, don't miss this one for nothing! Oh, make sure you play it with a controller, since it's a lot better (except menus, which are easier to navigate with a mouse).<br><br><b><u>Pros<\/u><\/b>:<br>Oh, where to start....<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Very interesting mechanic, where you can transform into different forms, each with its specialty and abilities that unlock more and more of the world<br><\/li><li> A HUGE world for you to explore and swim around<br><\/li><li> Has a great, deep story that pushes you to keep going<br><\/li><li> Lots of treasures, costumes, energy boosts, pets, songs, ingredients and food recipes for you to collect<br><\/li><li> I think it's safe to say that its difficulty level is absolutely perfect--not insanely hard, but don't be fooled by the cute graphics, this game is not a walk in the park either<br><\/li><li> Very interesting boss fights--while they depend on your skills, they're first and foremost puzzles<br><\/li><li> Being able to fill the map with customizable markers is not only a great feature, but also necessary if you want to master the game without looking (too much on) FAQs<br><\/li><li> Absolutely gorgeous 2D graphics<br><\/li><li> Awesome BGM with many different great tracks<br><\/li><li> Great voice acting, even if you compare it to mainstream games<br><\/li><li> If you're into it, there are even some interesting mods, mainly Sacrifice (a story-driven prequel) and Labyrinth (a small sequel focused on, you guessed, a labyrinth map)<\/li><\/ul><br><b><u>Cons<\/u><\/b>:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Aquaria's world is so huge it might take a lot of time when you have to backtrack to explore old areas after acquiring new forms\/abilities. There are travel turtles that carry you around (also seahorses you can ride for faster shorter movements), but I think there could've been at least twice as much turtles for a world that size. Also, being able to choose your destiny instead of having to cycle through them would be great.

It\u2019s magical, large and full wonderful things to discover. I have no clue how I got here or why I am the only one besides the normal sea creatures. I am Naija, a beautiful mermaid-like woman, trying to discover the past and find out what happen to everyone else.<br><br>Aquaria is a 2D underwater adventure where you need to recover your past and find out what happen to everyone else. All other intelligent life seems to have been wiped out and you can\u2019t remember anything. What discoveries and treasures will you find on your large adventure?<br><br>You will discover songs that will give you special powers to help you on your journey. You can get one that will shoot like a fire blast, another which will let you swim against strong currents, or one that will let you light up deep dark caverns. You can earn these by fighting bosses or finding them in hidden caves. You will also need to learn recipes that will help heal you and give your powers a boost. These are all found when dropped from defeated enemies or plants you can pop by certain music tones.<br><br>It\u2019s a beautiful world of varieties of sea creatures that range from friendly to violent. Everything looks really colorful and vibrant. The world under the sea is very large and when you think you\u2019ve discovered everything you discovered another huge area. You\u2019ll have plenty of backtracking to find all the hidden secrets in the old-school Metroid style. Get a new power and go back to a previous area to access new areas.<br><br>There wasn\u2019t really any problems with the game in my opinion. I do wish the final fight was a little better but it wasn\u2019t really an issue. I also wish I was able to zoom in on the map a little more as sometimes it was hard to see where I needed to go. Those are minor issues though and never pulled me out of the experience.<br><br>Aquaria is a low priced indie game that is superb and wonderful to play. You have a good story with a twist, beautiful world to explore, fantastic music, and many hours of enjoyment. I sank 24hrs into the game and enjoyed every minute of it. There\u2019s also some mods you can download to add more to the game if you\u2019d like.<br><br>Bear Rating 9.5\/10<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('7987350', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '7987350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary7987350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '7987350' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary7987350\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '7987350', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7987350_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7987350_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19144124\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Twistorian\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"40780727\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a53356645ce60bf423c6186d171974bbc84b5d35.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a53356645ce60bf423c6186d171974bbc84b5d35.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a5\/a53356645ce60bf423c6186d171974bbc84b5d35_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Twistorian\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40780727\">Twistor<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Twistorian\/games\/?tab=all\">6,141 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Twistorian\/recommended\/\">117 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Twistorian\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">20.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 18, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTL;DR: Beautiful medroidvania-style exploration action-adventure in a mysterious aquatic setting with moderate combat system and fresh-feeling story.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">World of wonders<\/div><br><i>Aquaria<\/i> is a hidden yet rough gem: it's got a beautiful shell that sweeps your legs off, overwhelms you with its enormous world and then drowns you in to its wonderful setting. Frankly, I was unaware it even existed before I started seriously playing through my Library to discover just hidden gems like this. I wonder how it could have flown under my radar for so long. On with the review:<br><br>In <i>Aquaria<\/i> you play as Naija, a barely feral humanoid sea creature with magic singing powers and vague memory of her earlier life. Curiosity gets hold of her and she heads to the outside world to see its wonders. The world proves to be both a beautiful and a grim place. <i>Aquaria<\/i> plays like a medroidvania but (almost) entirely in an aquatic environment, thus requiring none of the usual platforming skills.<br><br>For starters, the game is astonishingly beautiful, in both cut scenes and in-game. Aquatic environment is a tranquil place, full of weeds, plants and critters, many of them malicious. Soundtrack is nice and fits the theme marvellously. Voice acting is surprisingly good for a game with (almost) only the lonesome main character articulating by herself. It is used excellently to set the mood of mystery and wonder. The game encourages you to just hang around in its calm, alien world. Sometimes, an eerie, malicious laughter in the distance breaks the illusion of tranquility - who is that and why is he laughing?<br><br>Just about everything about the storyline and setting is tightly knitted into the lore and many things only become clear close to the end. The intro cut scene itself is confusing as its significance only becomes apparent late into the game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">So much to see...<\/div><br>In the beginning a while is spent simply exploring the limited area and trying to figure out what to do. The ever-present exploration aspect is both cool and dull: while the environment is pretty and contains a lot of interesting features and stuff to find, the whole scope of it is initially overwhelming. It takes a while to get through the slow start. Fortunately there's a map and you can easily mark interesting\/unreachable areas.<br><br>Like expected in a good medroidvania, it takes a while to find out how to use the environmental features to your advantage and find a means to proceed into the areas previously unreachable. This makes returning to the known areas rewarding.<br><br>To reach those areas Naija may learn to take different forms that grant her special abilities like shooting homing fire bolts or fitting into tight spaces. The forms (and a couple of spells) are accessed through singing magic, though there are keyboard shortcuts for the numerous forms. The special abilities are used also in combat.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">So much to fight...<\/div><br>Fighting is simple, almost to a point of dull: shoot until enemy dies, sometimes removing\/destroying the shield first, and avoid getting hit by projectiles or touched by enemies. It works but it sure could use some twists. The enemies are invariably sea creatures of various kinds but bosses are sea monsters or downright fallen gods of enormous size.<br><br>Boss monsters (which are a dozen) usually require one to make them expose their weak spot in some way and then shooting it as fast as you can. In effect fighting some bosses is more like a puzzle into itself as you look for their weak spot and study their attack patterns, which are just 2-3 per boss. Many bosses have also a fascinating background in the lore, though some are just nasty creatures who want to kill you.<br><br>The later bosses are better and more challenging (even difficult), while the earlier ones might be killed simply by dodging or blocking their bullet storm-like attacks and shooting like a madman. The later bosses may take several tries to survive, especially the final boss who has several forms and no saves between.<br><br>The scarcity of save points is a major fault: with the long distances between areas and the menacing world one would hope for frequent saves but there's usually just one per area. While death does not happen too often, when you do die you lose all progress since the last save, which can be infuriating if it was a while back. It also forces for rather long game sessions since you don't always know when you can save the next time. Food crafting, i.e. cooking, can be used to create healing and buff items that can sometimes help through the most dangerous situations to avoid losing progress.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">It's not a perfect place<\/div><br>The world of <i>Aquaria<\/i> is an enormous place with several biomes from amazing reed forests to fallen aquatic cities to pitch-dark caves. Several times I would just stop momentarily and enjoy the marvellous vista.<br><br>While mostly placed underwater, there are a couple of less-than traditional platforming sections later into the game. Wall-jumping is unfortunately way unreliable, especially since the same mechanic is used to travel on land. There's no way (that I could see) to control the strength of the pounces, making it hard to judge where Naija would land. Good news is that these sections are mostly optional and sparse.<br><br>Another qualm but a stupid one at that: it took me over an hour to get the first achievement, granted for reaching open waters. <i>Aquaria<\/i> could well have been more generous with achievements, especially in the beginning but also at the end, where you e.g. don't get one for beating the game or seeing the secret ending.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Yet it is graceful<\/div><br>Nevertheless, after 20 hours I had completed the game and found all the secrets, though a few treasures remain hidden (why no cheevo for collecting them all?). Game had three instances where I unfortunately needed to use a walkthrough because I had totally missed the sheer existence of the puzzle despite them hiding in plain sight.<br><br>To be fair in two of the cases I felt like a fool afterwards for missing them. Perhaps in a less hectic age I would have had the patience to loiter around and eventually figure them out myself. The third one, however, was well put by the guide I read as &quot;one of the least obvious puzzles ever&quot; and I doubt I would have ever come across its solution except by sheer accident.<br><br>The atmosphere was tranquil throughout and I found myself being relaxed in all but the tensest of situations. The storyline (with the secret ending) was surprisingly grim and contains a cliffhanger. Unfortunately, a true sequel is unlikely since the devs have gone their separate ways, but the mod community is producing <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.bit-blot.com\/forum\/index.php?topic=4349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >a spiritual sequel<\/a>.<br><br>Reminiscent of some beautiful adventure games of old, after the slow start I enjoyed it tremendously despite its flaws. I encountered only a couple of crashes during the whole playthrough, both after several hours of playing. Game has aged well (being 8 years old at the moment). Though there are good sales for it one might even get it for its current full price (10 \u20ac) - it is only a shame it doesn't have Cards since I would gladly create a badge to show my support.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19144124', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19144124' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19144124\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19144124' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19144124\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19144124', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19144124_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19144124_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14778414\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"54715023\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a695213a8caf5391e8c4592e8564b59de13b79.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a695213a8caf5391e8c4592e8564b59de13b79.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/19\/19a695213a8caf5391e8c4592e8564b59de13b79_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/\" data-miniprofile=\"54715023\">Joey245<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/games\/?tab=all\">250 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/recommended\/\">10 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198014980751\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 7, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI know it says I've only played 15 hours on steam, but that's because I only bought the steam version recently(ish). The truth is, this is my favorite indie game of all time. Minecraft, Gone Home, Bastion, Transistor...nothing can compare to how falling in love with this game felt when I was a young lad. <br><br>The User-defined tags should tell you everything you need to know about the gameplay: Metroidvania-styled level design, 2D underwater adventure, the works. But that's not why I love this game so much. This game is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. From its hand-painted graphics to its organic sounding music, from its triumphant title screen to its emotional ending, from the belly of the whale to the top of the Veil, from its simple controls to its hidden depths, from its quiet emotional moments to its larger-than-life boss battles...everything about this game stirs something within me, something that no game has really ever managed to reach before or since.<br><br>If you're jaded about the glut of early access ZombieSim Survivorsims, artsy-fartsy walking around simulators, blocky beep-boop bullet hell shooters that anyone could make, you owe it to yourself to play Aquaria. It's a shining gem of a game, one that holds the true worth of independent game development. <br><br>Oh, and you can make soup and hand rolls underwater.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14778414', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14778414' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14778414\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14778414' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14778414\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14778414', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14778414_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14778414_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15340503\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/quintlindwurm\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"73862747\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5c\/5c38c4e3edf77b17f4d95de6f57f2b4502da6dbb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5c\/5c38c4e3edf77b17f4d95de6f57f2b4502da6dbb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5c\/5c38c4e3edf77b17f4d95de6f57f2b4502da6dbb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/quintlindwurm\/\" data-miniprofile=\"73862747\">Quint the Glowing Bitter Oyster<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/quintlindwurm\/games\/?tab=all\">525 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/quintlindwurm\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/quintlindwurm\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">38.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA quite expansive underwater adventure, with a gameplay emphasis on exploration, and an aesthetic focus on atmospherics, which are done very, very well.  You play as a lone character who seeks to uncover the truth about her past and the secrets of the world around her.  Her characteristic ability is being able to sing magical songs that grant her abilities.<br><br>The game is very well-designed under the vein of letting the you, the player, figure things out on your own, and make your own discoveries.  There are many features that are not outright explained, but are revealed to you if you wish to discover them, and this includes both narrative and gameplay features (e.g. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>decoding the Aquarian script, and riding seahorses<\/span><\/span>).  This arrangement fits very well with the narrative.  The game also works well as a pick-up-and-play experience, with little needed in the way of previous genre or gameplay experience, which is nice (and also fits with  this of gradual discovery).<br><br>The narrative, a story about gradual discovery of the past, the truth, and the meaning of one's own life, is also very nice.  It's not too wordy, which is appropriate for a story like this one that's introspective.  I felt the story was a little weak at the end, but the music and art made up for it.  In any case, the game serves well the principle of &quot;show, don't tell&quot;.<br><br>The soundtrack is very brilliant, beautiful, and memorable.  For music theory geeks like me, it may be a little sparse on diversity of tonalities, but there's a reason for that, and that's to make the music match up to the singable tones.  Fun fact: if you can recognize keys, you might also catch when Naija sings different tones.  For another fun activity, pick out the leitmotifs.<br><br>The art is very detailed, and also very beautiful.  Most of the areas are simply gorgeous to look at.  You might even find yourself sitting on a chair or a rock and taking in the scenery and soundtrack.  Character animations may be a tiny bit stiff at times, but that is a negligible issue considering the sheer beauty of the art.  It unfolds like a fairy tale...<br><br>For those of you who feel that there ought to be some more combat in the game -- well, there certainly is; one of the earliest abilities you get is a combat ability, and there are certainly many enemies to fight later on, including several pretty difficult bosses.  Though you may find yourself asking philosophical questions about the role of combat, as I did...<br><br>There's also an item crafting system wherein you can &quot;cook&quot; ingredients to get food items that can do healing or temporarily boost abilities.  It's also quite extensive, and has many opportunities for discovery through experimentation if you're interested in that.<br><br>Backtracking in this game is a little tedious at times, but you later on get abilities that allow faster movement, so I suggest waiting on backtracking until you get those.  Keep in mind that the map allows you to set multiple colored markers indicating features that you'd like to return to -- which is a really, really nice thing that I actually haven't yet seen another metroidvania game do.<br><br>TL;DR much to explore, much to discovery, brilliant top-notch atmospherics.  Definitely recommended.<br><br>(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Humble Introversion Bundle.)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15340503', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15340503' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15340503\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15340503' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15340503\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15340503', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15340503_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15340503_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary8953526\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"9152245\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fc9ec734dfebdcb3203170629ab98728e9ab509a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fc9ec734dfebdcb3203170629ab98728e9ab509a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fc\/fc9ec734dfebdcb3203170629ab98728e9ab509a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/\" data-miniprofile=\"9152245\">Chris Fifty-Two<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/games\/?tab=all\">1,965 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/recommended\/\">52 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Chris52\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">26.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 2, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a game I am very torn about. Its one of the most polished indie games I owned and among the most well thought out  2d metroidvania games I have played. It has a great soundtrack and overall great sounds and voice acting and a solid story. Most things about this game just feel right but yet I have a hard time loving the game. Its addictive and hard to put away but might have been its underwater setting or main character that simply didn't work for me fully. I still think its a game everyone should at least try since if this is the kind of game you'd like it might be among the better gaming experiences in its genre.<br><br>The achievements follow the design of the game and are a lot about exploring and experiencing as much of the game as possible along with the common progression stuff. The two big achievements you need to keep in mind is the achievement for exploring <b>all<\/b> areas of the game and learning all recipes of the game. I'd recommend working on both from the start since otherwise you will be on a very long hunt at the end of the game to figure out what you missed (I did this, and it took me ages to narrow down what I needed).<br><br><b>Time to 100%:<\/b> 15-20 hours\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('8953526', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '8953526' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary8953526\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '8953526' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary8953526\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '8953526', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8953526_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary8953526_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15807099\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"7535354\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d936766fa2a1710f710bf685ab30c802ab0c58a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d936766fa2a1710f710bf685ab30c802ab0c58a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/4d\/4d936766fa2a1710f710bf685ab30c802ab0c58a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/\" data-miniprofile=\"7535354\">strangemodule<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/games\/?tab=all\">376 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/recommended\/\">36 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/strangemodule\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">12.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 12, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS**<br><br>Flawed. This game is flawed as hell. Aquaria does a lot of things excellently, but also flounders on principle gameplay mechanics. For these reasons, I find it very difficult to decide if I want to give this game a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down. <br><br>Ultimately, I will say Yes to recommending this game, but before you buy this, you need to ask yourself a few things. Do you enjoy the Metroidvania subgenre? Would you get great enjoyment out of exploration and appreciating the varied and well-done aesthetics? Would this enjoyment mean you could tolerate very long travel times between places you need to be while doing simplistic, shallow combat? If this sounds appealing to you, then buy Aquaria. $10 is a bargain.<br><br>Alright, down to the specifics.<br><br>I'll start with what I liked about the game, which is primarily the aesthetics. Aquaria, bar none, blows every other game I've ever played in my 20+ years of playing games out of the water when it comes to underwater levels. The game boasts a huge variety of marine biology, both plant and animal life. Each major area of the game has its own unique feel and theme, with unique sealife to match. I don't think I can recall any enemies that looked like an iterative version of an earlier one, even if some enemy's behaviors are similar. This game simply wows when it comes to the underwater places you'll go.<br><br>The music, while not quite the best I've heard for an indie game, gets the job done nicely. Each track is pleasant to listen to and generally fits the theme of the area you're in, even if they can be a bit too upbeat at times. Boss battle music feels a bit too quiet, but it's not the worst I've heard.<br><br>Naija, voiced by Jenna Sharpe, impressed me with her consistently good voice work for the game. Although the majority of the lines involve the main character talking to herself, she puts forth enough emotion to stop from sounding bored, and gives enough conviction to the more stressful moments for Naija to sound believable. Considering how bad many video games' voice acting is, this voicework was a breath of fresh air.<br><br>Unfortunately, Aquaria frustrated me when it came down to its gameplay mechanics, or at least the &quot;feel&quot; of them. The game, being a Metroidvania, primarily involves exploring and fighting things. Neither of these felt great to me, and it's for a few specific reasons.<br><br>Exploring the game's areas, as well as figuring out where to go, became tedious for me quickly and didn't really stop until the end. Aquaria, like many games in its subgenre, doesn't tell you exactly where to go next. Naturally, that means both wandering and using process-of-eliminiation to find your next desination, and those are big draws to playing games like these. However, this game makes those very tedious to go through due to both the huge size of the zones as well as the twisty, maze-like caverns that connect them. The minimap zooms in too much to the map, so I had to keep reopening my main map in order to not get lost. Furthermore, many times I sighed in frustration as I realized I'd have to cross a huge, enemy-filled zone in order to check if one spot on my map would lead me to somewhere relevant.<br><br>Normally, this wouldn't be too big an issue, if the game provided fast travel. Well, Aquaria does, but it involves finding turtles who will take you to another turtle's position, and you have to find at least two of these spots before you can use it. The turtles are spread few and far between, and often off the beaten path of a zone. Therefore, there may as well not be any fast travel present for the majority of one's time in the game.<br><br>As for the combat, unfortunately I found it lukewarm. Early on you get the ability to shoot lasers at enemies, but enemies have so much health that swimming past them is typically a better solution. This gets especially annoying when you have to deal with enemies whose projectiles chase you down until you do a 180 so they disappear or crash into the wall, or have enemies who will chase you down and can actually keep up with you. Combine that with the game's lack of health items early on and it's very annoying. As a side note, using said ability doesn't really feel nice either. The attack has a very quiet noise, and enemies simply disappear when they die. It's not very satisfying at all. <br><br>The one exception to this I have is during some boss battles. Although most bosses are puzzle bosses (where you have to do a certain action to do damage to the boss), the all-out combat bosses were pretty fun! They felt like a bullet hell or SHMUP that involved both shooting endless amounts of projectiles at the enemy while dodging their deadly attacks. Honestly, it got quite intense and I enjoyed those moments a lot.<br><br>The other boss battles though...it depends. As I said above, the other ones are primarily puzzle bosses, which means they challenge you to figure out how to damage the boss or make it vulnerable to attack. No spoilers on this, but the bosses ranged from &quot;I had to think about this for a few minutes&quot; to &quot;how in the world am I supposed to figure that out?&quot;. Have no shame if you need a walkthrough for these, as the clues for what to do on them are very vague.<br><br>Granted, I say all these things as someone who doesn't typically play Metroidvanias. Considering the high amount of positive reviews this game has, I imagine people haven't found these to be as serious issues as I, or disagree with my interpretation of them. Regardless, please note that if you buy Aquaria, you're going to be going into it for the atompshere and exploration, and the combat is mostly passable.<br><br>In the end, I'd say if you find the game interesting and you enjoy Metroidvanias, I'd say try it. Perhaps this game is not my typical &quot;cup of tea&quot;, as the phrase goes.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15807099', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15807099' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15807099\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15807099' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15807099\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15807099', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15807099_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15807099_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30890401\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198325370694\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"365104966\">SalaiRoluk<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 8.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI played this game when it first came out on the iPad many years ago, and I absolutely loved the game from start to finish.

It's an easy and useful way to write off having to explain everything to the player through their character but it can make wrapping up the story far more troublesome in the end. Aquaria starts you out in just this way, with an amnesiac protagonist coming to learn about herself and her world. What I didn't expect was how effectively the game could surprise me, moreso than it did its own character. If you want the full experience of discovering Aquaria's world yourself, stop reading right now and get it. I assure you it's worth it.<br><br>You take on the role of Naija, a pleasant little fish lady all alone in her corner of the ocean for reasons even she does not know. An auspicious event causes strange memories to come flooding back to her, starting her on an epic journey through the seas of Aquaria. I won't spoil what she finds but lost civilizations and mystical enigmas are definitely in the cards, along with a boatload of clever powers. There are monsters to battle, beings to befriend, and no end of secrets to uncover in your quest.<br><br>When I say &quot;epic&quot; I'm not just overusing the word. Aquaria is built like a metroidvania, with a wide-open map gated by the many powers you'll gain as you progress. But just like the actual oceans, this map is absolutely enormous, almost prohibitively so. Each region of the waters is a network of maps that stretch far and wide, featuring undersea caverns, canyons, islands, peaks, and clefts. Hidden in these vast locations are items to scrounge up, enemies to battle, and passages into the many places you need to explore to get anywhere in this game. And the powers you gain to access these places are dramatic and transformative, utilized through a clever musical mechanic where you sing songs Ocarina of Time-style.<br><br>With all this facing me as I took my first steps (strokes?), I was fairly lost in Aquaria for the first hour or two. The starting region is decent about leading you to your first few powers but once you move on from there the ocean appears just that, an endless ocean of secrets and possibilities. Aquaria feels pretty aimless most of the time because of this and also because the story is told in brief snippets of monologue from Naija, who doesn't know a damn thing more about what's going on than you do. Finding your next power to proceed is going to take a lot of wandering and exploring and experimenting and backtracking, and that means a fair bit of patience if traversing the world doesn't grab you.<br><br>I wager it will grab you, though, thanks to the wonderful attention to details here. Naija's world comes alive with all kinds of colorful sea creatures, from tiny anemones to massive sea stars, harmless guppies to deadly nautiluses. Despite the slow and peaceful start to the game there are a ton of enemies to battle, with some areas needing to be cleared of hostiles before you can effectively proceed. You do get some very cool powers to deal with them, of course, and those powers can be used to turn up ingredients for the game's cooking system (which makes helpful healing and buff items) or artifacts (for decorating your lovely sea home).<br><br>The graphics propping all this up are simple but charming and have plenty of detail where they need them most. The sound design, though, my God this game has a magnificent soundtrack. Once you get out into the world you're sure to come across a region you never want to leave because of how enthralling its theme is. And while there aren't as many effects as you might expect, the ones there are do a lot to maintain the atmosphere of the deep seas. There's so much to see and do in Aquaria, including a wealth of unexpected elements I haven't even touched on, that you're sure to find something to hook you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30243506', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30243506' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30243506\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30243506' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30243506\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30243506', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30243506_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30243506_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29931942\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197974820306\/recommended\/24420\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"14554578\">Cyrion<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 1.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game has a metroidvania tag and it is both true and false, to me a metroidvania game is a game that focus on killing enemy, exploring to get upgrade and key(or anything that act as a key) with a minimalist story, but this game instead focus on story telling, puzzle solving, exploration to get upgrade and key and information to solve puzzle and not many combat.<br><br>Also in this game you need to &quot;sing\/play(in a musical way)&quot; your special ability\/attack, so fighting can be tricky with all that dodging while pressing the button or key in the right other to activate the ability.<br><br>Not really my thing but it seem to be really well done.

Rebind keys--TYVM.<br>Everywhere you go, you can kill most any fish, which will drop an item 40% of the time.<br><br>Instead of different weapons, you morph into different &quot;Forms&quot; which have their individual uses. For most the game, I stayed in Energy Form to blast any fish. I never used Beast Form to devour.  I explored and completed the entire game without using hardly any of the booster items except an occassional heal.  For endgame, I would suggest looking up the Jelly costume for its self-heal to 1\/2 full when in your docile, non-attack, Song Form.  Of course, to acquire this costume, I had to kill the Jellyfish boss--tough to do without waiting to acquire all 8 Forms. For end boss, I used a few Defense boosters +2, Energy booster +1.<br><br>There are just so many little secrets that it is very tempting to start using a Walkthrough Guide halfway through the game to ensure that you do not miss anything.  In hindsight, I believe you could push forward without a Guide and simply return later for a second walkthrough to pick up a few missing pieces--but you know the backtrack\/repeat frustration. &quot;I already did this.&quot;<br><br>9\/10 Lovely to play.  No flaws.

Being an indie title is one of the oldest of the genre and it was realeased much before Braid which is considered a game that launched wide a boom of independently-developed video games since 2008 and onward. Whatsoever Aquaria is absolutely marvelous game all the way! Thanks for its excelent gameplay design and classic colorful graphical design - years have threated it very well.   <br><br>Story tells about Naija, a female, humanoid sea creature who suffers from amnesia. She wakes up alone in the submarine cave unaware about her wherebouts, family or friends and thus she starts an adventure where she will meet many dangers, discover secrets and find her love. I really loved that the story is narrated from protogonist part of view by future Naija, which voice over Jenna Sharpe makes her job well. Every now and then there is well set cutscenes consisting animations and art, telling that what caused the disaster of the civilizations that inhabited the lands of Aquaria and what's Naija's pupose and destiny in this.<br><br>Having Metroidvaniaish gameplay the player is not be able to explore everything at the beggining of the game, until specific spells have been learned, in this case they are songs. The first hour can cause frustration for Naija is completly helpless and moving is very limited. Everything will change nevertheless when the first songs are collected. Casting.. I mean singing system is very easy to learn and use - different songs consist 3 or 4 different tones that must be picked in correct order and in real time from the circular menu. The different songs are swiftly sang, which makes it easy to change from normal form into fighting form when needed. In addition of normal and infernous flame throwing fighting form there is also a form that allows jumping higher and reaching areas much above the surface. There is also an fish form which is good in long travels for its speed and player can squeeze through narrowest tunnels which would be impossible in any other form. <br><br>Most of the areas are passed automatically during playthrough, but there is some corners in the ocean that hold treasures inside and it's up to player to find or leave them. These trophies are usually leisure items for Naija's home decoration, but they can also be skill boosting armors or artifacts, even new songs!<br><br>The world of Aquaria is a beautiful and diverse place. Enviroments change from coral reefs to underground ruins and from the deepest dark abysses to sandy shores beyond surface. When the enviroments change so do the creatures inhabiting them and while some places can be full of harmony and life there also lies some extreme dangers in the deepest caves of the abyss. There is also plenty boss battles that are challenging and well designed, having that classic puzzle element in them. <br><br>While it is a shame that there is not specific RPG elements, the cooking system provides some conpensation. During playtrough the different receipes can be collected for making various dishes from many ingredients found from enemies and enviroment. They have many effects like upgrading speed, making attacks stronger, enchancing light radius in dark places or just simply healing, which also happens by interacting with red crystals or collecting blue energy. Some ingredients are harder to find and it is recommended to use rare dishes only when you really need them - in boss fights for example. If one should run low in ingredients it is always possible to grind them by exploring resourceful areas again, but this never happened to me. The game is not one of the most challenging that I have played, but not nearly the easiest either.<br><br>In conclusion Aquaria is a real shining pearl in the game ocean of Steam. Excluding the clumsy land controls and lack of RPG features it is really hard to find anything bad about it and it bothers me that this never might get a seaquel which it would deserve. Aquaria really was ahed of its time in both good and bad and while it gathered good reception among critics it did not sell too well in their web store. I really think that if this was released now with better marketing it could be a hit who knows.
