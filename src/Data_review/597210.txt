How did you get here? Where is your boat? Explore to find various odd ball characters and items to find out.<br><br>As you talk to the other residents, learning that this island is named Bayou Island, you learn what goes on in the first area. Everyone here seemed to have washed up on the shore not knowing how they could of. There is also a correlation with boats disappearing as well. However Chris is a different story, having another passenger with him.<br><br>There is not much ways to grab hold onto the plot, as a lot is mysterious and questioning, especially the ending twist. As the price tag suggests, Bayou Island is a short. But the second half seems rushed compared to the first half, especially how the ending is so abrupt. There are a lot of questions other<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>With the ease of point and click mechanics, it is very easy to play. A wheel of options shows what you can possibly do. The only thing you might have to get used to is selecting the &quot;use item&quot; before clicking on an item. With the game's short stay I was not able to remember to use it every time, but I do see why it was made like that. Combining items is used by dragging an item to another so perhaps it was to not confuse the game.<br><br>On the puzzle side most of them were easy, taking no time at all. Some requiring you to just talk with the residents as the others needs items that are just laying around for anyone to steal. One had you playing an instrument, but it did not make sense what the character did in result of it. I do know that if you play an instrument behind someone inside a building, it will sound like it's inside the building. Not outside, especially when the person saw you coming inside. Other than this, another puzzle did not make sense at all. It is a combination but getting it is full of red herrings. It's not something obvious, it's not something based on the amount of certain items (which I initially thought), but based on time. With the descriptions of the objects not being useful till now, it's very weird considering the clue you get. The main red herring seems to be for something else that was originally planned but was scrapped.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div>The music accompanying each area goes well with the surroundings. The music in the Day of the Dead store, and the area behind it, has a Latin flare to it. Making it seem like Chris did get washed up on the Day of the Dead, which is possible but no decorations are shown outside of the shop.<br><br>The voice acting can be better. There are some that did well, such as the bartender, but the one for Chris is not as much. Sometimes it gives off a sarcastic tone while other times he pauses where it seems it should not. There are parts where it works of course, but not throughout the whole piece.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Art Style<\/div>The art style is pleasant to look at, with the Day of the Dead area is the best. Backgrounds having some sort of color pallet depending where the area might be. While they do tell you boats disappeared, why can one be seen in the background? Some areas have weird proportions in the backgrounds, such as the bar's counter looking taller than Chris even though the bartender is the same height as you.<br><br>The characters do seem to have time put into them to make them unique. However one design is not on the store page, which also only has the side perspective.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Performance<\/div>Bayou Island runs well, not putting pressure onto your computer. The only options you do get is volume and you can go into windowed mode by hitting escape. Though I could not find a way to exit out of the game without going to windowed mode and closing out of that.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Replayability<\/div>Of course with point and clickers, the only reason to really replay is for achievements or seeing the different choices you could of made if able to. Bayou Island currently has no achievements and no trading cards so replayability might not be there. You can go back and see all the hints towards the ending twist, but that\u2019s about it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Overall<\/div>+ Appropriate music<br>+ Art<br><br>+\/- Voice acting can be better<br>+\/- Puzzles spike in difficulty at the end<br><br>- Ends abruptly<br><br>Looking more into it, I do see that this is the developer\u2019s first game. Originally going to be a two parter, with the first part having a different system in interacting. I will recommend a few things. The subtitles may work better on the bottom of the screen, and perhaps being able to skip by just clicking than having to press a skip button. Putting in a few animations can help, such as putting a 'waking up' animation instead of having the drunk man sit up and go to sleep immediately. Is Bayou Island so horrible that you shouldn\u2019t buy it? No. With the problems it has, it still has all the aspects of being a good point and clicker. There are things to learn from and I hope this developer continues making games.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_code\"> Bayou Island was provided by <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/Saveorquit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" > SaveorQuit<\/a> to review <\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30439064', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30439064' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30439064\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30439064' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30439064\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30439064', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30439064_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30439064_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30628485\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198374772468\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"414506740\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198374772468\/\" data-miniprofile=\"414506740\">knightclub8364<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198374772468\/games\/?tab=all\">2 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198374772468\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198374772468\/recommended\/597210\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">1.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was awesome!! interesting range of puzzles which kept me engaged. Sure the voicework isn't to everyone's taste but you can turn the volume down to zero for that if you want to. Still it's nice to see (or hear even) an attempt for voice acting in an indie point and click where quite a few others are opting not to have them at all. Game took me about an hour and a half to complete which seemed about right for the price. I enjoyed the interesting different characters in the game and I loved the unique art style for both the characters and the backgrounds. Like a few others have said the ending is somewhat abrupt but offers a satisfying conclusion to the story and ties up all the loose ends.
