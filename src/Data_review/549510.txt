You ought to do that. Price it where there is some discount per tutorial, like 0% to 50% off, depending on how long the tutorial has been on Steam. A few deeply discounted vids would make the bundle worth it, even if some have already bought some of the tutorials. With the new Steam bundling, it no longer penalizes you for having already bought part of the bundle. No double charges.)<br><br>There are three videos total. The first one talks about:<br>* What is speedpainting?<br>* How do you get better at it?<br>* Knowledge (anatomy, mechanical design, the world of information relevant to design, etc.) is critical and there is no shortcut to that.<br>* Tool (brush preset) familiarity is also critical.<br>* Time limit yourself, with an agenda (an actual specific goal for the subject).<br><br>The second one shows this in action with short challenges.<br><br>The third shows a 15 min speed paint that illustrates what can be done in that time frame and one way of iterating through the painting to add refinement in the given timeframe.<br><br>Is it worth it? It's not a silver bullet, since that doesn't exist. It is some discussion by a professional, and some examples of the work flow. Something like this *might* be found on YouTube, but good luck finding it. Everyone and their dog has made a video and called it a &quot;speed paint&quot; because some illiterate chowderhead heard the term &quot;speed paint&quot; somewhere and used that term for his sped-up video instead of the age-old, correct term of &quot;time-lapse.&quot; Consequently, there are probably, no exageration, 4.7 MILLION 'speedpaint' videos to go through to find the &quot;Concept Design Speed paintings,&quot; of which there are precious few. It took me going through 700 MLP, SU, and every sort of anime fan art 'time-lapse' videos mislabled as &quot;Speedpaint&quot; before I found a video from Cubebrush, an actual Concept Design artist.<br><br>In short, real concept design videos are hard to find. It may be worth paying for if you really want to learn the techniques. <br><br>(BTW, I suggest Concept Design artists start calling &quot;speed painting&quot; something else, such as &quot;concepting,&quot; or at least religiously use &quot;Concept Design&quot; and other related keywords on their web sites and videos, since &quot;speedpainting&quot; has been utterly polluted now. I suggest a unique word like concepting so that searches are more accurate, since &quot;Concept Design&quot; is a very broadly used term as well, and certainly isn't restricted to &quot;speed painting&quot; techniques. Rant over.)<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28460934', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28460934' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28460934\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28460934' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28460934\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28460934', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28460934_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28460934_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/549510\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["28460934"]}
