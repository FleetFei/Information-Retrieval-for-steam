I decided to take a couple hours off work to play the game and give it a quick and honest review of my first impressions, and it pulled me in enough to get me to dedicate the time to finish it.  I went into this game with the knowledge and expectations one should have of an indie RPG, and came out with a pleasurable experience.  I can sense the love and care that went into this RPG, and could recommend it to anyone who is interested in an indie JRPG experience.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">DURATION PLAYED<\/div>I finished the game with one character and grinded to max level (30) in about 15 hours.  The average I've seen reported seems to be around the 10 hour mark.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">LIKES<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>First off, I was impressed to see that you can play the story from the perspective of 6 different characters.  So far, from what I can see, these are not major branching storylines, but instead allow you to choose the &quot;main character&quot;.  Depending on the main character you've chosen you will get different dialogue scenes at different points in the game.<br><\/li><li>The character spritework is great.<br><\/li><li>You see enemies on the main map, which is something I very much enjoy.<br><\/li><li>The combat in Celestian Tales is very standard JRPG, like Final Fantasy.  Each character takes a turn and the player chooses from a menu.  Each character has HP and Sta.  The combat mode is very tight and polished, with a dynamic camera that seems inspired by Radiant Historia.  You will heal to full HP after every battle, but your Sta is regained by defending or attacking.<br><\/li><li>The music is very appropriate and pleasant to listen to.<br><\/li><li>The storytelling and writing is well done.  I like the dynamic between the different character personalities, and I can see a lot of character development just within the first few hours of play.<br><\/li><li>The art style is very unique.  I can't think of any other JRPGs I've played with this art style.<br><\/li><li>The characters are each given interesting and unique skills that seem to fit their personalities and backgrounds well while maintaining a unique balance.<br><\/li><li>You choose 3 characters to take into combat, and can easily swap out the party whenever you feel like.<br><\/li><li>The leveling system is unique in that your entire party has a single level rather than each individual character.<br><\/li><li>Your characters can each carry 4 active and 2 passive skills into combat and you can equip them as you like in the menu before combat for different strategies.<br><\/li><li>There is a weapon upgrading system a few hours into the game where you can use materials you've gained from combat to upgrade weapons.<\/li><\/ul><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">DISLIKES<\/div><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>I've come across a few obvious, but minor, bugs and 1 critical, but un-reproducing bug.  I just had to relaunch my last save and the bug never occurred again.  It is surprisingly stable for such a large project with a small team on a tight budget.<br>    <\/li><li>Usually the environment art looks very nice and polished, but there are some points that seem like they could have been touched up more.  These spots are usually the interiors to houses and the towns.<br>    <\/li><li>The quest log is sometimes not descriptive enough on where to go or do next or doesn't update for some of the small milestones in the chapter quest.  This made it a little confusing at times for me.<br><\/li><li>The world map is a bit barebones compared to some traditional RPGs, but is enough to give a feeling for the size and shape of the land.<br><\/li><li>There's a lack of instructions in the game for some of the different features, so it took some experimenting to figure them out (like how to regain Sta), though this could be a positive for many people.<br><\/li><li>Chapters 3-4  were very easy, then there was a sudden jump in difficulty at Chapter 4.  The step up in difficulty was very much welcomed by me, but it may come as a surprise to some and could probably use a little smoother by ranking up the difficulty of fights before this point.<br><\/li><li>A difficulty mode that switches between varying HP and Damage output of enemies could have benefited this game for some simple customization to difficulty level.<br><\/li><li>Cutscenes aren't skippable.  So if you die on a hard boss fight, you'll have to go through it again.<br><\/li><li>No New Game+.  Maintaining character levels and equipment between games would have made it more enticing to play through again and see other character dialogue scenes.<br><\/li><li>No sidequests.  Some simple fetch and kill sidequests would have helped add some texture to the main storyline.<br><\/li><li>The game's pitch might lead one to believe that there is a lot of branching story options.  However the game is pretty much linear with a few small encapsulated options scattered about.  I would approach this game with the idea of it being a linear storyline like the classics and not a modern &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; type of RPG.<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">SUMMARY<\/div>Celestian Tales focuses its energy on delivering an interesting story through smooth and familiar gameplay.  I recommend Celestian Tales to any JRPG fan that is acceptive of indie production qualities and is looking for a game that focuses heavily on its storytelling.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17476178', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17476178' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17476178\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17476178' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17476178\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17476178', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17476178_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17476178_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t124 of 141 people (88%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17477801\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duranteA\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"31474140\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a251dfe31aaaf0f1d23547873384ad74a103537.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a251dfe31aaaf0f1d23547873384ad74a103537.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7a\/7a251dfe31aaaf0f1d23547873384ad74a103537_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duranteA\/\" data-miniprofile=\"31474140\">Durante<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duranteA\/games\/?tab=all\">715 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duranteA\/recommended\/\">21 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/duranteA\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI've completed the game with one character, and played the prologue with another. This review is based on that experience.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros\/Cons<\/div>+ The music is great<br>+ The graphics as well, surprising amount of 8-way sprite variety considering the budget, and they have some neat little touches like weapon drawing\/sheathing animations<br>+ The pacing is very good throughout the game, there's no filler and nothing feels like it wastes your time<br>+ Equipment is more interesting than most JRPGs so far, quite some trade-offs and unique effects<br>+ I really like the skill\/character advancement system, see below<br>+ Battles so far have also been fun, I'll describe the system below<br>+ You have more choices than what you'd expect in a JRPG<br>+ The characters are pretty interesting, and have a decent party dynamic, however...<br>- The writing is somewhat let down by a number of grammatical errors<br>- Bugs: worst one was a wrong trigger which teleported me somewhere, and the game also referred to itself as a &quot;test build&quot; in one instance; <b>edit:<\/b> Both of these major issues were patched within the first 15 hours and are no longer in the game at this point.<br>- Minor stuff: the run speed could be a bit higher, and I'd like to be able to use the d-pad rather than joystick with gamepad controls<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Character advancement system<\/div>First of all, your entire party levels at once, which is very convenient and makes a lot of sense really.<br>You get 4 slots for active skills and 2 for passive skills per character. Since you level up very often, you soon have to pick and choose the skills for each, and there are some interesting synergies. It has something of Guild Wars almost in that aspect.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Battle system<\/div>The game employs the smart mechanic of healing you back up fully after each encounter. In any game which is not about resource management (which most non-dungeon-crawler JRPGs haven't been about in ages) healing up after battle is just meaningless routine, so I really like that choice.<br><br>I also really like how they do stamina management, which is really the main battle mechanic.<br>You start with a set amount of stamina (which can be adjusted by some equipment and passives), and all skills require a number of stamina points. performing a normal attack regenerates 1 stamina, and defending regenerates 2. There are also ways to transfer stamina from one character to another, and attacks which reduce it in the enemy.<br><br>Since stamina is per-battle, like everything else, you are never not thinking about using it. This mostly prevents the &quot;trash mob&quot; button-mashing scenario.<br><br>Battles are also generally quick, which is something that I always appreciate. Difficulty is pretty well-balanced and what I'd call moderate so far (I consider most modern JRPGs too easy).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17477801', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17477801' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17477801\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17477801' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17477801\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17477801', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17477801_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17477801_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t66 of 89 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>5 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17484897\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Timeraider\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"57759461\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0376aecd54f14cc54a868dbd7c84d0b245804fd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0376aecd54f14cc54a868dbd7c84d0b245804fd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d0\/d0376aecd54f14cc54a868dbd7c84d0b245804fd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Timeraider\/\" data-miniprofile=\"57759461\">Timeraider<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Timeraider\/games\/?tab=all\">740 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Timeraider\/recommended\/\">20 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Timeraider\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">17.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo.. i have played prototype, alpha and beta and now that it has come to Steam ive already played a few hours of the release version to.

Together with the other houses, these will be in war with World Enders (big demonic vikings that want to destroy everything). <br>To be able to do this they will have to make choices between things important to them... devotion to their god, their family, their habits, their heritage and more.<br>How far will you go to protect what you love?<br><br>Overall its not a bad turnbased jrpg at all and the overall gameplay feel is very nice.<br><br>As i said before... the game doesnt go for over the top futuristic &quot;we got so many unseen gaming features&quot; and &quot;look at these new mechanics&quot; ... instead they simply build an well-made game that is basically &quot;good&quot; ... not &quot;super amazing hypetrain 2060&quot;, but still a good distance above &quot;avarage&quot;. Yust a good game that can be enjoyed if you like story and this type genre... nothing more, nothing less.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17484897', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17484897' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17484897\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17484897' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17484897\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17484897', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17484897_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17484897_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17476243\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"782260\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57b9b24ca4182bd288f3e595c1d135e6de889070.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57b9b24ca4182bd288f3e595c1d135e6de889070.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/57\/57b9b24ca4182bd288f3e595c1d135e6de889070_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/\" data-miniprofile=\"782260\">supernick<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/games\/?tab=all\">222 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/supernickx\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolutely awesome. If you were into old school RPGs like Lunar, Suikoden, Breath of Fire, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 1-6 (NES\/SNES era) then you will absolutely love this. An instant classic in my opinion. <br><br>In terms of inspiration, I would say Suikoden is the biggest at hand here.. the warrior is even referenced as &quot;Young Master&quot;.<br><br>My views:<br>+: Amazing, hand drawn graphics style. Really works in today's market flood of 3D.<br>+: Fun battle system, engaging and much more on offer than RPG Maker style games.<br>+: Not an RPG maker game.<br>+: Story is engaging and well thought-out. Writing style is fairly relaxed which isn't for everyone.<br>+: Multiple character approach is interesting. Instead of a 40+ hour game with one character, it is broken out into 5-10 hour chunks with each character.<br><br>Fully recommend for anyone looking for that piece of nostalgia - I'd even recommend for people who haven't played this type of isometric sprite RPG before as it effectively bridges the gap between old and new gaming.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17476243', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17476243' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17476243\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17476243' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17476243\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17476243', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17476243_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17476243_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary19677603\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"105713910\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/7b\/7b322c8e4bf3ee9a26f5111e5565fefbf6ddf952_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105713910\">verstehen<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/games\/?tab=all\">328 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/recommended\/\">35 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065979638\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first of a series of games (three? I think?) CT:ON is fairly good. The story is intriguing, the characters are well-written and developed versions of typical fantasy tropes, the combat system is turn-based (which after all the action RPGs coming out lately is a nice change), and unlike most fantasy games, the party is made up of more women than men (4:2). The music is good, if a little repetitive in the field (though I think I liked every event score), and ultimately I enjoyed it. <br><br>There are a few flaws, though. For one, given that to unlock all the achievements (and likely the different story paths) you have to play the game 6 times is a little annoying, especially since it seems the deviation is really only about 5 scenes (prologue, 3 scenes within the game, epilogue). So I imagine it'll get boring fairly fast and it feels like a way to artificially add time to the game, when the game play itself could probably be finished in 5-6 hours (especially if you're like me and you spent your first playthrough running around over-leveling and making sure you do everything). Also, when you get to the epilogue, the English gets a little messy... like missing words and sentence fragments (possibly for stylistic effect that's just gone wrong). Finally, when you finally do get the world map open, it frustrated me a little to see all the areas I couldn't visit in this game. <br><br>Basically, I'll probably run through the game 2-3 more times, with the characters I liked the most, but I don't expect the kind of replay they really must have wanted with the 6 different stories.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19677603', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19677603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19677603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19677603' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19677603\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19677603', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19677603_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19677603_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">13 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17587930\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"85618813\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d08e17f50f1015d7761f4c40e6fe078051d8b6a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d08e17f50f1015d7761f4c40e6fe078051d8b6a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9d\/9d08e17f50f1015d7761f4c40e6fe078051d8b6a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/\" data-miniprofile=\"85618813\">90sVibe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/games\/?tab=all\">1,667 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/recommended\/\">7 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198045884541\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 17, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA pretty cool indie JRPG. I really like the characters and the conflicting personalities, and Yli is super cute and funny :) The battle systems are not bad etc, and the story is quite engaging as well. I'm only a couple of hours in and I've heard the game is quite short - that being said it's a three part story and the second part will be released sometime in the future. There's also alot of reading dialogue, but I enjoy that so all good. <br>The only thing that I was disapointed in was there was alot of potential for story to be taken further in side-quests based on characters you meet telling you about themselves and what is unresolved in their life. EG A young boy has never left<br>his village and wants to so he can find his father, but just when you think &quot;Ok this is an interesting story moment&quot; he<br>basically shrugs his shoulders and says &quot;Maybe I will one day&quot; and thats it? From what I have heard of the games length<br>it can't be revisited and expanded on because the game is too short to do this and alot of other story side-quests that<br>could have been really interesting and added more to the feel and depth of the game. Pity. Hope it's revisited in the later<br>installments.<br>To be honest the game doesn't rival old JRPGs and is not a patch on Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3, Earthbound, Phantasy Star IV etc<br>but if you like classic JRPGs that are new, you could do a lot worse. I also think it's still on sale, but that might have past<br>now.<br><br>I will update this review when I finish it and also later when the other two episodes are released.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17587930', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17587930' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17587930\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17587930' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17587930\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17587930', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17587930_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17587930_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17523339\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065852838\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"105587110\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50dd66568231e8b4b9ed392ea9ebff99f253c023.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50dd66568231e8b4b9ed392ea9ebff99f253c023.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/50\/50dd66568231e8b4b9ed392ea9ebff99f253c023_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065852838\/\" data-miniprofile=\"105587110\">Loser King<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065852838\/games\/?tab=all\">63 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065852838\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198065852838\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 13, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all, a disclaimer for those who (like me) didn't read all the informations on the game's store page. <br><br>This game is THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF A TRILOGY. Unfortunately I think it's not stated well enough on the starting page, as I bought the game without knowing it. Further on why this information is crucial.   <br><br>This game is a traditional RPG with a nice and well orchestrated story line and a good soundtrack. I think that the developers did a nice job with the  game overall and for that I recommend it, however there are many pro and cons in this game that made the overall judgement of the game not easy to reach.  To convey why I felt a little torn about the positive judgement I gave to the game in the end, I'll listen each pro and its relative con one after another.<br><br>Story<br>PRO <br>-Heavy store line, the devs were quite transparent with their Game of Thrones inspiration yet the story has a dignity of its own. On the other hand, there are some recurring tropes, and if you don't like the GoT setting, well, this would make the game quite less enjoyable for you.  Also, during the game you will have a couple occasion when you will have to make important decision regarding the story and the setting...<br>CON<br>...but it won't matter, since the game is a trilogy and as stated from the Devs in the game discussion those decision will only come to play in the two future installment of the series. As you can expect, the game will also have some loose ends and an ending that closes the chapter but leaves the story open for the future installment. Some people might be quite discouraged from it.<br><br>Combat<br>PRO<br>-The Combat System is interesting, and altough it might look simple at a first glance, it is quite rewarding to learn and master, with a few sore notes regarding some whacky scalings and mechanics. <br>You will control a party of 3 and will be free to change composition out of combat.<br>Characters have a resource called Stamina that ranges from 0-8, attacking restores 1 stamina while defending restores 2, skills are used consuming stamina while items are free but also don't restore stamina. Managing stamina between attack, defense and skill is how you win your battle. Stats are also quite relevant, and characters are differentiate enough in their skills, with, for example, a Crossbow wielder that is effective against high armor targets, a character using dagger that is efficient against humanoid targets, and so on. <br>CON<br>What I previously stated about the combat system is true, but for the most part of the game the battle are so easy that you can just spam attack and occasionally heal and still get through the game. Things get a little more heated up during boss fights and the last 2 chapters of the game, where they actually spike insanely, but overall I lost a grand total of 1 time during 2 playthroughs. And the main reason because I lost, was because I didn't expect for enemies to spike that hard between chapters.<br><br>Art<br>PRO<br>The style reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, and the OST is very well done, characters portraits and art is well made and even their sprites are quite &quot;cute&quot; (considering the 16 bit style).<br>I already covered the OST but I have to add that the developer placed care in tieing the key moments of the narration with a fitting track. <br>CON<br>Certain aspects of the game show how the developer had to make tough choices with the little budgets they had. <br>While the character art is really well done, other things like the overworld map, or how town and indoors are made look really quaint and poorly executed. I can't blame them since they game is quite cheap, but I expected something more polished.<br><br>Replayability<br>PRO<br>The 6 characters are all well designed, and they have an unique prologue chapter each. <br>They also have some unique cutscenes where they have to make certain decisions, and paired with how you can play different character compositions it adds to replayability<br>Also, save games will be carried over to the next game.<br>CON<br>As for the story, their unique decision don't affect the game that you buy now, but the later installment. <br>Is something that quite bugs me but that I can come to term with. <br><br>Overall, I confirm my positive review, as Celestian Tales: Old North is indeed a solid game  but with a few caveats: I understand that the game is cheap and that it's just the first chapter, but I really hope that the next game will straighten up some of the problems that the first chapter had. <br>I don't expect them to change the whole game world and upgrade all the arts, but some things like the issues with enemy scalings during chapters could be fixed with a little number tweaking. <br>I also expect that the decisions we took during this chapter will have some implication during the lategame and won't just alter a cutscene, but I'm not sure if they will able to deliver that with the budget they had.<br>And, lastly, it has to evolve the game: If the next 2 chapter will make me feel like they fragmented the game to sell each chapter like it was an adventure game like Deponia, or a Telltale game, I'm not sure if my judgement will stay the same, as then I will have to consider it as a single game that costs as the sum of its parts. <br><br>TL;DR= Positive review, but they have to deliver with the next 2 games as it's a story-driven game that is part of a trilogy\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17523339', 'summary' );

Follow their journey from the point of view of one of the six characters as you are presented with a number of moral decisions that affect things in the world. Decisions you make will carry over into the next 2 installments of this series, according to the devs.<br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>==========<br>Old North features a lot of the familiar RPG mechanics we are used to, most notably the turn-based battle system. Each character takes turns in battle, with you being able to choose each character's action each turn. Attacking, Defending, using items or skills, or even run away. Your characters have a pool of health called HP (Hit or Health Points) which drop as they take damage. Instead of the usual MP (magic points), Old North uses an interesting Stamina gimmick for spells and abilities. Each action you take in battle (attacking, defending, etc) stocks 1 Stamina point, and you can hold up to 8. Skills and abilities cost various amounts of stamina points. <br><br>While you do have 6 characters to choose from, only 3 can be used in battle at a time. However, outside of battle you are able to freely swap them out at any time. Each character is suited for a specific purpose, Lucienne, for example, is best used as a tank as her abilities allow her to hold the attention of enemies and take reduced damage. Aria has access an array of healing abilities, making her best suited as a healer. Other characters do share some abilities that can allow them to play these roles as well, such as Reynard, who is best suited as a melee fighter but also has a taunt skill. This allows him to be a secondary tank when needed. <br><br>Even though characters each have these abilities, the game is easy enough to where you don't really have to utilize them in such a manner. Most battles can be won by simply attacking. Only a few boss battles require a bit more strategy, in which an understanding of each character's abilities really come in handy. Enemies roam about each area in plain sight, and can be avoided if you so choose. If you touch one on the field, a battle ensues, allowing you to gain experience points, loot, and level up. Earned loot can later be used to upgrade your parties' weapons.<br><br>Perhaps the most unique feature is that instead of your characters individually gaining levels...your entire group gains them as one. As the party level increases, each character learns new abilities. This streamlines the experience quite a bit, as it eliminates a lot of grinding that we see in many RPGs, allowing players to focus more on the story. Speaking of story, each character has a different background that is unique and compelling, but I will not spoil anything here!<br><br><b>Graphics<\/b><br>==========<br>Nearly everything in Old North is hand-drawn or hand-painted, and that's quite impressive. Every detail is expertly drawn\/painted, and look amazing. Environments in particular look great, but lack depth. Sometimes it's hard to tell if an archway is a door or simply architectural design. Some shading here or there would have helped solve this problem. <br><br>Perhaps the characters and enemies are the only things not hand-painted or drawn, though one could argue that pixel art is done by hand. Their sprites look really good, and remind me of those found in the Suikoden titles. One detail I noticed is that as your characters or enemies take damage, they show signs of fatigue. This is a small detail I wish more RPGs would use.<br><br>I simply love the art design of this game, I can't praise it enough. Even the animated cutscenes (especially the opening video) look really nice, albeit a bit...primitive. Still looks great regardless. Character portraits are perhaps my favorite aspect of the game, as they reflect how a character is feeling or expressing themselves at any given time and are very detailed. Their expressions change during dialogue and do not remain static for too long.<br><br><b>Sound and Music<\/b><br>==========<br>Old North features a score that really captures the pace of the game and helps convey the emotion of the story as it goes along. Low and somber tracks for the more emotional scenes, while battles and more intense scenes have a more upbeat and dramatic sound to them.<br><br>No annoying footstep sound effects here, which is a plus! Weapon attacks and opening chests sounds are oddly satisfying. Using buffing abilities like Protection or Toxic Touch all have the same effect\/sounds, which becomes glaringly obvious after awhile. Perhaps a bit more work or tweaking of the sound direction of the game could help to improve the experience.<br><br><b>Performance<\/b><br>==========<br>Old North runs very well, though I did notice one thing that other people will undoubtedly see as well. During scene transistions, flashes of the scene that is loading can be seen for a moment. Not a huge deal, but it's definitely noticeable. Aside from that, I did not see any framerate drops, stuttering, lag, or slowdown. The game has full controller support, and plays very well with one. You'll feel like you are playing a console RPG!<br><br><b>Final Thoughts<\/b><br>==========<br>Celestian Tales is a nice JRPG with enough depth and a compelling story that most RPG fans should be able to enjoy it. It's few flaws pale in comparison to everything else the game does right. An excellent addition to RPG fans' libraries, I look forward to the next 2 installments of this series in the future!<br><br><b>Gameplay Demo<\/b><br>==========<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5BaY4-TMMHM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5BaY4-TMMHM<\/a><br><br><b>Nerd House Verdict<\/b>:<br>==========<br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>Recommended<\/b><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17756118', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17756118' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17756118\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17756118' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17756118\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17756118', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17756118_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17756118_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17482772\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"117542792\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cb9dbc1260b0f843b54c0996149dd9625cd8a3d1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cb9dbc1260b0f843b54c0996149dd9625cd8a3d1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/cb\/cb9dbc1260b0f843b54c0996149dd9625cd8a3d1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/\" data-miniprofile=\"117542792\">LMG<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/games\/?tab=all\">634 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077808520\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 10, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis one tips the scales back and forth between being a good or bad game for me at least. <br><br>The art is hand drawn, quite beautiful. Reminiscent of Suikoden which is awesome btw.<br><br>Allowing replayability with 6 different characters. <br><br>First little bit of gameplay if you'd like to check before you buy<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ye22I2FmOuo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ye22I2FmOuo<\/a><br><br>Different gear and tactics do change it up a bit<br><br>Rather good storytelling.<br><br>Now for the cons:<br>First off, does have a few bugs. Like showing a summary of chapter 7 when your in chapter 1. Kind of a spoiler and some nps go a little funky hopefully gets patched out. SPOILERS! And when your at the war camp and go back to Levantine and they are already talking about the victory that hasn't EVEN happend yet. I'm sorry but how do you mess that one up? Did they think you would stay on the rails and never look around lol. <br><br>Battle is rather boring and you'll find you can just spam the attack commands as you will usually get the same results using tactics most of the time. <br><br>Other than your main character you will never feel like your getting any in depth character knowledge of any other characters in the game. You could replace the supporting characters with potatoes and I'd get the same feelings and at least we'd have french fries. <br><br>If you poke around other than the main questline you'll find it all rather empty and linear forcing you back on the main quest. Pretty  scenery but all the npcs say rather generic stuff. <br><br><br>Story tempo is crazy fast paced as beating this one with each character reportedly doesn't take too long. The game is part of a planned trilogy. Budget-wise it probably was easier to make this three parts to fund it but I feel it would have been better off all in one game. <br><br>Does boast your character will be faced with tough decisions. Yes that is true, but nowhere do you actually ever have a choice on what to do. <br><br>Conclusion:<br>The game defintitely qualifies as a work of art. harkens back to a better day of JRPG'S. <br>Suffers from too fast paced storyline and not enough side stuff or a real vibrant world you feel you belong in.<br>The battle is standard JRPG fare and defintely a step up from RPG maker slush filling up steam on a daily basis. <br>The story is pretty good, just makes me wish it was slower and a little more, but wanting more is never a bad thing. Actually looking forward to the sequel. <br>Pretty good price.<br><br>I'd give this a 7\/10. <br><br>Not a masterpiece but not bad either.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17482772', 'summary' );

So you probably know why this is going to be a bit hard to review because I was busy playing and getting into the story and   was about to resolve major conflict when all of a sudden....sad soundttrack rolls in and credits show. SO I am like.....wait, the game done already! Not a ra$$. Listen, this just needs to end, like stop half-assing things, just do it well and give an experience one will never forget. This happen to me before with another game that I found out had 4 other parts to it-__-. Who you think ago buy the rest! Get the hell out of here with that.<br><br>As for what I applaud the game for:<br>- Interesting characters, I laud the depth that must have been placed in each. I played with the blond intellectual female. I was thoroughly impressed by her discerning attitidude and morals.<br>- Interesting storyline, kept me wanting to learn more. There are deep moral and ethical principals at play here and it allowed for introspection of certain real life issues<br>-Combat was great. I ennjoyed it thoroughly, fast-spaced turn vs turn aspect,<br>-Appreciated the graphics, clean and well done.<br><br>So should this be recommended, yes it will be but I will not laud it without pointed out my major fault seh it too damn short and it doesnt allow the player to experience the full capability of the project as it wasnt completed.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29389424', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29389424' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29389424\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29389424' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29389424\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29389424', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29389424_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29389424_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29025420\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greenspottedeer\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"346384162\">Hobby_goat17<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 15.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt very interesting game which I kind want to try all the options before I put in towel.

I paid the game about 5 bucks, and clearly I got my money worth. Is it the best JRPG out there? No! But it is entertaining.<br><br>Story:<br>This is the first part of a 3 part story. The story is not bad but not great, fairly classic really. I was enjoying it up to the end but the last act made little sense to me. There are 6 characteres with a different twist on the story, I may replay the game in easy with the other characters just to get the rest of the story.<br>Though I really liked how the story unfolds. In particular, I enjoyed that because you could play any of the 6 characters, the story unfolds with a form of group dynamic rather than a &quot;leader+whoever has a useful\/funny line&quot; way. Though it tends to make dialogue phases quite long because each character adds his\/her grain of salt.<br>I liked that the story tries to take a modern look on questions of race, religion, and class to make the player think backabout it. It is never too forced on the player, but the game manages to say what it has to say. Some might say it has a SJW feel, but Ithink it is fairly reasonnably approached, so I was fine with it.<br><br>Graphics:<br>The game is well drawn. I really enjoyed the high quality 2d graphics. It is a bit pixelly and I feel vector graphics would have been better, but the graphics are still really enjoyable.<br><br>Music:<br>Most are forgettable, but some good pieces.<br><br>Gameplay:<br>I think the gameplay is a better point of the game. In particular I liked that your HP\/MP (here stamina) reset at each fight, so you never have to heal between fight or micro manage MP. It tends to make you play each fight like the last fight. There are enough effects, combos to keep you entertained. I liked that no weapon is useless, as  they can all be upgraded and lead to different build of your team.<br>It would have been good to give the player a bit more details about the game mechanics, how important is it to get +1 in an attribute, or how are damage of bleeding calculated, that kind of things.<br><br>Length:<br>depends on whether you care about the story or not. But reading most of the text, it took me about 7 hours to get to the final boss, and about 3 hours to beat it. So I would say, you will beat the game between 5 and 10 hours. You can replay the gameto see more dialogue, but that is more a gimmick to extend the life of the game than anything else.<br><br>Final comment:<br>I payed 5 bucks for the game, and it kept me entertained and thinking about it for a couple of days. It is not a bad investment. I bought the prequel DLC, and will probably buy the second and third part once they are released.<br>The difficulty curve is a bit strange, but I liked that you can change the difficulty setting during the game. I upped the difficulty mid game becasue the lowest difficulty was really too simple. I may rerun the game in higher difficulty.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28700303', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28700303' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28700303\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28700303' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28700303\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28700303', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28700303_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28700303_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28630734\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/luccia_soryucca\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"75039931\">Soryucca<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 25.1 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 25, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWould recommend this game if you love something related to Game of Thrones and Suikoden.<br>I don't know why I feel this game reminds me of both titles, perhaps because of the political and adult fantasy storyline.<br>Therefore, the battle system is very familiar with classical JRPG, although the difficulty progress seems a bit unbalanced.<br>The artwork is beautiful, I love the concept art.<br>The music brings emotional value to the player. <br><br>My score 7\/10 .

I did not have any pre-existing expectations on this game, I just thought it seemed pretty interesting and dove right in, and the game proved to be quite interesting, I was amused by how some of the others of noble birth reacted to the menial tasks that the common people usually deal with.  Besides Yli, the other characters that I really liked were Camille and Isaac, they seemed the most level headed of the group, Lucienne wasn't bad either but Reynard was pretty annoying, muscle headed idiot... Aria though, definitely the most annoying, hate those super devout preaching types, she's only good for the heals but not really necessary as Yli can also help her allies to heal and the more useful characters like Lucienne can also heal themselves.  <br><br>The story didn't feel as fulfilling as I hoped, but it's only the first installment in a trilogy, I'm hoping that I can visit the other places on the map later on and see the consequences of any of my actions, like possibly miffing off that one little noble twerp...  All in all though a pretty decent game, and one I'd recommend to anyone who is not super fussy about rpgs and the like.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27651769', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27651769' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short27651769\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27651769' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short27651769\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27651769', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27651769_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short27651769_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short26351326\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198082188350\/recommended\/315860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"121922622\">danisking<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 9.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 1, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnot much to it but what was there was good.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26351326', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26351326' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short26351326\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26351326' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short26351326\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26351326', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26351326_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short26351326_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/315860\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 261 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["17476178","17477801","17484897","17476243","19677603","17587930","17523339","17756118","17482772","17484918"]}
