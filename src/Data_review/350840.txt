I initially found a lot of the controls and accessing and using menu options oddly configured, but nothing all that hard to adjust to and I don\u2019t even remember what most of the issues were.  Inventory and graphics options work fine but it did take me a couple of minutes to figure it out.<br><br>I agree that the A &amp; D movement keys do not work as advertised \u2013 a double tap will give you a roll to the left and right but I couldn\u2019t see any discernable movement just holding them down.  But I also never found any place where it mattered to the gameplay.  Circle strafing not required in combat!<br><br>At the default graphics settings the game played horribly on my rig.  After I adjusted the settings the game still looked really good and played fine EXCEPT 1) in Runetown, near the water, when there are a lot of NPCs around, during a thunderstorm and 2) a timed run through some caverns with combat and ledges to fall off and a companion to keep alive who was suicidal and not much good in a fight.  Better framerates would be an improvement obviously but the game runs fine as is.<br><br>This is a huge world with very nice graphics and a lot of places to discover and many, many quests to complete.  Unlike a lot of other games, including ones that are reviewed very favorably, there are very few invisible walls that restrict your movement.  The boundaries are almost always real world objects like mountains or walls.  If it looks like you should be able to reach something, you can.  It might be pointless at times but I like to explore thoroughly rather than just following roads or waiting for the next quest icon to appear at the top of the screen.  Sometimes you find stuff.  Sometimes you struggle to get to the top of an almost impossible to reach mountain peak and your only reward is some clipping because the game creators got a little careless since most people would have taken the hint and given up.<br><br>The only thing I do not like about the game is the puzzles.  Either they suck or I suck at puzzles.  Either way, too much of my playing time was spent solving them.  Many I solved through trial and error and once I figured them out, I would look back at the clue and still have no idea how it should have helped me solve it.<br><br>But some time in the next few days I will paste my notes into a game guide.  It won\u2019t be anything pretty but at least you\u2019ll have some solutions if you don\u2019t have the intelligence (spelled p a t i e n c e) to solve them on your own.<br><br>There were also a few glitches or poor design decisions.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, I did everything I could find in Bonetown and there were all these inaccessible doors and I thought it was a really short and crappy game.  But retraced my steps looking for something I might have missed and eventually went back inside the house where the game starts and when I exited there was a quest activated.  No idea if this was a glitch or planned that way but either way, guessing some people would have just quit which is unfortunate.<br><br>And in the Ghetel and on Rune Island, I had to save the game and reload it in order to activate events that you needed to complete the quest\/location.<br><br>I\u2019ll spell things out more in the guide.<br><br>Also worth noting that at about 70% completion, credits rolled which normally indicates the end of the game.  But you can keep playing.  Currently I am stuck at 78% completion because I can\u2019t figure out the latest in the series of never-ending puzzles.  But I\u2019ll add it to the guide when I do figure it out!<br><br>To sum up.  A flawed game with some questionable design decisions but which is still a lot of fun to play.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20943621', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20943621' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20943621\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20943621' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20943621\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20943621', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20943621_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20943621_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/350840\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 9 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["20943621"]}
