There are some issues which I would describe as a minor nuisance but overall game is not as bad as some reviews may suggest. Please note that you have to buy episode 2 separately so you don't get burned like me .<br><br><b> Technical Problems <\/b><br><br>I was experiencing some stuttering but unlocking framerate in video settings fixed it. Honestly, my biggest problem with the game is the camera that constantly changes position. There are no settings to just lock it in place which would make the game a lot better for me. Other than that I just run into few glitches that did not impact the game in any big way .<br><br><b> Story and Dialogue <\/b><br><br>The story seems to be the focal point of bad reviews so I want to give my feedback on it. It is a very cheesy game with somewhat cringy dialogue but a lot of my favorite platformers were the same way. I guess the character is all about girlpower but she sounds forcefully stereotypical (which is fine for a game like BladeKitten). Voice acting is good so you just have to accept the game for what it is. I did not care for the plot that much but I do like the way episode 1 ended. <br><br><b> Controls  <\/b><br><br>I can only speak for myself but I had no problems with controls whatsoever. There are some mechanics with combat that may take time getting use so don't skip tips. To shield brake enemy just hold B (on controler) or equivalent on keyboard next to enemy but not too close. Platforming is actually very easy because the game assists you with grabbing objects. You can climb all over the place even around the corners which done by just touching walls. Out of all the wall climbing games I played BladeKitten by far has the easiest way to do it. I played on a controller and had no problems.<br><br>Note* To do a critical move look at her face in the bottom-left corner. When it is red during combat you have to to attack enemy while running.<br><br><b> Platforming and Combat <\/b><br><br>I thought the platforming elements were done very well . Unlike most games BladeKitten takes full advantage of the mechanics like wall climbing and combat in the mid-air. Your sword flies around so even if you jumping or upside down you can still fight enemies. There is a nice mix of moves including slide attack, air-stump,grab, critical move and basic close\/long range attacks. There are a lot of complex platforming sections where you may need to climb upside down on moving platforms which gives the game nice dynamics.<br><br><b> Unlockable items and Collection <\/b><br><br>Ther are a lot of road forks and many of them lead to hidden items or currency. This game does a good job rewarding the player for curiosity. You can enter a store where you can unlock skins, upgrades, and weapons. There is a nice selection of skins which this game should be praised for. Unfortunately, it does seem like those skins have any special powers. I kind of expect each skin to have a unique perk or ability which is a missed opportunity.<br><br><b> Aesthetic Value <\/b><br><br>In my humble opinion, the game is rather pretty and soundtrack is fantastic. Backgrounds and detail in some of the levels is gorgeous (maybe except the first level). In general, the animation is high quality. Not too much variety when it comes to stages though. Overall I really like the way main character moves and she even has animations that have no purpose like moving the head when sticking to a wall (always a nice touch)<br><br><b> Other design Problems <\/b><br><br>Navigation can be a bit confusing. The first quarter of the game has literally 1 enemy type (it does get better after that) Boss battles are either too easy or can be abused . In general the game offers next to no challenge because there are checkpoints like every 30 seconds.<br><br><b> Verdict 7\/10 <\/b><br><br>BladeKitten is somewhat mistreated with bad reviews that come from people who obviously did not beat level 1. I mean people focus on few things that game does badly and nobody mentions what it does well. There is nothing seriously wrong with the game but it feels unpolished .It looks very nice and there are a lot of good platforming sections. Dialogue can be eye-rolling but I don't judge platformers on a story.  For $3 at full price I don't think there is any reason not to try it . I liked the game enough to put Episode 2 on my wishlist and I will buy it on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30691014', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30691014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30691014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30691014' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30691014\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30691014', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30691014_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30691014_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30862174\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/benatt\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"48733494\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d5c31f984a301aad633e9c119bc7255ebcef47f0.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d5c31f984a301aad633e9c119bc7255ebcef47f0.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d5\/d5c31f984a301aad633e9c119bc7255ebcef47f0_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/benatt\/\" data-miniprofile=\"48733494\">Rewards.GG - Kaiirin<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/benatt\/games\/?tab=all\">467 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/benatt\/recommended\/\">37 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/benatt\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Combat, platform &amp; kitten<\/div>I wasn't a fan of Blade Kitten when I started playing the game and the beginning of the game was kinda hard because it definitely made to play with a pad, and I hate playing with a pad.

Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.<br><br>The levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.<br><br>The combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.<br><br>The character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.<br><br>Due to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.<br><br>Although each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels. (For comparison, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; storytelling is perfect!)<br><br>Overall, this game is okay. Between &quot;Yes!&quot; and &quot;No!&quot; I give this game a &quot;Meh&quot;.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12416299', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '12416299' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary12416299\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '12416299' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary12416299\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '12416299', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12416299_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary12416299_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17575508\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBlade Kitten is a charming game when you first start it up. The main character, Kit Ballard, is a spunky cat-girl who happens to be a bounty hunter with a new rival in town. The look of the game is cheery and bright, and the promise of a fun rivalry-based adventure sets the scene nicely. Although they say first impressions are generally the most important, this rule doesn't really apply to Blade Kitten. The game starts strong, but fizzles quickly due to some awkward mechanics, technical issues, and a paper-thin story.<br><br>Kit Ballard, as a main character, is interesting enough, and certainly fills the cat-girl &quot;moe&quot; archetype satisfactorily. However, the story, which starts off strong, falls into the &quot;chase&quot; trope fairly quickly, and becomes no more than snippy remarks and chase scenes during cutscenes. Although the lead and her rival certainly have their personalities, they just aren't enough to keep you engaged in the story.<br><br>However, since this is a relatively cheap game, a lax story might be forgivable. What isn't, however, is bad gameplay mechanics. The game's world is futuristic, and characters seem to hover around on a lessened gravity planet, which sounds cool in theory, but in practice proves to be quite frustrating. The game's levels feature platform-based gameplay, which means precision-based running and jumping is a must. However, the low-gravity properties of the game mean that there is a lot of skidding around, and you can't stop on a dime or take off at full speed. Though this isn't much of an issue in the beginning, you'll find the sliding mechanic increasingly annoying as the game progresses and you encounter &quot;trap&quot; levels that require precision button pressing and obstacle avoidance.<br><br>Another aspect of the game's mechanics that gets agitating quickly is the swordplay. Blade Kitten\u2019s weapon of choice is a big, floating sword that can attack enemies near and far with quick or ranged attacks. However, the problem with the sword is that it only works half of the time. For instance, sometimes I would target an enemy from a distance, and when my ranged attack was unleashed, the enemy would still be standing there. Even the quick attack was flawed, and hammering on the swift attack button when encountering several enemies at once never yielded the results that I hoped. The floating sword mechanic could have really been cool, but with the lack of precise targeting, the sliding controls, and the lack of consistency in battle make this weapon more of a chore to deal with rather than an exciting gameplay component.<br><br>The game's mechanics really handicap this title and cause it to fall short of its potential. And the real tragedy of this is that the level design is actually quite good. Though the game takes a traditional approach to the side-scrolling aspect, there are multiple paths you can take through each level, and there are tons of bonus areas with treasure chests to explore. However, these areas are normally hidden behind puzzles and switches, which can be difficult to hit because of the wonky controls. On more than one occasion, I passed by treasure-filled bonus areas because I simply wanted to finish the level instead of trying to suffer sliding around trying to hit switches in a precise manner.<br><br>Blade Kitten's level design is also a missed opportunity in the visual area. Though there are plenty of hidden areas and things to explore, none of it looks particularly interesting. Levels generally find a comfortable color scheme, insert a few new elements, and stretch these few elements into an overarching world. This type of visual scheme is not only boring to look at, but can also be disorienting, as backtracking to similar areas can get you seriously lost if you are trying to find a certain area that looks like another part of the stage.<br><br>The only aspect of Blade Kitten that is consistently good is the animated cutscenes. Although most of these are brief with forgettable dialogue, the cutscenes are animated in a very high-quality cel-shaded style. All the animations are fluid, and the game really hits all the right notes for the anime style they wanted. The main characters feature some fun facial expressions and lightning-fast movement. However, even the cutscenes are hampered by poor voicework, which often comes across as wooden and completely unemotional.<br><br>As far as replay value is concerned, Blade Kitten definitely doesn't have much going for it. Although the game has several unlockable items, including new weapons, costumes, and battle-enhancing consumables, the game's currency is dispersed a little too liberally, and it is very possible to unlock all of this content before you've even reached the halfway point. This might be a good thing if you are just trying to run through the game, but if you are looking for a game you can play and then explore, Blade Kitten doesn't have much for you.<br><br>Blade Kitten certainly could have been a good game. It started out promising, and I was excited to experience an old-school platforming title with fun characters that played off the anime\/manga tropes we've all seen over the years. However, what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels.

I read about the game on Reddit so I knew both of these facts full well when buying the game.  I really enjoyed this game. Has great humor. Has impressive levels! I was playing and I would be going a direct I thought was wrong on purpose to explore but it kept getting bigger and bigger so I Thought I was going the right way by mistake so I back tracked and went the other way which also kept expanding. I was super impressed there seemed to be many ways to get to the same place which left lots to be explored. Oh and the levels transitioned very well it was fluid and non stop.  Kit (the hero) is very agile she jumps and climbs well with the controls. Combat is mostly simple.

After 5 years Blade kitten has gotten it's episode 2 and conclusion. Was it worth the finish though? One way to find out, isn't there?<br><br>Blade kitten is a Platformer developed by Krome studios and released by Atari in 2010. If you're familiar with either, you'd know that Krome Studio's made a previous platformer game on the Gamecube and other consoles called &quot;TY: The Tasmanian Tiger.&quot; which is a game that personally I've had a lot of good experiences with when I was younger. Sure, the voice acting was cheesy and some game mechanics were irritating as sin. But it was a fun game. And if you know about Atari, you know they went bankrupt some time ago, but I'll get to that later.<br><br>In Blade Kitten, you play as Kit Ballard. Essentially a catgirl with an interesting hair genetic, but realistically she is part of a rare(?) alien race called the Felion's. It looks like &quot;Felines&quot; but is pronounced differently, get it? Anyways, her job is to be a breaker; which is the game's essential equivalent of a Bounty hunter. Hunts targets, get paid. Usual stuff. First person she runs into is her soon to be rival but not main antagonist; Justice. Blonde woman working for an evil-ish military group known as the Sollers.<br><br>Gameplay is simple stuff. The game runs entirely on a 2.5D plane. 3D models but the game always sticks to it's camera angle; and the game's entire system runs as a platformer. Kit's attacks focus on a hovering &quot;Breaker Blade&quot; which can be swung at melee range, or sent out at a distance. You can hold RMB to spear people's armor or shields, or just to yank them in. There's also special attacks, like a Q to mount and throw soldiers by the head.<br><br>There are a few kinks to work out though, that's unusure if they'll ever get fixed up. First off, Episode 1 was originally designed for consoles. It shows when the &quot;how to play&quot; is just a bunch of symbols with no real display on what you're \/supposed\/ to press. The only one that does show this is the loading screens, and if you have even remotely decent of a computer it wont be around long enough to read. The Enemy AI can also be seen as unfair at times, countering hits from you are most of the basic enemies 90% of the time.<br><br>With Atari closing down in a later year and stopping development of Blade kitten Ep2, there was a pretty long hiatus. But now we have it. Episode 2 has nicer animations, a more consistent 60 FPS and a rather shiny level design! Plus, all the original characters voice actors and new content to boot. It's fun stuff, and was a nice wrap-up for the series.<br><br>Pro's<br>------------<br>+Decent Level design<br>+Lovely world-building<br>+Slipped in references of older games<br>+Level keeps up with you, allowing the player to go pretty damn fast at times.<br>+Slippery, almost wild yet usable controls.<br><br>Con's<br>------------<br>-Some enemies are downright irritating<br>-Climb command registration can be sometimes odd<br>-Some map bugs<br>-Enemy's can be expoited using Wild controls, making bosses rather easy.<br><br>Verdict: Buy it if it interests you. There \/is\/ a demo, so try that first.<br><br>Thanks for the efforts Krome Studios, I'm glad you didn't leave the game for dead.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14954735', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14954735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14954735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14954735' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14954735\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14954735', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14954735_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14954735_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10352903\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"66919080\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fddb4c872029ecdecd677f7f93beb329c4487906.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fddb4c872029ecdecd677f7f93beb329c4487906.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fddb4c872029ecdecd677f7f93beb329c4487906_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/\" data-miniprofile=\"66919080\">BridgetFisher<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/games\/?tab=all\">5,678 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/recommended\/\">250 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BridgetFisher\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">29.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 4, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game went from zero to HERO!  Blade kitten on PC used to be pretty bad when it first came to PC, with some kind of stuttery frame rate limiter which made me feel nauseous playing it.  The dev though NEVER GAVE UP!  Just like Blade kitten the dev not only stayed active on the forums, but kept updating the game for PC to resolve these issues.  The voice acting in the game is really awesome with lots of costumes to unlock and powerups to buy.  A simple platformer game, probably one of the few ever made where the controls WORK!  Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.  From having a little pet to the animations in the game, all of them are awesome!  Replay value is high since the controls are simple, even if you forget them like I did there isnt any move that complex like other games, this game you can pick it up play it, quit anytime, then go back and BOOM right back at the checkpoint.<br><br>Rating:  10\/10  Value:  $14.99\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10352903', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10352903' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10352903\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10352903' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10352903\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10352903', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10352903_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10352903_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20739195\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JacquesLeSauve\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"132954656\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/715e85deb6aacf34de885fdc1091e2a33b3c5f77.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/715e85deb6aacf34de885fdc1091e2a33b3c5f77.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/71\/715e85deb6aacf34de885fdc1091e2a33b3c5f77_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JacquesLeSauve\/\" data-miniprofile=\"132954656\">JacquesLeSauve<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JacquesLeSauve\/games\/?tab=all\">1,135 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JacquesLeSauve\/recommended\/\">94 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/JacquesLeSauve\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">28.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI think girls dressed up as cats are hot... There. I said it.<br>(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)<br><br>Blade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.<br><br>I presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.<br><br>But despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.<br><br>The actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.<br><br>When you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.<br><br>So, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten. Though I'm guessing it probably isn't, is it?\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20739195', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20739195' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20739195\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20739195' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20739195\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20739195', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20739195_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20739195_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17768314\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"133955544\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/75\/75092f0dc5f84b05b3555c62285ce50df43b01ba.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/75\/75092f0dc5f84b05b3555c62285ce50df43b01ba.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/75\/75092f0dc5f84b05b3555c62285ce50df43b01ba_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/\" data-miniprofile=\"133955544\">drake31<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/games\/?tab=all\">1,097 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/recommended\/\">46 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198094221272\/recommended\/9940\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 29, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWell, well, well. Am I Surprised? Hell Yes!<br><br>I choose to play <i>Blade Kitten<\/i> based on name of the title. Yes, that was the reason I installed it and dive right into the game - name <i>Blade Kitten<\/i> and you will get what it say kitten with badass blade (set of blades).<br><br>And my thoughts on this game?<br>This pink hair kitten won my heart, I am pleasantly surprised, I didn't expect amount of fun I will have in six hours of gameplay (only ep.1).<br><br>So what is here to like?<br>Main character for sure. Kit Ballard is funny, smart, cute and badass kitten with really sad past; and when I play fun-to-play character with actual character, game is always better for me.<br>Hollow Wish is world we play in and is lovely to look at, but dangerous to explore because of various enemies that makes your life harder. Some of them are really easy to get rid off, but you will find some tough and annoying mothereffers here as well.<br><br>Eliminating single targets, or smashing thru hordes of enemies is fun and enjoyable; but sometimes it is really far from it, because when you find yourself in siege of enemies from left and right and they are upon you, closer then you wish, and it is really difficult to get out of their deadly grasp. And besides few glitches events, this is probably my only complain for this game.<br><br>As story goes. Yeah, there could be improvements, story could have been more rich, deeper, and all other things you could describe great story. But storytelling was good, story was easy to follow and good enough for me to care what is going to happen next, where is this leading me, and i really want to know how all things from part one transcend to second part, so i most definitely pick up episode two when i can.<br><br>I had a lot of fun and this matters most for me.<br><br><i>Grade:<\/i><b> A-<\/b>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17768314', 'summary' );

It\u2019s a game that\u2019s easy to pick up, with short or long play sessions. I saw some people call it a good \u201cgirlfriend game\u201d and as a female, I guess this isn\u2019t too far off. The game isn\u2019t very difficult so someone who is either new to video games or not the best with platformers, like myself, will probably enjoy themselves. However, on the downside, the game play is also a bit shallow and might disappoint more avid fans of the genre.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story<\/div>The story follows a bounty hunter named Kit Ballard, a pink-haired catgirl with a lot of sass and witty lines to share. Her bounty identification has been stolen and she\u2019s on a mission to catch her rival who has it while getting into misadventures along the way. I didn\u2019t find this part of the game too memorable. It is nice that there are Blade Kitten comics to expand upon the universe and main characters. In game you\u2019re given cutscenes that tell what\u2019s happening but most of the time you\u2019re jumping around in-world.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>I personally enjoyed the gameplay mechanics here. They\u2019re not perfect and many games do it better, but it\u2019s simple and easy to pick up and play. You can use your keyboard and mouse or a controller, which I used and recommend. You control Kit and have her jump around and defeat enemies with hack and slash type action via her giant floating sword. While the level designs aren\u2019t bad, they can be repetitive. The enemies are usually all the same and your attack moves don\u2019t upgrade or change, neither do theirs. With a bit of button mashing you can kill most easily. What the game excels in is being able to explore the levels, there are collectable items like treasure chests and CDs hidden throughout the levels and you have to jump around, climb walls and break floors to find a lot of them. Other than finding more in game money, most of these are useless though.<br><br>You use said in game money to upgrade Kit, like her health bar and such. You can also upgrade her sword to have better stats and spend said money for costumes, which do nothing. I do like the costumes and enjoyed them, however, some of them actually make Kit look like other characters in the game. But her gameplay, voice and everything else doesn\u2019t change so it\u2019s purely cosmetic.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics\/Audio<\/div>The graphics are colorful and bright, and the main character\u2019s pink hair really pops. While things usually look smooth and polished it\u2019s not much to write home about, it looks about what you\u2019d get on a PlayStation 2. On the bright side, this also means most computers can handle running this game. The game has full voice acting, which isn\u2019t half bad. Kit sounds very much like a valley girl, which was a little annoying at times but overall not a huge issue. The generic villains you fight all sound the same, however. The music is ok but I personally wouldn\u2019t pay an extra ten dollars to have the soundtrack, I found it worked in the game but also very forgettable. <br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Easy to pick up and play for any length of time.<br>+ Easy for people not familiar with video games to understand and enjoy.<br>+ Good graphics and audio.<br>+ Very cheap.<br>+ Steam achievements and trading cards.<br>+ Decent replay value if you want to collect all of the achievements.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- While I liked the graphics, they may seem a little dated.<br>- Story is bland and unimportant.<br>- Enemies and levels can get repetitive. <br>- More hardcore platformer fans may find this title too simple.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Thoughts<\/div>This game is a simple platformer, not many bells and whistles. While I enjoyed it aesthetically and got a kick out of being a catgirl who can climb walls and ceilings it also isn\u2019t breaking any molds. The price is great and for only three dollars you will have fun. Despite being released in 2010, I wrote this review because I still like the game and still play it to kill time. I think it\u2019s a good addition to any gamer\u2019s library<br><br><br><b>Rating:<\/b> 7\/10<br><br>This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/elitegives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Elite Giveaways<\/a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29409006', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29409006' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29409006\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29409006' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29409006\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29409006', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29409006_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29409006_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/9940\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 755 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30691014","30862174","10195849","12416299","17575508","9139857","14954735","10352903","20739195","17768314"]}
