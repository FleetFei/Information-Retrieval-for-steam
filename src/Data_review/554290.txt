This is my first time playing the remake in either language.<br><br>Himawari is a Sci-Fi VN from the mind of Goo. Originally a doujin game, it went on to achieve cult hit status and pave its way for a remake, the translation of which is offered here.<br><br>Let's get the negatives out of the way first:<br><br>The port. The remake was originally a PS Vita game, but was ported for the PC in Japanese in early 2016. Unfortunately, it plays like a port. The UI is lacking, making mouse-only\/tablet play difficult. Essential functions are hidden behind keybinds--keybinds which are never outlined anywhere, as far as I can tell. It's the same as the JP version, but at least the JP version included a manual while this version does not. If you, like me, enjoy reading VNs on your television with a controller, you will need to prepare a new keybind setup for the unusual choices made here. Otherwise, keep a keyboard handy.<br><br>Another issue, which is easily fixed, is the background music looping incorrectly. There is already a fan-patch out to fix this, and you can find it in the discussion section on Steam.<br><br>Do not let the fact that this is an all-ages release for a formerly 18+ game discourage you from playing. I'm sure that as an eroge fan, you've heard this all the time, but it's especially true here: you're not missing out on anything. Really. The author, the translators, the fans, everyone who has read Himawari agrees that <i>the remake is the definitive version<\/i>. <br><br>Ok, time for the positives. I have to keep my review brief, but know that the positives <i>far<\/i> outweigh the negatives. You are reading a visual novel. By far the most important parts are ahead:<br><br>Himawari is among the best visual novels I have read, and I have read many. If you can look beyond the overdone amnesiac trope, you will quickly find that this story has much to offer in its episodes (all of which are included in this release). It is equal parts intriguing and emotional. Goo is a god, and I hope that ISLAND will handled by the same translation team.<br><br>The translation here is fantastic. There are a few (very few) typos, which are to be expected with a script of this size, but the prose flows in ways other localizations could only dream of. Conversations read fluidly and are a <i>joy<\/i> to experience. The Himawari translators are currently working on an exciting new project coming to Steam, and I have full faith that they will make it, too, shine in English.<br><br>You should be able to judge the art from the store page photos. It's gorgeous and overflowing with cuteness. When comparing the remake to the doujin version, this is the most noticeable change. While the old version has nostalgic charm for me, the remake is undeniably more polished.<br><br>The music, once patched to loop properly, is rather memorable. I'm not much of a music critic, so I'm not sure what else to say about it. Do apply the loop patch, though.<br><br>You will fall in love with every character in this game, especially Aqua, and the wonderful world Goo has created. You would be doing yourself a disservice to skip this title, despite its technical limitations.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28305794', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28305794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28305794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28305794' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28305794\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28305794', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28305794_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28305794_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28305445\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wavedash\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"42605176\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f5c624b7e6c4aeec6b4729912131f32e711ce474.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f5c624b7e6c4aeec6b4729912131f32e711ce474.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f5c624b7e6c4aeec6b4729912131f32e711ce474_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wavedash\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42605176\">\uff57\uff41\uff56\uff45\uff44\uff41\uff53\uff48<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wavedash\/games\/?tab=all\">238 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wavedash\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wavedash\/recommended\/554290\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received Himawari - The Sunflower - for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHimawari was originally a doujin (indie) visual novel by developer blank-note, released in 2007 as their debut title. It was remade in 2015 by developer Front Wing (The Fruit of Grisaia, Corona Blossom) as a PSP port. I played through this game several months ago, prior to its official release.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Story<\/div>Himawari is a collection of stories centered around one event: the crash of SA-DAN080, a spaceplane designed to shuttle hundreds of civilians to outer space per trip, particularly to the space station Sunflower. Some of the stories are about the people surrounding the incident. Some of the stories are about the incident itself. And some of the stories are about the aftermath.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Characters<\/div>Every character in Himawari struggles with both their past and their future, and I would say that is one of the core themes. Some try to break free of their pasts, some try to regain what they have lost. Some struggle not knowing what their future holds, some don't have any future at all.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Storytelling<\/div>One of Himawari's main strengths is the amount of variety in its narrative styles. There's humor, drama, romance, sci-fi, and mystery. Not only is each &quot;genre&quot; executed well, but they are also separated apart when the situation calls for it. For example, while there are elements of mystery sprinkled throughout the entire story, there is also a side story that is written entirely in a way reminiscent of detective mystery novels.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Art<\/div>When Front Wing released their PSP remake, they also improved the art assets. If you like cute anime girls, well, this game has them in spades. The art is fantastic, and Steam has several nice CGs on display. However, I think the sprites (some of which can be seen in the opening movie) are even better. There's an impressive amount of variety, from innocent to sassy, from vulnerable to condescending.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Sound<\/div>Perhaps Front Wing's greatest addition to the original is the all-star voice actor cast they hired to voice the game, as blank-note's original release was unvoiced. Also worth noting is that all characters are voiced, including side characters and the protagonist.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\t<li>Aqua is voiced by Tamura Yukari (Takamachi Nanoha from Nanoha, Amane Suzuha from Steins;Gate)<br>\t<\/li><li>Aries is voiced by Nonaka Ai (Sakura Kyouko from Madoka Magica, Ibuki Fuuko from Clannad)<br>\t<\/li><li>Asuka is voiced by Kawasumi Ayako (Saber from Fate\/Stay Night, Kasumi Fuu from Samurai Champloo)<\/li><\/ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Just Play the Game<\/div>Himawari is a phenomenal game showcasing everything that I love about visual novels. It uses an interesting setting to explore a diverse cast of characters. Art, music, and voice acting to set different moods for different scenes. And the game evokes a huge spectrum of emotions, ranging from laughter and elation to anguish and shock.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28305445', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28305445' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28305445\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28305445' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28305445\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28305445', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28305445_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28305445_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/recommended\/554290\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28396692\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"83474313\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3058ed96f14afa1341f39b9e86980c74713502f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3058ed96f14afa1341f39b9e86980c74713502f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/3058ed96f14afa1341f39b9e86980c74713502f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83474313\">Gumak<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/games\/?tab=all\">822 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/gumaczysko\/recommended\/554290\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">50.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 15, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHimawari is likely the best, most touching visual novel on Steam, and perhaps the best I'll ever have chance to read.<br><br>Make no mistake, this is no mindless, feel-good title filled with cute girls. Quite the opposite, as soon as the first chapter ends and the real story begins, wave of despair and suffering will hit you with a force of speeding truck and it will not stop any time soon, even if you think it will. But that's the point.<br><br>The best way to describe Himawari is a mixture or character drama, romance, sci-fi and coming of age story. All of those are present but none of them takes the lead. It's a well-executed combination of many different elements coming together as more that just a sum of its parts. And most importantly, it's a motivational piece unlike any other you'll find it this medium.<br><br>Social anxiety, depression, jealousy, obsession, fear of growing up, giving up, coping with loss, uncertanity of future - Himawari speaks of very intimate, personal themes. Your mileage may vary, I must admit, but if any of these resonate with you, Himawari will hit right where it hurts. It made me laugh, gasp in exhilaration, curse out loud, cry my eyes out and cheer for characters' happiness. <br><br>Get over yourself. Your loss is somebody's win. Life is not only your story, and you won't always be in the spotlight. Doing your best and working hard does not guarantee best possible outcome, this works only in anime and real life is not so simple. Avoiding your fears does not magically make them go away.

discussion thread<\/a><br><br>I had a variety of expectations going into Himawari built up from all the posts I\u2019d read beforehand (I lurk the english-speaking visual novel community fora and ircs a lot). In some ways Himawari met these, in others it didn\u2019t, but blew me away where it really mattered. If you\u2019re only looking for an adequate sci-fi plot, it delivers well enough. If you\u2019re looking for characters, have no fear. The cast of this game is great to say the absolute least. Something I also expected from having read those posts were some gut wrenching water works from me. I did cry reading this game, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s the same kind of visceral tears you get from some super sad game or anime like Clannad. The last broad sweeping expectation of mine was that the game had some beautiful thematic work. I won\u2019t deny a bias here. My favorite fictional media rest almost entirely on the complex thematic-emotional spectrum, anime such as NGE, movies like Inside-Out and Gattaca, and the entire bibliography of Inio Asano (fantastic mangaka if you\u2019ve never heard of his works). The combination of the previous character and emotional notes with this promise of themes was what made me really want to get into Himawari.<br><br>And Himawari just does it. It does so so so much. Those characters and plot are good enough on their own to form a readable story, but it doesn\u2019t capture you into reading just on their significant appeal. It keeps a conversation going with you using those from nearly the very beginning. The first route keeps that game on simple terms. Who are you? What makes you you? What makes your world yours? What in your world is precious to you? What do you want out of this world? Why? Through routes these questions evolve. They get specific. Present you with a scenario in three or four different ways, give you the same question three or six times. The characters give their answers to these situations, but what is your answer to these questions? Why is it your answer? Did your answer change from last time? If so, it silently asks you why again. It never gets your answer. It doesn\u2019t tell you what answers are right or wrong. It only acknowledges the validity of them. All the while you have to see why these people in Himawari came to their answers. Their motivations and their goals. Sometimes these characters can\u2019t ever actually figure out their uncertain questions no matter how sure they are of the rest. But they\u2019re still whole. Because you don\u2019t need to know everything about yourself to be yourself. We\u2019re all growing living people finding more and more about ourselves each and everyday to become a new version of ourselves.<br><br>Himawari is a story that wants you to to be you. To want to be you. Mistakes and scars and all. It knows you can soar to close to the sun and plummet into the ocean and that perhaps you never flapped your wings even once as you fell off the cliff. Yet it still wants to pull you up to the stars anyway to see where those wings can take you. Home or the other side of the ocean. To friends, family, or purposeful solitude. To where you want to go. Because even if you never make it there, you still flew. Witnessed by all the other people who are looking forward and up, just like you.<br><br>Aaaaaand that\u2019s my attempt at summing up how Himawari feels to read. It\u2019s hard to describe the intimate experience that it is without sounding rambly or nonsensical (my initial attempt to write something after finishing the second route looks like the ravings of a madman). I mentioned earlier in this post about how Himawari managed to make me cry. It happened a couple times from plot being plot. Others it was when it managed to hit the right question. Something happening to bring me to my answer in relation to its own. It\u2019s an odd sort of emotional-thematic catharsis I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve experienced in anything other than the surrealness of the Komm Susser Todd sequence in End of Evangelion. It\u2019s an experience I can\u2019t help but hope more of you can share with me.<br><br>I realize I\u2019ve handwaved away a lot of the actual plot in that, but I think the work serves you better blind. It\u2019s hard to talk about the way things work to make these characters and their struggles so meaningfully great without taking away from the elements that make Himawari so special an experience for yourself. I want to talk about it anyway so I\u2019ll just shove it behind a spoiler tag in a comment below so I don\u2019t have to feel like I\u2019m holding something back. I guess I can say that Aqua is amazing though. Like seriously. Aqua is an unbelievably amazing character.<br><br>The last things I have to cover are basically shallow notes of whatever. Art is serviceable. There are some standout CGs even though the anatomy is almost always questionable, but at least it\u2019s bright and pretty. Music is almost entirely incidental with very few prominent tracks to add to a playlist. The comedy is usually one-liners and banter in which the characters Aqua and Ginga dominate scenes by producing absurdism after witticism until you\u2019re giggling uncontrollably. Unfortunately that\u2019s only \u201cusually\u201d, some scenes with and all scenes without those two have a lot of misses in this regard. Other cast members Youichi (the protagonist), Asuka, and Aries sit in their blobs of \u201cstraight man narrator\u201d, \u201csemi-tsundere childhood friend\u201d and \u201cditzy cute girl\u201d for most of these routines which gets old rather quickly. Additionally, Himawari is a regrettable fan of what I call \u201cthe anime gay joke\u201d where the entire joke is \u201csomething is gay <i>laughtrack<\/i>\u201d but thankfully doesn\u2019t repeat it too often, and ultimately I was more bothered by the number of times sexual harassment was played for laughs but that's just me being SJW about my media. The final comment on that aspect is that the moment to moment dialogue remains charming and fun even if it isn\u2019t the best of what \u201canime\u201d comedy has to offer.<br><br>As for overall quality of the game, the strengths are almost entire lopsided to the middle two routes. Not to say that the beginning and end are bad at all, but the first is just kinda good while the fourth is just way less of an an actively engaging story compared to the middle two. That said I do think that last route is kind of a perfect way for the story to end.<br><br>So yeah. I don\u2019t really have anything more to say after that.

You're treated to a route consisting of a hodgepodge of anime cliches you've seen at least a hundred thousand times before, including things like amnesiac protags, amnesiac girls falling from the sky, and a harem lead so bland you oftentimes find yourself wishing you were doing anything but reading this trite dialogue. How well you can withstand the game's copious amounts of slice of life comedy scenes depends on your tolerance for cute girls doing cute things -- fortunately, I consider myself quite the connoisseur, but I can understand it might be tiring for a more socially well adjusted human being than myself.<br><br>I realize that I'm sounding overly critical of a game I genuinely treasured, but I want to be upfront about the game's flaws as much as possible. It can be an uphill battle for some, especially at the beginning. But I implore those people to persevere, and I equally urge those on the fence to consider the same reckless purchase I gave this game.<br><br>The reason why becomes very clear not long after the first route -- in what has been alluded to by people more eloquent than I am with words as a Muv-Luv Alternative style 180 degree turn, the game turns around so drastically once the second route begins, you quickly feel like you're reading a completely different novel that just happens to build off the shoddy foundation the original built up. It upholds this steam throughout the second route and a vast majority of the third -- and while the fourth isn't nearly as much to write home about, it certainly isn't without its positive aspects.<br><br>While I could (and have) gushed endlessly about the ambitious scope of its incredibly enthralling sci-fi story, something that stole my heart away more than anything else is the story's willingness to give not-so-pretty traits to all its characters, heroes and heroines alike. Aqua, in particular, makes for an incredibly fascinating character (and makes for a fantastic drinking partner on exceptionally lonely nights.) (I should probably stop drinking so much.) <br><br>I hold nothing but respect for a visual novel that can give heroines some atypical traits that might turn off some of its target audience. A profound amount of characterization is gained in forcing the reader to witness what can oftentimes be ugly truths about our characters. Romance factors heavily into the game, but it isn't quite the main focus in the grand scheme of things, becoming increasingly intertwined with a twisted storyline that reveals itself in increasing complexity as the game goes on. It understands that not everything necessarily needs to have a happy ending, and the writer, Go, gained much of his notoriety for his perverse pleasure in taking his readers on an emotional rollercoaster. I, for one, can testify I became quite the emotional wreck inside at times.<br><br>I want to emphasize that, as a lifelong filthy weeb of nearly twenty-eight years, I've read more visual novels than I'm casually willing to admit to you strangers on the Internet, but little else has had me as emotionally invested as this one managed to. For characters that seemed so initially moeblob, they ended up having more characterization than I've typically come to expect from the genre. (Although, to be somewhat truthful, Aries is still pretty moeblob.) For a game that made up a ridiculous story about a Japanese astronaut landing on the moon, it was one of the most realistic depictions of the general attitude about modern day space exploration there is (but I will admit my bias as someone inordinately fascinated with space ever since I was a kid.)<br><br>I understand if you are particularly adverse to these moe-types, but if you can at all stomach it, you're certain to find a dramatic and surprisingly adult and riveting story behind all the cute fluff and slice of life hijinks (and the more attuned you are to it, the more you're likely to find great fun in those, too!) I know the words of some nobody on the Internet will do little to sway you, but if you are at all indecisive, I pray that you give it a shot. Even convincing one person to play this flawed, but wonderful masterpiece feels worth it.<br><br>And, hey, here's hoping we can get a translation of the sequel, Aqua After, one day, but for now, I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunity Manga Gamer presented me to play this.<br><br>p.s. akira is moe\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29640323', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29640323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29640323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29640323' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29640323\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29640323', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29640323_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29640323_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28486803\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198096405325\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"136139597\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bf1ee1b0f811d9840cd7f33072fdeb9a07f194f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bf1ee1b0f811d9840cd7f33072fdeb9a07f194f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/2b\/2bf1ee1b0f811d9840cd7f33072fdeb9a07f194f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198096405325\/\" data-miniprofile=\"136139597\">Slayingshot<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198096405325\/games\/?tab=all\">25 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198096405325\/recommended\/\">1 review<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198096405325\/recommended\/554290\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">64.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHimawari is one of the most heart-wrenching yet beautiful stories you will ever read. It tells a tale about characters trying to overcome the shackles of their pasts and finally putting their lives back in motion. Once it gets going, the story is amazing at hooking you in with its cool sci-fi concepts and brilliant character drama.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">\u201cYou said there was a meaning behind chasing after one\u2019s dreams. But if the dream one had been aiming for vanished into nothingness\u2026 what is one to do then?.\u201d<\/div><br>Each individual\u2019s memories are both a powerful blessing and an unrelenting curse, making it all too tempting to live on trapped by regret and past happiness rather than search for a new goal. Every single person is far from perfect, and you\u2019ll even end up shocked by the pure selfishness of their actions at times. Still, they are so painfully realistic and well-developed that you can\u2019t help but cheer for them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">\u201cWe desperately rushed towards our happy endings\u2026 but failed to grasp them.\u201d<\/div><br>Himawari is not your typical anime story. Himawari is not your typical visual novel story. No magical good end is going to wrap up all the loose ends. No one can control what happens to them in their lives, and even trying their best far from guarantees a favorable outcome. Some of the events in the game will leave you sitting in shock, cursing the injustice of the world. Yet ultimately, the characters still continue to struggle desperately to find their own source of happiness, marching forward on an unknown path where the smallest mistake can leave them plummeting back into an abyss of despair. <br><br>Even though you may be scared, even though everything ahead may be wrapped in darkness, there is still merit in moving onwards. In the end, Himawari sends a wonderful message through a heartbreaking story. <br><br>Keep going even if the first route may seem shallow and uneventful at first (the comedy is still hilarious however). The 2nd and 3rd routes combine to create an extremely immersive and profound experience. No matter what your preconceptions about visual novels, anime or cute underaged girls randomly ending up living with a parentless protagonist may be, just throw them out the window and give Himawari a shot. At the cost of sounding like a broken record, Himawari really is a unique and mature story.<br><br>Oh, and I almost forgot.

Dude has an inexplicable desire to go into space, forming a Space Club. <br>2. Cute girls join the club, humour and hijinks ensue.<br><br>You might think, oh, is this another cutesy galge? Meh. <br><br>WRONG. Houston, we have a problem.<br><br>Things devolve into a mess pretty quickly, with elements of sci-fi mystery, space opera, unforeseen violence, and complicated romances all thrown into the equation. Before you know it, you get sucked in and it's too late to get off Himawari's Wild Ride.<br><br>Strengths:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The art is of a high caliber, as expected of Frontwing (makers of the Grisaia games).<br><\/li><li>The story is fully voiced, and the English translation by Mangagamer is fantastic, despite being a fairly long novel (completion time ~30 hours)<br><\/li><li>The characters are memorable and likable. I'm not one play waifu Battleships, but Aqua looks to be the clear favorite on the interwebs. Personally I did find her route to be the most unique and enjoyable. She also looks a lot like Noire from the Neptunia series, which is pretty neat ;)<br><\/li><li>Even with the messy story, there is room for both 'feels' and comedy.<\/li><\/ul><br>Negatives:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>With the story trying to achieve so much, I did find it a bit hard to follow at times. Good thing that there's multiple routes and endings, so you'll be able to re-read parts that might be confusing.<br><\/li><li>You'll develop an allergy to sunflowers and cry whenever you see them.<\/li><\/ul><br>TL;DR: If you're looking for a quality VN with great art, plot, and sufficient length to pamper you throughout a two-way trans-Atlantic flight, Himawari would be a great choice.
