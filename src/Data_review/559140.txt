Upon firing the game up it seems like it's well suited for the touch controllers. The play area looks cool and interesting. I noticed some performance issues which shortned my play experience with it (motion sickness).  I'm running on a gtx 970, I7 4790k, Most games run well on my system but at lower settings so this could be due to lower system specs but my gut says that it's just an early access optimization aspect.  About half my shots would go up in the air and flop down onto the lane without much momentum. I suspect this is due to some kinks with performance they're working on. When my shots did register as expected it was really cool.  I could see myself playing this alot when it is more fluid. <br><br>One critique I would like to offer up is that it is mentioned this game is suited for room scale\/ standing\/ sitting experiences but currently I think it is only suited for room scale.  Perhaps they are adding ways to accommodate the other play styles? Personally I think that is really cool to aim for because I'm on the rift and while I have some mobility in my room, until I get my third sensor,  I like being able to warp around as needed.  This allows me to orient my game experience to my living room layout on the fly. For instance, my living room is wider than it is long, so I would prefer to be able to rotate my game orientation so that the direction I run towards the lanes to shoot is along the longer direction of my living room layout. <br><br>Overall I'm excited to see where this game goes.  I love vr games like this.  As the development progresses I will come back and update my review.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

It took almost a month to get this essential update out.

Disregarding the performance issues the scene i got to see looked great. It felt  like I was in a real fictional bowling ally that for some reason only has a minute amount of lanes.<br><br>I would recommend:<br>A high quality trailer (currently no video on steam, and the one video I saw was very low production\/low quality)<br>Option menu ASAP (the continuous moans and gasps of the pins can get annoying)<br>Fix performance ASAP!!
