Characters like Cao Cao and Liu Bei play a much smaller role than they otherwise would, which is interesting and changes the dynamic of the game quite a bit. There are some weird issues, but overall, this is a much better scenario than &quot;The Tyrant Returns.&quot;<br><br>Cao Cao's faction usually doesn't last long, and the Jiangdong warlords are usually next to go, though one or two of them might stave off extinction for a while by allying with Yuan Shu and focusing on Shi Xie instead. Liu BIao is in a very unlucky spot, surrounded on all sides. Even though his territory is large, once he loses a few cities, he usually falls pretty quickly to Yuan Shu. Gongsun Du, as always, ends up wiped out, this time by Liu Yu, and Shi XIe is usually targeted either by whichever Jiangdong faction survives (Wang Lang, more often than not) or Liu Yan... or both.<br><br>Some of the issues I found:<br><br>- Sun Ce and Taishi Ci already have their special bond even though Sun Ce serves Yuan Shu's faction and Taishi CI serves Liu Yao's faction.<br>- Even though Sun Ce is serving Yuan Shu, the rest of the Sun family will have to be recruited manually. They won't automatically join when they come of age.<br>- Gongsun Zan despised Liu Yu, so it seems odd to see his faction serving Liu Yu so readily. If anything, he would have either allied with Yuan Shu (his historical ally) or propped up Liu Bei as his own alternative to Liu Yu and Liu Yan.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29570445', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29570445' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29570445\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29570445' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29570445\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29570445', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29570445_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29570445_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29645774\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AquaticIdealist\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"142951396\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26893ff7fe34a56b5d3181d683974ce4b38439e6.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26893ff7fe34a56b5d3181d683974ce4b38439e6.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/26\/26893ff7fe34a56b5d3181d683974ce4b38439e6_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AquaticIdealist\/\" data-miniprofile=\"142951396\">Aqua<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AquaticIdealist\/games\/?tab=all\">1,574 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AquaticIdealist\/recommended\/\">20 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AquaticIdealist\/recommended\/573580\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was pleasantly surprised by this offering, especially since it's free.<br><br>While Koei has been lazy in terms of setting up appropriate skill sets for officers (this is especially notable in the case of Zhang Liang...  Who has no strategy rating or few any other ratings that would make him suitable as field strategist), they seem to have inputted officer placement rather fittingly here.  I know that this is a fan scenario or something, but hey, kudos to the writer\/maker.<br><br>Despite having good officers, Cao Cao's faction is in a very precarious position, sandwitched between two large empires.  Now, it seems he starts out with an alliance with Liu Yu, but we all know how long those last...  ;)<br><br>Liu Biao, as stated in another review, is also in a tough position.  And, true to form, he did not take the opportunity to claim the title of Emperor.  Despite his many cities, he has many subpar officers.  The Kuai Brothers and the likes of Wen Pin won't save him now:  Liu Yan is to the west, and Yuan Shu isn't very far in the east.<br><br>For veteran players, this is the type of scenario where Cao Cao is a real underdog, and Liu Biao is a good challenge!<br><br>For Han enthusiasts, Liu Yu has many of the traditional &quot;Han Loyalist&quot; characters, and as such represents the last great hope to restore the Dynasty.  Liu Yan is the clear alternative, but this player has noticed that his AI seems less...  Benevolent.  Coincidence?  He does have Zhang Song (obviously I suppose) and Han Sui in his ranks...<br><br>All in all there's quite a bit to like in this FREE scenario.  Although, after this review is up, Steam just might make it not free.  In the meantime, you have much to gain if you pick this up!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29645774', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29645774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29645774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29645774' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29645774\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29645774', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29645774_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29645774_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["29570445","29645774"]}
