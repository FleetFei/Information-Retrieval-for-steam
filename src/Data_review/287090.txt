You control the German forces as they try to punch through the French lines.<br><br><b>Graphics &amp; Sound<\/b><br>If you are reading this, it's likely that you're already familiar with what Battle Academy looks and sounds like. There are no real improvements in this DLC, though the new models that are used for some of the units are well made, and often feel like a small step up from the core game. <br>Sound remains mostly the same. There are, from what I can tell, no improvements here. <br><br><b>Gameplay<\/b><br>Blitzkrieg France plays very similar to the campaigns in the core game. That said, most of the levels feel more well balanced, and are just more fun to play in general due to this. Enemy placement feel fair, and there's less of the whole &quot;random AT gun that I could not predict destroys my most valuable tank as the level did not give me enough infantry to scout with&quot;. The level is still roughly in line with the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; campaign from the core game, the levels are just a bit more well balanced.<br>As Blitzkrieg France is set during the early parts of WW2,you get fewer really powerful units, which changes up the pace of the game. While some of the French tanks are tough nuts to crack, a single unit won't have the same battlefield impact as say a King Tiger, which makes the levels less luck-based, as a single lucky hit won't win or lose you the game. <br>The AI has, from what I can tell, not been improved. This is a shame, as the AI was quite bad in the main game. While each level is worth playing through at least once, it does cut down on the replay value as the AI is very predictable. Considering this is just a small expansion, this is to be expected though.<br><br><b>Closing Thoughts<\/b><br>Blitzkrieg France is a really good expansion for Battle Academy. While it does not revolutionize the game, it does fix some of the issues with the level design of the base game. It also does a good job at showing that the French army was not helpless, something that I'm sure more people than I got the impression of in high school history class. The individual French units were more than a match for their German counterparts. It was just that the French army was not well prepared for the type of warfare that was on display during the early parts of WW2.<br>Is the DLC worth getting? If you enjoyed Battle Academy, I would say absolutely! If you did not, this DLC won't change your mind. 10\u20ac for 9 levels is not a bad value, though if you intend to get the DLC for Battle Academy, you might as well go with the collection that gives you 6 DLC for the price of 2.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22216552', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22216552' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22216552\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22216552' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22216552\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22216552', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22216552_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22216552_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["22216552"]}
