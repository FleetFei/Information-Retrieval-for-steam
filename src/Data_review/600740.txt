Land Doctrine is this, but with tanks. But how does it compare to the venerable WWI Naval Simulator?<br><br>Land Doctrine is a game that, for $5, offers a good deal of enjoyment. We\u2019ll break down what it does, and follow that up with what it doesn\u2019t. If you like the thought of managing a land war, and nothing but a land war, and controlling the design philosophy, then this is your game. You are top brass in this game, someone with stars on your shoulders. Watching the fight is beyond you, all you do is see the results.<br><br>It\u2019s not a bad looking little game. Instead of hexes and turns we have a WEGO map with little armored units. Each is a battalion, of your design, that holds spaces or attacks them. Terrain matters, as does urban attacks. There can be up to four factions (including yourself) on a map that can be quite ponderous. War is immediate. You load up and go with a basic army and some even more basic tanks.<br><br>You\u2019re greeted with a basic \u201cHow-To\u201d once you start playing each game. There isn\u2019t a tutorial or the likes, nor does the game really need it.<br><br>Research is incremental and lets you choose between armor tech, infantry tech, or industrial tech. Each nation accrues research points as time goes on and then spends that on research. It\u2019s worth note that you also have to wait a period of time. This feels like a redundant mechanic. Give me one or the other.<br><br>In addition to picking research you can use what you\u2019ve learned on different tank variants. Early in the game you don\u2019t have many choices beyond just up-armoring or swapping a single gun. Later on your can experiment and see the final impacts with a wide range of variables.<br><br>Production is fairly simple. You pick how many companies you\u2019d like, the type, loadout, and support. This makes some interesting trade-offs, more troops gives a harder hitting army but now you might be light on battalions at the front.<br><br>ou\u2019ve got three presets to play with for your infantry. Prefer carbines over rifles? Or maybe you\u2019d like more anti-tank components? It does offer some interesting choices. I usually struck the middle road but I can see specialization between army groups for certain situations.<br><br>The battle system is fairly simple. Advance your own battalions, set a few variables, and then let it go. It\u2019s worth noting that some battalions move faster than others so you\u2019re fragile reserve battalion might arrive before the meatier regulars.<br><br>The resolution is heavy on the details for each phase. This reads rather like a battle report from a Grigsby game. At each phase-range you get to see how your forces performed and what sort of casualties you incurred. The winner remains in position while the loser retreats. If those loser retreats into another hostile army it is destroyed. If your armies can arrive at the next destination before the shattered army, it\u2019s destroyed. This feels like an unintentional blitzkrieg mechanic.<br><br>Finally you get a summary from your troops on the ground. In a lot of grog games it\u2019s hard to tell what worked. Even in Rule the Waves you sometimes have no clue if a certain battleship was all that effective. Here at least you get some instant feedback and can use that to gauge the effectiveness of your forces.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Bummers<\/div><br>One thing that sets Rule the Waves and Children of a Dead Earth apart is a tactical layer build on top of a research layer. Not only do you get to steer the research, perform the design, but you can also play as the Admiral or star marshall. You get a deep down, visceral, in your face, example of the prowess of your forces. (Or lack thereof). You can try a crazy design of just casemate guns on all of your battleships. Or you can tinker with huge engines and just railguns.<br><br>In Land Doctrine we get a summary and no visual of what\u2019s going on. I can understand why, but it still makes me yearn for a Rule the Waves type game that let\u2019s me play with crazy designs and watch them get destroyed.<br><br>Combat feels a bit off. One engagement will seem like a surefire win and ends up being a total rout, and another battle is the total opposite. Though it seems to be very player dependent as I\u2019ve heard some people spend hours and have a really fair match up.<br><br>My biggest issue is lack of a run up. A year long cold war would allow the player to steer research and get a wildly different game without having to survive the initial onslaught. The AI seems either suicidally aggressive or docile. One game I found myself attacked on all fronts while in another everything seemed chill. The chill game let me play with more designs and it was a more satisfying game.<br><br>For it\u2019s few flaws it\u2019s a surprisingly solid game. Sure I can complain about it not having a tank-on-tank physics simulator, but it\u2019s not what the game set out to do. For just $5 it\u2019s a damned good deal.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30651528', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30651528' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30651528\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30651528' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30651528\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30651528', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30651528_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30651528_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/recommended\/600740\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30667943\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"42275100\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a339586a259a54ebbd228c5fd1b91ce305656d54.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a339586a259a54ebbd228c5fd1b91ce305656d54.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a3\/a339586a259a54ebbd228c5fd1b91ce305656d54_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/\" data-miniprofile=\"42275100\">Quasi Z<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/games\/?tab=all\">195 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/recommended\/\">15 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002540828\/recommended\/600740\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLand Doctrine is literally a digital board game. The elegant rules create an experience that is epic in scale, intriguing in complexity, and filled with meaningful decisions. <br><br>There is no tutorial, but the manual is concise and illustrated. By wargame standards it's a brief and easy read, with the various systems all being simple and intuitive. <br><br>The result is a mix of realism and abstraction that is uniquely compelling. Battles offer a rarely seen level of clarity and decisiveness. Combat in other games often becomes a muddle of +\/- modifiers; one blob of units ultimately being just as effective as another. Here each battalion has distinct advantages and disadvantages. <br><br>Complaints that you can't field a mix of tanks and infantry in each battalion miss the beauty of this system. Limiting each battalion to one type of tank and one infantry loadout doesn't limit you, it defines them. This in turn challenges you to develop and deploy each battalion to its maximum potential. <br><br>Your enjoyment of the game will be hampered by its sometimes convoluted user interface. Where operation Market Garden went a bridge too far, Land Doctrine's interface often goes a click too deep. And much like those doomed paratroopers, at times you'll be cut off from what you want, just when you need it most. The game is never unplayable, but accessing info can sometimes become tedious.  <br><br>With a few interface enhancements, Land Doctrine is the kind of game Slitherine would publish at quadruple the cost. Especially, if each battalion's 3D model represented the actual tank and infantry type. <br><br>Keep in mind, this isn't a Civ-style, peacefully build up, and unleash the perfect war machine, kind of game. Instead, you're thrust into the middle of a war, and the odds are stacked against you. Even the Easy difficulty is a tough fight for an inexperienced commander. <br><br>Starting out, your T1 Rabbit tank is actually an armored car with delusions of grandeur. The frontline is a mishmash of regulars and reserves armed with a motley assortment of misfit toys. To top it off, there is nothing in the R&amp;D pipeline, and your production lines are impersonating the Titanic as they churn straight into disaster.<br><br>With such an intense challenge, there is a lot of fun to be had here. Every action has far reaching consequences. There is no perfect tank, infantry, battalion, weapon, strategy or tactic that always ensures victory. Truly, everything must be done at its right time, and in its right place.
