Don't expect it to be just like Terraria or Starbound. It is similar enough for you to enjoy but takes an entirely different route when it comes to combat. The combat system is unique and smooth.

Aside from a few performance issues and a couple bugs (such as spawning in the ground or ceiling under certain circumstances) it's pretty solid, both gameplay and mechanically. The four classes are fun and each have enjoyable weapons, and the abilities you can gain are quite useful. It may seem like you have no story when you start off, but you slowly uncover the tale of the land as you gain pages such as long-lost letters and forgotten story pages. Overall an enjoyable, if incomplete, game. I would definitely reccomend buying it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30498214', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30498214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30498214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30498214' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30498214\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30498214', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30498214_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30498214_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary30805859\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053653124\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"93387396\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a7\/a7c882d6f753ee262142c2ce16af3e1e5eb273e9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a7\/a7c882d6f753ee262142c2ce16af3e1e5eb273e9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a7\/a7c882d6f753ee262142c2ce16af3e1e5eb273e9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053653124\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93387396\">Agrias Oaks<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053653124\/games\/?tab=all\">39 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053653124\/recommended\/\">28 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198053653124\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThus far this game has exceeded ALL of my expectations!

The crafting system is more along the lines of Starbound, you have to unlock the recipes, and you'll spend plenty of time unlocking all recipes. The building feels familiar, and while there are no impending threats (pirates, goblins, etc... attacking your base, or even zombies at night or even ANYTHING moving to attack you) there are plenty of enemies and they can certainly be difficult, especially when you're out numbered!<br><br>The dev, Jasson, is AWAYS diligently working on the game and is very friendly and transparent!

I've been part of the Crea community for a very long time now and I finally got around to updating my review. I'm going to go through the features of the game and talk a little bit about them so you know a little about the game beforehand.<br><br>Important Note: Since I wrote this review I've become part of the Crea development team. As such I won't be updating this review further as I feel that being part of the development team would result in a biased review. That said, this review was written at a time when I was not part of the development team. So the original review still stands in its integrity. It is worth noting that many things about the game have changed since the review, so it's no longer necessarily accurate.<br><br>First of all, let's talk the game's origins. This game originally started with the idea of &quot;Terraria but moddable&quot; according to the dev. Since then it's changed wildly. The game is still a 2D sandbox game (and indeed to many people that's enough to make it practically the same as Terraria) but it has integration of RPG elements and a strong emphasis on exploration.<br><br>Next let's discuss the combat. The combat in Crea is very dynamic, a lot of dodging and blocking, and with a lot of skills for you to use. There are even combos, and there are several different paths you could go in terms of combat. However it does take some getting used to which may be a downside for many people. The combat in the game has a different patterning compared to most other 2D games that makes you watch the enemy closely and react to their patterns in order to attack optimally. While not similar to Dark Souls combat, the difference between Dark Souls combat and standard 3rd person combat in video games is a good comparison. It requires you to engage enemies differently from any other 2D game I've played, and it requires you to think about what you're doing actively. This isn't for everybody, so just know what you're getting into, and know you'll have to think if you want to fight well in Crea.<br><br>Next is the crafting. Crea takes a new approach to crafting compared to other sandboxes, in that you discover the recipes by researching the pieces of the items themselves. The end result of this is that finding a new recipe is more like a scavenger hunt than anything else, as you look for the piece that completes your recipe. Some people love this while unfortunately this comes off to others as grindy. I personally believe this is a presentation issue, and the developer has discussed doing massive changes to the crafting system to improve it, so that may see changes in the future.<br><br>Next is exploration. Exploring in Crea is something that it often feels like there is a good reason to do, in fact, it almost always feels as such. While it doesn't feel like exploration is the core of the game (as, indeed, it isn't), exploration is rewarded, and required. The materials you need are not centered in a small place, they're all over the world, and should you decided to spend most of your time underground, the tunnels always feel more like you're spelunking, than anything else.<br><br>The next big piece is modding. This game has possibly the best mod support I've ever seen, so in the future, there will likely be a wide range of different ways you can play the game, all through modding. Of course that does first require that a community forms, which is something to keep in mind, but if one does form you'll see modding content created much faster and more seamlessly than most other games out there.<br><br>The next thing I'm going to talk about is my least favorite thing in the game, the primary toolbar. While many people like the strange toolbar that Crea opted to go with, my personal opinion is that it's not the best. The toolbar at the bottom has two modes which each have two loadouts. There's a combat and exploration mode. You switch between the modes with R and the loadouts with tab. It's clunky when you start but as you get used to it becomes efficient. That said, I'm a bigger fan of the simplicity offered by a single toolbar. I think that simplifying the toolbar would benefit the game greatly.<br><br>Next is something I feel I should discuss in this review. This game had a rough launch. I'm going to briefly tell the story of what happened though from my perspective. Leading up to the launch the game looked very stable. The developer was looking for bugs and encouraging people to test it, but none were showing up (or rather no one was reporting them if they were). I know this since I was (and still am) a moderator of the forums. As far as the developer could tell, the game was stable. As such, he left early access. On leaving early access the amount of people playing the game increased a hundredfold. Literally the number of people playing Crea was about 100 times greater than it was during early access. Because of this many, many bugs appeared. For some people the game was refusing to run, for others it crashed often, for some the multiplayer was unplayable. It was a mess. The main developer was distraught and spent a ton of time fixing bugs. He was constantly working his way through a list of bugs for over a month after launch, and these weren't small bugs. For a couple of them, he had to do things such as completely rewrite the netcode for the game. Anyone who's even tried to program netcode knows that's no small feat. The developer several times worked from 9 AM one day to 3 AM the next to fix the bugs. The community watched him do it to, it's common for the developer of the game to livestream the development in order to interact more readily with his community (and contrary to some accusations I've seen, the developer definitely doesn't play favorites if people subscribe or donate. In fact I don't even think most of the people subscribed own Crea, they just like to chat as they code....) The game is now stable. Watching the reports, there hasn't been a crash report in a while. I won't say the game's perfect, it's a long way off. Getting the game stable is only now (July of 2016) getting close to wrapping up and after that the game still needs a lot more content and needs some systems reworked before it's full potential is available, but it will get there. I've been along as this game was developed for a long time and the developer has consistently shown he puts the playerbase first. He takes feature requests, he actively engages in solving bugs that only plague one person, he requests feedback on ideas before implementing them, he listens to player feedback and reverts changes that people don't like. If nothing else, I have confidence in what this game will become because I've seen the developer in action and he's exactly what most people wish the developer of their favorite game was like.<br><br>Crea is not for everyone, but I think many people will enjoy it, if not now, then in the future.<br><br>Anyway, long story short, I'd recommend this game (if you somehow didn't get that already).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17243046', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17243046' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17243046\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17243046' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17243046\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17243046', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17243046_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17243046_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t178 of 224 people (79%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary10285992\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"95505872\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a46af1561a993baaa069a30dfb705415d5204fd9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a46af1561a993baaa069a30dfb705415d5204fd9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a4\/a46af1561a993baaa069a30dfb705415d5204fd9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/\" data-miniprofile=\"95505872\">frannyan<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/games\/?tab=all\">248 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/FranNyan\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">160.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while Crea was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: May 30, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCrea is a sandbox exploration and building game, much like Minecraft and Terraria. Unlike Minecraft, it's 2d and doesn't suffer from 3d camera troubles, and unlike Terraria, it's multiplatform, so it can be played Linux native.  It also adds RPG elements so you can level up, focus on your skill sets and chose between various different armor and weapon types depending on your play style.  <br><br>Weapon classes: Each weapon class has it's own upgrade tree that branches off towards the top into a variety of top tier weapons<br> - Sword\/melee: Your normal hack and slash. <br> - Pike\/melee: Stabbing from a slight distance<br> - Wand\/magic:  Sling spells without using MP<br> - Bow \/ Range:  Plink away out of range.<br><br>In addition, there's magic, which can be used alongside your weapon which comes in both offensive (fireballs and the like) and defensive (healing, shielding, etc)  <br><br>Armour types have a similar branching tree that the weapon classes do.  There's basic armor, then it branches off to give the choice of 3 top level armors.   <br><br>Weapons, armor and mining tools can all have bonuses, something that you can put your skill points into improving. Like in an RPG, not all items are the same, which means you can almost always make better equipment as you continue to level. This gives a nice feeling of progression to the game.<br><br>Like Terraria, there is a boss battle that changes up the world a little.  However, this is mostly an upgrade without the race against the clock aspect battling the Wall of Flesh gave.  A new ore is peppered through the world, and a new category of drops is added to the mobs, allowing for higher level equipment.<br><br>The monsters in the game scale to your level, rather than being procedural. A low level character will always encounter lower level monsters and vice versa no matter where in the world they happen to be.  <br><br>As a benefit to exploring, Crea has a built in fast travel\/teleport system. Way crystals can be set as spawn points and as long as you carry a shard with you, you can always teleport back home.  Way crystals are in random locations across the world and under the surface, making it much easier to get back to digging through the cave system. <br><br>Crea is also very easily moddable.  Items can be created, the game files tinkered with, near anything you want can be done.  The official forum has a section for people to swap mods and get advice on how to make their own. Even with almost no programing knowledge, it's pretty easy to look at the source files and fiddle with things until you get the result you want. <br><br>Crea is still in beta, but it's a very active beta with a very active dev and decently active community that's pretty good at pinning down the bugs and coming up with possible workarounds until the official patch comes out.  Most bug fixes are pretty swift it arriving, especially when they're big ones.  It's very playable as is. Multiplayer is still a bit wonky as of this review, but it was recently given a complete overhaul and I assume will be fixed up as the dev has a very good track record in that respect. <br><br><br>Overall, a very enjoyable addition to the genre and very worth getting.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('10285992', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '10285992' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary10285992\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '10285992' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary10285992\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '10285992', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10285992_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary10285992_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t113 of 132 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">4 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>15 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23479602\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"118973053\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e84e49606749f75eee914ab8bf8c6f4e2db23422.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e84e49606749f75eee914ab8bf8c6f4e2db23422.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/e8\/e84e49606749f75eee914ab8bf8c6f4e2db23422_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/\" data-miniprofile=\"118973053\">Driftan<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/games\/?tab=all\">207 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/driftan\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">120.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCrea is a project developed by two very passionate people; Jasson McMorris <i>(Programmer)<\/i> and his wife, Kelley <i>(Artist\/Animator)<\/i>. Ever since discovering the game in early 2014, Jasson has been more than open and honest with how updates are coming along and has never left followers of the game in the dark. He's even constantly live streaming on Twitch, showing himself working on the game and taking feedback from his viewers in real time <i>(he streams under the name SiegeGames)<\/i>. Jasson is also quick to fix both big and small bugs reported by users.<br><br>SiegeGames is a damn good development team that truly cares for both the product and its fans. Crea is addicting, containing hundreds of hours of content <i>(crafting, building, extensive player\/skill leveling, researching, exploring, boss fights, different ecosystems with their own unique enemies and resources, multiplayer, randomly generated dungeons, speeps, etc)<\/i>. Jasson is great at Public Relations, is hard working and respects his fans who have both positive and negative things to say, the music is catchy to listen to <i>(Props to Clark Powell)<\/i>, the enemy and boss designs are unique and well animated <i>(Props to Kelley)<\/i> and the updates and bug fixes just keep rolling in.<br><br>Honestly, take the dive and enjoy such a wonderfully crafted game. I've only partaked in the singleplayer experience <i>(3 different character playthroughs throughout the development of the game)<\/i>, so I can assure you that it's still very enjoyable playing alone. Hell, it's nice to just listen to a podcast and relax while escaping into the world of Crea.<br><br>Also, there's no blowfish that chuckles at you when you start up the game everytime, so that's a huge plus.<br><br>EDIT: Others who have reviewed the game, both positively and negatively, make much more thoughtful and indepth points relating to the game itself.

Combat, mining, building, and crafting in a 2D world. It's similar to Terraria, which is what interested me, but far far from a clone. It's early access, so expect bugs. Luckily, the developer is very active on the forums. He is very helpful, and I've personally watched him solve three or four bugs on his twitch stream. I believe he spends hours every day with his stream up, and anyone can come in and inform him of difficulties they're having. I also think he has promised to release updates every week, however some weekly updates might only be bug fixes.<br><br>In Crea, your character gains xp on each monster kill and levels up. Each level up gives 2 stat points, and you can spend them on health, stamina, attack, defense, intelligence (matk), mind (mdef), agility (ranged), and luck. I would say the coolest thing about Crea is the talent system. You have a talent tree for Arms (swords, axes, and bows), Syle (magic), Gathering (mining), Crafting, and Exploring (double jump, lockpick, inventory boost, and other noncombat boosts).<br><br>Combat is, like I said, similar to Terraria. At least the controls are. Left click to pew, but with each click of an attack or use of a skill, your character's stamina will drain. If you allow your stamina to reach zero, your movement speed is reduced and you cannot act until it reachs about half. So always stop attacking before you reach zero. <br><br>Currently there are swords, spears, bows, and wands. Each weapon style has a standard left-click attack, and then each weapon has the possibility of dropping with an element (earth, wind, water, fire), as well weapons can have secondary attributes (piercing bow, lifesteal sword, damage buff on kill axe, ricochet bullets, etc.).<br><br>Two very important commands would be the ability to block and dodge. Dodge causes your character to roll forward or backward with invincibility frames. Blocking reduces the damage you take from an attack. Combat also has skills, unlike Terraria. Active skills such as fireball, shield stun, triple shot, protect, raise (multiplayer), heal, etc. Passive skills include stat increases, weapon power increases, shield power increases, move while charging, move while blocking, etc. Passives are boring, but useful.<br><br>Mining is mining. Grab pick, mine ore, build better pick, mine better ore, etc. It works. Currently I've discovered the ore progression bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Not sure what's after gold, or how many ores come after gold. I've heard people mention Corium, which I believe may be the endgame ore. I'll skip over the building aspect, since it's never interested in me.<br><br>Crafting is fairly simple as well, at least the act of crafting is. You just open the window, click a recipe you've unlocked, and clicked craft. Where Crea sets itself apart from others is the act of unlocking recipes, which is very in-depth, but also pretty annoying at times. Recipes have a crafting level I believe, but you can't see what level they are. Whether or not you gain crafting experience is dependant on the level of item your crafting. <br><br>You have to research recipes using base materials. So if there was an iron pick, and it required wood and an iron bar, you'd need wood and an iron bar. You would also need to be a high enough crafting level to unlock crafting iron picks. Then you'd approach the research table, and it would say that you can currently research iron bars and you can research wood. You research with the wood, it tells you you've learned part of the iron pick recipe. You research with iron bar, it tells you you've learned the entire recipe for iron pick. Then you can craft the iron pick.<br><br>If you have half of a recipe unlocked, you can view it in the research table and you'll see a dark shadow of the other items required. You might recognize them. If you don't feel like hunting down or finding out what else is required, then you can spend Scraps to finish the recipe without researching. This will unlock the recipe. Scraps are obtained when you research normally.<br><br>Another awesome aspect is the dungeon system. You can sometimes find portals to dungeons in the world, and sometimes they spawn when you break a monster spawner. Another method is to unlock the Dungeoneer NPC, and paying him in currency and stone to send you into a dungeon. You can pick and choose the dungeon difficulty, size, and modifiers, or click the random button. Dungeons are awesome for finding loot you haven't unlocked and for grinding experience.<br><br>Gripes:<br>I can't seem to unlock the next tier of wands, and I don't know if it's because I don't have the materials or because I don't have a high enough crafting level. I can craft better swords, bows, and axes than I can wands, and I'm playing a mage build character. Without crafting levels displayed on the crafting window, I don't know what items to even craft to level up my crafting. <br><br>Magic, melee, and range do not seem to be very balanced. I haven't managed to use melee successfully at all. Magic is decent, but pales in comparison to similarly leveled range (range is 3-4 times more powerful, for sure). However range requires the crafting of arrows, and I have a hard time crafting enough to keep up with my dungeoneering (as far as I know, feathers only drop from birds one at a time, and I don't see them very often). Stamina drains very very fast, but you get used to it. It's a real bother when fighting the plants that multiply if you don't break the eggs in time.<br><br>Silver seems to be more rare than gold, as I have found way more gold than silver on two different characters in two different worlds. Five ore per bar is not a big deal with bronze and iron, but at the silver and gold levels it feels like way too much. Character leveling (not talent) feels a bit too slow. <br><br>All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. It's not very expensive, and it's definitely very fun. I will be putting way more hours into Crea.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19768711', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19768711' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19768711\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19768711' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19768711\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19768711', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19768711_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19768711_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30937536\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/greatfluffykitty\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"67898112\">Dietrich Katt<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 20.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: April 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWord of advice: Don't compare it to any other game, its a nice little gem with a simple thing in mind.<br><br>It has a huge learning curve in it but I believe the latest updates have made it so that it isn't brainwracking to build a simple bow.

I can't say cons except for, maybe, the easy bosses. Why? Well the game is in &quot;Alpha&quot; state, so that means it's in development, so bugs and issues will be during this phase. So i will be waiting for the patch to say if the game has been improved, or maybe, some of the issues were taken care off. But the game has a really nice crafting system, a nice lvling system, including a rebirth thingy to get even stronger during the time u spend in the game. It has bosses, minibosses, mini minibosses (paragons), although they are in small numbers, in a further update i think more will be added. It has dungeons, dungeon spawner, creep spawner. <br>It's an interesting game that's worth ur time if u understand the concept of &quot;Alpha&quot; or &quot;In development&quot;. Otherwise is not worth ur time, until it will be out of testing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30039758', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30039758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30039758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30039758' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30039758\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30039758', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30039758_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30039758_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29986501\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Heartsworth\/recommended\/280520\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"83064183\">Heartsworth<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 30.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[UPDATE]<br>So Jasson released a update and the game is working beautifully. There are some fps dips on game start but it WILL go away! The gui has been reworked and works wonderfully! To some older players who have a game crash on launch just unsub some\/all of the mods for the game and it should run.<br><br>The game at times can feel like a grind but in my personal opinion it is not a &quot;bad&quot; kind of grind. It is quite rewarding and makes you want to put in the hours to get somewhere. The talent system is awesome and while I do feel that more talents should be added I also feel that it is not necessary just yet. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of different talents and trust me it will take a while to get them all.<br><br>I have noticed that at first it may feel the enemies are OP to some but you can block, dodge or later on cast protection spells + healing spells,potions or food which will benefit you in a fight.<br><br>Honestly after the most recent update I can full on recommend this to anyone. The devs are constantly communicating and their attitudes are great so all in all you can expect things to be fixed if something goes wrong.<br><br>If you love 2D adventure games with magic and beautiful art + music and mod support then you should for sure try Crea.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29986501', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29986501' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29986501\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29986501' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29986501\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29986501', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29986501_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29986501_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_container multiple_listing store\" id=\"ReviewDevResponserecent_short29986501\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_exists_date\">A developer has responded on Feb 17 @ 8:37am<br><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Heartsworth\/recommended\/280520\/#developer_response\">(view response)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: both;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/280520\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 722 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30416508","30540531","30830170","30498214","30805859","30710792","17243046","10285992","23479602","19768711"]}
