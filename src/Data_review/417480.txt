The game itself is aimed at the hardened platformer rather than the casual gamer. Being of the latter I was expecting to replace another window in my house but my controller stayed firmly in my hand in what was an unexpected enjoyable playthrough! <br><br>You play Marcus in a side scrolling jumping platformer collecting Chokobongos while dishing out attack moves against foes that stand in your way. The developer purposely doesn\u2019t give too much away as to how you get through a level as I found at my own peril. For example, to reach a certain platform out of jump range I had to use jump and attack! The game itself has enough replay value that it is easily worth the \u00a33.99 as being able to collect enough badges to explore the 4 worlds through 20 levels will mean you will be exploring the same level just to find those hidden secrets not to mention help in the form of bonuses to unlock the Expert Mode challenge and the next world. The game has a nicely animated cartoon style to it and the music although a little repetitive suits the genre style.<br><br>There were some minor issues that did let it down. Through a level you can get the chance to turn into a frog or cloud that then changes the gameplay into a flappy bird clone. I found this to be the biggest drawback purely as you have no direct control over his movement other than bashing a button which made these particular stages frustrating especially when you are trying to collect everything! There were a few glitches where I had got stuck on an object and had no choice but to restart, but issues aside you are getting your money\u2019s worth with this title! As I am sure the Developer will update and fix any anomalies. <br><br>For hardened gamers who like their platform games and completing levels will be in their element but if you are a casual gamer like me, you will find Marcus Level more enjoyable in shorter playing times! I have a video of the first two levels just so you can get an idea of style and gameplay!<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7p8h-C1UF8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7p8h-C1UF8E<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20765865', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20765865' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20765865\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20765865' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20765865\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20765865', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20765865_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20765865_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/417480\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 11 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["20765865"]}
