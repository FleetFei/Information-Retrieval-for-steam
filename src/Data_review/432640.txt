And it's decent...<br>I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed either of these titles... <br><br>Your shelter\/resource contains the genetics of TWOM, including: crafting. cooking, defense, sleep\/exaughtion, weather\/temp, and health\/mental upkeep. The military-time day\/night counter runs continuosly, with every task requiring said amount of time to complete. It's a pretty basic formula for those familiar with TWOM, mostly proritizing what to build to initially survive versus the race to prepare for, and survive, the oncoming winter...<br><br>The DNA of ZH:D is found in the travel\/exploration\/combat aspect of the game. Diffrent area nodes will become available as you progress in the game. It consists of timed travel, requiring a few hours to traverse the debris to each destination. Each node has a set number of rooms to explore for potential resources required to survive, occasionally finding secret areas, or you could get attacked... Battle is pure RNG with fast flavor text, there is no &quot;action&quot; here. <br><br>Before initializing combat, a threat level is given indicating the severity of the encounter. Low threat means fewer and weaker zombies, with higher threat levels sometimes raising not only enemy numbers but their severity. And yes, you can avoid battles by either not walking into the next room containing zombies or by running away if attacked while traveling. Enemies will usually start four meters away. As the distance closes, you will fire your ranged weapon, if you have one, and then engage in melee combat until victory or defeat. Ammo is universal for each gun, but save those bullets for tougher battles later in game...<br><br>This is a tough little cookie, but doable after you figure out how to proritize your base growth. Also, there are crucial NPC's that will eventually appear asking for resources. Each can be visited at a stationary node after they make initial contact, trading necessary materials and accepting favored items as gifts to raise your companionship level. Higher levels means not only better trades, but also more varied items. Dont ignore your neighbors...<br><br>All in all this is an enjoyable game if you don't mind rage-quitting a window mode only mobile port with little to no feed back from the developer. I'd sorely love to see a full screen mode with a pause option, other than the quit\/continue screen, in shelter strictly for viewing resources\/stats, but the non-stop timer otherwise adds to the direness of the situation. Also, while outside of your sheleter, there is no way of identifying the materials you gather. Some icons are self explanitory, such as food and wood, but otherwise it's memorization of what's what till you get it home to inspect... <br><br><br>All negative reviews and aspects aside, I personally rate BuriedTown 3.5 out of 5...\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21531496', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21531496' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21531496\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21531496' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21531496\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21531496', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21531496_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21531496_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20805394\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/51\/5136a08b5c2b1a6ea164615e3ba421bb6f95380c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/\" data-miniprofile=\"93522403\">genkipro<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/games\/?tab=all\">3,920 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/\">130 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/genkipro\/recommended\/432640\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>BuriedTown is a fun casual game that doesn't really fit that well into any of the most common genre definitions. The Steam game page for BuriedTown suggests that some popular user-defined tags for it are as follows: Action, RPG, Strategy, Indie, Adventure. But this really doesn't define it well at all.<br><br>In BuriedTown, you are a survivor of a zombie outbreak. There's no information provided in game regarding where you came from, how you managed to avoid the zombie virus (?) outbreak, or even who you are, but none of these things is really important for playing the game anyway.<br><br>BuriedTown has received some pretty negative reviews on Steam, but in my opinion they're not really justified. The game is addictive in its own way, but it is also frustrating. A short run of bad luck can have terrible consequences, ruining in just a minute or two a game that you have been playing for over an hour. But it's pretty original and has reasonably high production values.<br><br>Coming into this review after reading some of the others I was expecting the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Graphics - The graphics in BuriedTown are a bit of a mixed bag. No, there are no graphics options, and no, you can't play it in full-screen graphics mode. BuriedTown opens up in a resizable window and doesn't know anything about bloom or HDR or ambient occlusion. There aren't even any fancy animations to speak of! Instead, the game's graphics take the form of a number of stylised icons that all fit within a single theme, placed over two-dimensional still backgrounds. And in my opinion, they're mostly quite nicely done, and fit the game well.<br><br>The game screen is divided into two sections, with various statistics, your character's five attributes or needs, and a status window on the right; and the relevant world screen on the left: either your home, the world map, the current location you're visiting, or one of the utility screens used for combat, inventory management, improving your shelter, etc.<br><br>It took me my first game to familiarise myself with the meaning behind each icon and the features represented by the graphics, but once I had encountered each one once, that was enough.<br><br>Sound - I believe there's only one music track used throughout BuriedTown, but it fits the mood of the game very well: a sort-of gently mournful instrumental piece that's blended nicely with a thunderstorm. I haven't yet found myself bored with it, and it blends into the background while playing. The game's sound effects are not quite so good, with zombie combat sounds especially being extremely repetitive and lacking. Other sounds in the game tend to alert you to your character's status changing (usually for the worse), and are passable, but nothing special.<br><br>Gameplay - The goal of BuriedTown is to survive for as long as you can. You start in an abandoned house that you call home, and each day you need to maintain your character's five needs (mood, energy, hunger, infection, and injury) while exploring the mostly abandoned town outside your door. <br><br>Unfortunately it's not quite as simple as it seems, with your mood, energy, and hunger constantly decreasing and requiring you to find and use various resources recovered from the town in order to replenish them. This usually results in your other needs -- infection and injury -- taking a hit from the zombies you'll randomly encounter while exploring, which then prompts you to find still more resources to replenish these needs as well. And so on.<br><br>To explore the town you leave your shelter and select a destination. The game gives you a confirmation screen showing how long it will take your character to reach the destination, and away you go. Once you arrive at your destination, you can there explore up to a certain number of times for each location, either encountering zombies that you must fight or discovering a hidden cache of loot. The town's locations are the same each play through, which I found a little disappointing, but I was pleased to discover that the encounters for each location seemed to be at least partly randomised.<br><br>And that's basically it. The central idea is very simple, but well executed, if perhaps a tad too difficult for my liking. My first game I lasted two and a half days, my second almost double that, and then in my third I survived for over 12 days before falling afoul of a continuous run of zombies in the local movie theatre. But each game was a precarious dance of balancing needs, collecting loot, automated zombie battles, and crossed fingers -- hardly a relaxing pasttime. <br><br>The game is quick enough to play just for a few minutes and then put down again, but addictive enough to keep you busy for hours if you let it. The implemented Steam achievements and in-game trophies increase the addictiveness, as would the world-wide ranking list, if I could get it to work.<br><br>The whole game is played with the mouse pointer and left mouse button and could easily have been made for a mobile device, which I believe it originally was. But it works well on Windows, too, and once you've learned what all of the icons do you'll find the interface simple and straightforward.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n-------------------------------------PROS &amp; CONS------------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>Pros:<br>+ Addictive gameplay with both in-game trophies and Steam achievements, as well as a ranking system<br>+ Great music<br>+ Simple interface that's very easy to learn<br>+ Stable: no crashes or bugs encountered yet<br>+ Translation to multiple languages, if you want to play in something other than English<br><br>Cons:<br>- Ranking system doesn't seem to work; ranking lists are always empty<br>- Very hard; there are Steam achievements awarded for surviving whole seasons! I thought I was doing well making it through 12 days ...<br>- Locations are the same every game, making it more repetitive than it otherwise could be, although encounters and loot do change<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">==========================================================<br>\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------<br>\n==========================================================<\/div>I'm going to go against the general feeling of the other English reviews on Steam and say that BuriedTown is a really good little game. I've only played it for a couple of hours so far, but I can easily see myself playing it for quite a few more, struggling to survive just that little bit longer, upgrading my shelter and befriending other survivors as I go.<br><br>Is it an action adventure RPG, as suggested by the current popular user-defined tags on the Steam page? Most definitely not, in my opinion.
