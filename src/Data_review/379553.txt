This plane is basically just the D.ii except for stealing the idea of a smaller lower wing on a different chord line, from the French Nieuport's . It was a cool concept, and made the plane a breeze to pilot, but the lower wing was getting way too stressed. Manfred von Richthofen scored quite a few kills in this plane.<br><br>OK so good and bad. <br><br>CONS:<br>It doesn't want to spin in an overspeed stall like wikipedia tells me it should, and it makes sense that it should with the sesqui wing (I couldn't get it fast enough with my realsm effects, maybe turning off aircraft stress might emulate this... would be awesome to experience. Let me know if you get it to work, or can induce an overspeed spin from a dive. please.)<br>Obviously the wings don't break off from the insane stress from wild turns and the tail won't break in half if you slam it against the runway like it should.<br>The rudder SLAM is like WHOA (Actually sooo so fun)<br><br>PROS:<br>Flies like a baby Cessna with minimal instruments<br>You get to see the valve lifters all the time<br>Stalls and recovers as expected besides the high speed stall<br><br><br>You feel like a real pilot sitting in this thing. There is open air around you, your radiator is ominously mounted right above your head. Your 'big six' is now just two instruments, RPM's and an 'altimeter' I wouldn't bet on. Instead of trim, you can lock your stick in a certain position. When you're flying, you can hear the RPM's ramping up as you descend. The wood trim is something you'd expect from a Bugatti. The point the immersion ends is that you know the monocoque tail won't be breaking off if you accidentally slam the tail against the runway.<br>You taxi to RW 14, and push the throttle  gradually fully forwards, holding the right rudder steady as you speed up to keep center of the runway. You can lift off quickly, but with no speed indicator, I'd recommend flying parallel to the runway for a bit before ascending.<br>So I flew a few rough patterns, the altimeter seemed off... or stuck, or wrong.... I know what 2k looks like and it was still saying 1k, sooo who know? Anyways, I flew two paterns, the first one I approached visually like I was in a Cessna, but I didn't get my tail wheel down quick enough (The angle of the wings with the tail wheel on the ground is what's going to slow your roll the quickest). I over ran the runway by maybe 10 feet (no brakes, no flaps, no pre reading, hahah) on a 6k ft rw. My second go I was able to exit rw about midfield, I slowed down in air a bit more and lowered the tailwheel as lift was diminishing.<br><br>The Rudder throws this little wooden plane around wildly. With some practice I think you could get some wild stalls with how powerful this rudder is (I think it would break the plane IRL).<br>I tried some stalls... in power off stalls, I was getting very out of control spins, although they were easily recovered with sufficient altitude. The super rudder helps.<br>I tried some power on stalls, the plane really favors rolling over left wing and stalling in a CCW spin. <br>I was reaching overspeeds before I could speed stall her.<br><br>So I only flew this plane about an hour, but I enjoyed some things about it, and disliked other things that can't be fixed in FSX.<br>The plane is a joy to fly, the left tendencies on takeoff are fun, and learning the feeling of the landing could be a good thing to experience if you're into conventional gear aircraft.  The plane is more fragile than FSX can emulate, and that's a real bummer, but not a complete deal breaker for me. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('19719106', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '19719106' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary19719106\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '19719106' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary19719106\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '19719106', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19719106_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary19719106_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["19719106"]}
