It's actually a very old game now (I first played the game back in the mid 1990s and have played it ever since) but in recent times the developer has made mobile versions of the game, before finally porting that version back to PC and onto Steam.  It would be accurate to say that I've accrued <i>thousands<\/i> of hours playing versions of the game since 1995, and I don't regret buying this newer version if only by way of thanking the developer for all those lost hours of the last 20+ years!<br><br>Gameplay is simple: try to populate as many hexagons as possible.  Each hexagon you control gives you spending points for more attacking soldiers or defending towers to play.  Merge two of your soldiers together to upgrade them, but an upgraded soldier needs more supporting hexagons to keep him alive, so don't upgrade too many too fast!  Otherwise, one hexagon stolen by an opponent could kill off your entire army!  As well as securing more hexagons, you must be ready to defend the hexagons you already control, because leaving them undefended will mean another player is guaranteed to take them.  Adding to the problem are trees that will spawn on hexagons of dead soldiers, spreading outwards in every direction on each turn.  Hexagons with trees earn no money, and soon your army will starve if the trees spread and it will be game over! <br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">What's good about it?<\/div>Slay still has that addictive 'just one more go' quality about it that it always had.  You won't feel like it's a job well done until you've won every map on 'master' difficulty.  Gameplay is simple: click a soldier, then click the hexagon to attack.  Soldiers can only attack unguarded hexagons or those guarded by a weaker soldier.  Each hexagon you own generates money that you can use to buy more soldiers or defense towers.  You can replay any map on any difficulty, or leave a map part played to return to it later.  Some maps present more taxing challenges than others, and there will no doubt be islands where you will be baffled by how to beat it and will resort to forums for help.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Anything not so good?<\/div>While gameplay remains unchanged from its original brilliance, this newer version (a mobile port) lacks many features that the original Slay game used to have - including multiplayer.  You can now ONLY play against the AI (which doesn't bother me that much because I'm no fan of multiplayer, but it will be a major factor for many).  The graphics have a slight blurry quality to them (again, the 1990s original sharper graphics did not) and there are no graphics settings to make the game sharper at higher resolutions, or alternatively run it windowed.  This is a shame because it makes the game feel of lesser quality than it is.  Finally, the oddly slow animations make this newer version feel sluggish, not helped by the somewhat-picky UI where clicking on soldiers in the side menu doesn't always trigger the action it's supposed to.  For features and aesthetics, I find myself in the odd position of actually preferring the original, snappier versions from the 1990s\/2000s (I still have my copy - alas, it seems it can no longer be obtained).  Gameplay however, is as rewarding and addictive as it ever was.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Should you buy it?<\/div>For the gameplay alone, absolutely - if you like board and strategy games.  It's one of those smaller and lighter games you'll probably play when you don't feel like playing your bigger AAA titles, until you realise you're playing this instead of those other games!  Just look past the limited options and the not-so-sharp graphics if you can because the gameplay is stellar - it always was and still remains one of the oldest and best lightweight strategy games on PC.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30898606', 'summary' );

For the full length review, as well as more board and video game reviews, please check out the website at the bottom of this review or in my name.<br><br>Pros<br>--------------------<br>Slay offers complex descion making even though it is very light on rules.<br>Can totally play as Penguins &amp; Pirates, which also converts your Castles to Igloos and Pirate Ships! Yaaar!<br>Undo\/Undo All and Redo\/Redo All buttons are Sean O Connors godly gift to gaming!<br><br>Cons<br>----------------------<br>No music at all!<br>No online or multiplayer<br>Seriously, this game is BASIC in a lot of ways.<br><br>The Lonely Punk - This is going to sound super silly, but one of the biggest things that contributed to me enjoying Slay was that Undo All and Redo All button. It really did just make it so incredibly easy to learn every little aspect of the game. Even as I became more adept at Slays inner workings, I found myself using the Undo All button just for all-around usefulness. It transformed Slay into a game where I had much more of a mind-set of a General or a King. It was easier to look past the games 80\u2019s looking graphics and the lack of audio, when thinking of Slay as my bare-bones map my subordinates had given me to command on a battle\u2019s current situation. Slay may be a very stripped down game in a lot of ways, from the lack of music to the bootytastic retro visuals we spoke of. But when I was looking over my Kingdom and figuring out how to command my troops, best use my resources and tie together separated parts of my Kingdom, well, I had so much to chew on that I was not THINKING about the graphics or the lack of music. I won\u2019t deny that a cleaner and prettier experience would have brought my enjoyment up of the game. I can visualize a more modern and thematic experience in my head and I\u2019m drooling over that version of Slay! But Slay, as it is, is good enough to recommend. Though I would still recommend buying it either sale or buying the IOS\/Android\/Kindle version instead, as they are cheaper AND portable experiences.<br><br>Princess - My dear husband is correct. In many ways, I felt like a Queen overlooking a battle. My Generals and various Advisors had worked together to form a map for me to stand over and strategize. However, I was a Queen frustrated enough to make heads roll! My advisors do not always have all the information I want and worse, where the bloody hell is my court bard and why isn\u2019t he soothing my nerves with calming melodies or a quick dirty limerick?!? And that is Slay in a nut shell. It is a game that is impossible to deny its quality for the simplicity of many of its mechanics and its core game play. However, its wrapped up in a very frustrating package that is missing bells and whistles leaving some more casual strategy gamers like myself overwhelmed. I can recommend the game to those who read the introduction and think it sounds fun, but only at deep discount. The IOS version is $4 as an everyday price and frankly, Slays gameplay will shine best as a portable experience anyways. I personally would still prefer games like Small World 2 or Summoner Wars to scratch my strategy itch, but Slay is likely next in line after them...especially given I can play as Penguins and Pirates! Yaaaaaar (HAH!
