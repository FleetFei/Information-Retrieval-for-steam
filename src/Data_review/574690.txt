While Mr. Triangle's Adventure begins as what looks like a juvenile game about beating up evil vegetables, by the end there's a much more serious plot that actually justifies and explains a lot of the elements that seem goofy on the surface.<br><br>Just as the game seemed to get better as it went along plotwise, with plot threads and characters growing increasingly complex and intruiging, so it did artwise. Although the first few areas are not exactly much to look at, the first dungeon in the game is simply a large corn maze with few landmarks, the further you get into the game the more diverse and well-designed the towns and dungeons become. The first town you find might just be a plain, pleasant little grassy town inhabited by fungi who live in giant toadstools, later on there's a magnificent city in the sky, a lost city in the depths of the ocean and a city straight out of the future to explore at your leisure. The dungeons get similarly more interesting, going from wheat fields and caves to cyberspace, bizarre realms and whatever the final area is supposed to be.<br><br>Even the music only gets better as the game keeps going. The first volume of the OST is already solid, but the second volume is definitely my favourite! The game really expands its scope in many ways as it keeps going on, and the music does a great job of keeping up, strongly adding to the scenes. I urge people to play the game with the music on since it's definitely tailor-made for this game.<br><br>The one part of the game that feels like it's on a solidly even level all throughout the game is its core gameplay. As you keep playing the game keeps throwing interesting new enemies and bosses at you, as well as a ton of optional content and sidequests to do! This is definitely a game you'd want to 100% as the sidequests give some truly great items for their completion, some of which are in fact so good that they make the final stretch of the game seem like one of the easier parts, which considering the difficulty of some of these sidequests is a suitable reward. That said, it does feel like the player gets access to a variety of equipment that raises HP after a certain point which makes the survivability of the game in general less of an issue which was a shame.<br><br>All-in-all Mr. Triangle's Adventure was a really enjoyable experience and it certainly was worth checking out! I have beaten the free version from RTG before, and this Steam version promises to add new content and refine the existing content, and that for the very affordable price of one euro\/dollar. <br><br>There's just so much heart and spirit to this game, and I love the way how it's just so stuffed with content and how it doesn't just take the lazy route where it would have been so easy to. There's a ton of unique sprites for all the townsfolk, there's interesting minigames, there's even a dungeon with a whole separate artstyle and retro music! The game could have omitted most of these features and it'd still be a complete game, but then it'd not be the Mr. Triangle's Adventure I grew to love! I would honestly recommend this game to anyone who is into RPGs like Final Fantasy or just anyone looking for a fun game in general, it's definitely an accessible game and I really hope people will see it for that rather than judge it for daring to be goofy!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29625918', 'summary' );
