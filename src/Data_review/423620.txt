I will add a TL;DR at the end<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay    <\/div><br>Hero Defense is not an average tower defense game because instead of building towers in a set area for them to just stand and fire at approaching enemies you get 5 mobile towers\/heroes to use. Each one of these heroes has a speciality, skill tree, and weapon rune slots to increase their power when defending. The fact you control where your heroes move and have to tactically place and manage them to successfully fend off wave after wave of enemies helps add to how much fun the game can be. Within maps you also have the option to use and build shrines which can boost specific stats, characters, or simply give you a nice boost. <br><br>The story is actually pretty stale, nothing new, nothing surprising. More like a large clich\u00e9 but that isn\u2019t really harmful to the game as a whole.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Graphics\/Sounds<\/div><br>The graphics can be unappealing to some, but overall it\u2019s a more dark 3D transilvania look which matches the game pretty nicely. The artwork and design of certain characters helps to match that theme and help add an appeal to the game.<br><br>The music is overall ok, but some of the character voices are simply horrible. The main character Jack along with some of the other heroes make me simply wish I could mute them specifically for the entire game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Pros\/Cons<\/div><br><b> Pros<\/b><br><br>+ Mobile towers\/heroes<br>+ Variation between heroes with strength and weaknesses <br>+ Unlockable runes to boost heroes<br>+ Skill trees<br>+ Enjoyable levels and variation<br>+ Requires tactical placement and preparation beforehand on heroes to beat later levels (require you to use your head)<br><br><b> Cons    <\/b><br><br>**Note since this is an Early Access title Cons and other parts of the review as well are viable to change as the game continues to develop**<br>- Stale story<br>- Grind to get runes and gold to be able to advance (this does not apply to everyone as I know some people like a good grind)<br>- Some of the character voices are horrid<br>- Graphics unappealing to some<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Suggestions<\/div><br>Suggestions I feel would help the game<br><br>- More enemy variations<br>- Preset targeting for heroes (First, Last, Strongest, Weakest) because more than once my heroes ignored the guys at the front and ended up costing me the mission (and hard to remote target if it\u2019s a giant horde and constantly click so they attack front)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Final Thoughts<\/div><br>A fun tower defense game for sure, love the micromanagement and the rune system. Skill trees are a nice touch along with reconstructing the town for different uses. I did not like the story, it was very predictable following clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 in its plot. As a tower defense game I love the system of having movable towers since it really is a pleasure to have to use an extra bit of thought to properly position your heroes. Even having to decide if you need to build a shrine or move a certain hero somewhere to be more effective and trying to match runes to help the character be better in different scenarios really made the game more enjoyable.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"> TL;DR<\/div><br>Hero Defense - Haunted Island is a game for its gameplay with different shrines, runes, skill trees, and 5 different heroes to manage and defend against the undead with. A pleasure to see within the TD genre for its type of structure and overall offering a good amount of playtime potential if you like the game and its style.<br><br><b>**<u> Key was provided by developer for review purposes <\/u>**<\/b> <br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22053822', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22053822' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22053822\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22053822' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22053822\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22053822', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22053822_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22053822_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22032805\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ladyoberon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"185605991\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/56709ee1d12e23cd3fc1357271555594418a2bbd.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/56709ee1d12e23cd3fc1357271555594418a2bbd.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/56\/56709ee1d12e23cd3fc1357271555594418a2bbd_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ladyoberon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"185605991\">LadyOberon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ladyoberon\/games\/?tab=all\">5,887 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ladyoberon\/recommended\/\">52 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ladyoberon\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used HERO DEFENSE on May 25, 2016, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHero Defense - Haunted Island is the tower defense game for gamers who aren't fans of tower defense games. I'm one such gamer, and that's precisely why my positive experience packs such a wicked punch.<br><br>Coming into the game, you're hit with striking characters and a fantastical world where supernatural creatures exist, and hunters are waiting in the wings to defeat them.<br><br>Using strictly mouse gameplay, you'll start off with Jack the ranger. Through gameplay progression, you quickly learn that by defeating a wave of creatures on a given map, you earn gold and skillpoints that can be used to upgrade Jake's weapon and upgrade or add skills to the character to make him a more deadly opponent. You can also rebuild the &quot;town&quot; by placing various building on the map that allow you to upgrade characters and weapons, and later to exchange gold coins for gems that are used for further upgrades.<br><br>During gameplay, defeated monsters drop gold and items, such as runes that are used to advance your character, and orbs that are used to &quot;charge&quot; your character, granting one of many short-term advantages or &quot;buffs.&quot; You'll also find during the process of completing waves and upgrading Jake that other characters become unlocked and available for placement on the maps. Furthermore, you'll be able to build shrines on certain maps that grant buffs, and ven placement of one character next to another can provide an advantage. <br><br>All of the characters will advance in the same way as Jake, though they all have different skills. Barrows, the occultist, is stronger against certain opponents, and Sam Hain, the firebug, is stronger against others. The same can be said for the rest of the crew.<br><br>There's a great deal of replayability here, as each map can be repeated more than once at a higher difficulty level, and beyond that, extra challenges can be added to the maps that place your crew at a disadvantage of sorts and result in higher rewards for you. There's a lot of room for game customization here, too. No two games are likely to be the same when you factor in all the different characters, map placements, shrines, and rune combinations.<br><br>It's classified as Early Access, but I have to say that this game plays like a finished product. Graphics are exquisitely clear, and the soundtrack enhances this supernatural environment. I felt like I was playing in an interactive urban fantasy. The developers seem to be not only talented but active, so I'm looking forward to more content in the future.<br><br>This game is very well done, and it can be played both in long sessions or short intervals. The instant gratification factor is definitely present, as well. Frequent loot drops and upgrades make for a beautiful give and take experience. This is certainly not a &quot;grinder.&quot; You'll also find trading cards and challenging achievements to keep you entertained.<br><br>I favor controller gameplay, and as I stated earlier, I'm not particularly a fan of tower defense games, so I would encourage any other gamers meeting those criteria to give this game a try. If you hop on board the Haunted Island tour during the Easter event, you'll find a lot more goodies waiting for you!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22032805', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22032805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22032805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22032805' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22032805\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22032805', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22032805_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22032805_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23478932\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thugnificent\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40271528\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/91ecfa92d686f39493bbba9f15a37f6ea2b2ac56.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/91ecfa92d686f39493bbba9f15a37f6ea2b2ac56.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/91\/91ecfa92d686f39493bbba9f15a37f6ea2b2ac56_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thugnificent\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40271528\">\u0287u\u01dd\u0254\u1d09\u025f\u1d09u\u0183n\u0265\u0287<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thugnificent\/games\/?tab=all\">6,888 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thugnificent\/recommended\/\">101 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/thugnificent\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 9, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHero defense: Haunted island is a tower defense game where there are no towers. You might ask \u201chow is that even a tower defense game?\u201d, well what this game does is substitutes towers with heroes. This makes for a very interesting idea and much needed variety from the typical tower defense games. The story is Count Necrosis has betrayed his Vampire race by embracing the darkness they had been fighting all along. His son Jack has sworn to destroy his father and along the way he meets different heroes who join him on his quest.<br><br><b><u>Graphics:<\/u><\/b><br><br>The game looks very pretty with some nice effects. For a tower defense type game like this the blur and all the filters look pretty good and don\u2019t interfere with your overall view. There\u2019s V-sync option, resolution option, UI scale options which is nice in my opinion and more games should include this feature. The graphics quality presets ranges from low to ultra. I ran the game on ultra graphics with v-sync off and FPS was over 60 and never dipped below that.<br><br><b><u>Sound:<\/u><\/b><br><br>The game features fully voice acted dialogs. Each hero has their own voice over dialogs. These voice acting acknowledgements of the user commands can be turned off from the options menu, so if you get tired of hearing the heroes say the same things, you can always turn this feature off. <br>The soundtracks of the game are in my opinion are very good, especially the theme music of the game is pretty awesome. It has that creepy Halloween feeling. The other soundtracks are also very atmospheric and make the game feel much more themed.<br><br><b><u>Gameplay:<\/u><\/b><br><br>This is a hero defense game, meaning there are heroes you use instead of towers and you try to defeat waves and waves of enemies and bosses. The game features 5 heroes and all of them have their own unique abilities. Unlike tower defense games this is a much more interactive game, once the waves start you\u2019ll have to keep repositioning your heroes for best efficiency against the enemies. The hero system is pretty neat as you require certain heroes for certain types of enemy waves. For example, the vampires can be best dealt with by Jack who is a crossbow attacking hero, the Igors can be best dealt with by Jane Doe who is a melee attacker. <br><br>There are 5 heroes in the game you can use. Plenty of enemies as well including Vampires, skeletons, Igors, wolves, zombies. Each hero has their own unique weapons. Jack who is the main character and trying to kill his father Count Necrosis, his main weapon is the bow and he is most effective against the Vampires. Burrows uses holy water to damage monsters. Burrows wants revenge from the skeletons for taking away his wife, naturally he\u2019s most effective against skeletons. Sam Hain is an orphan girl whose parents were killed by zombies and he uses pumpkin bombs to deal with zombie hordes, she is most effective against the zombies. Jane Doe is a woman who was brought back to life by Dr. Amalgam who wanted her to be his bride, she has lost all her memories so she doesn\u2019t even remember her name, hence, Jane Doe. She uses her club to melee attack enemies and she is most efficient against the Igors. Last but not the least is Wylde half-blood who is a human\/werewolf hybrid. He does ranged attacks with his hatchets and can counter the wolves pretty well.<br><br>The heroes also have power-ups in-game, just like you can upgrade your towers, you can also upgrade (or \u2018charge\u2019 as the game calls it) heroes in the middle of the game. When the map starts you have 150 souls, you can purchase a hero with 100 souls. Once you start killing enemies in the first wave you\u2019ll start earning more and more souls which you can use to purchase other heroes. Once you have all the heroes you can use these souls to upgrade the heroes. The upgrades for each hero are called runes. You can equip all sorts of runes in the order you want from the forge and in-game you can use the upgrade button and the runes will become available in the same pattern as you selected before. Each additional upgrade will cost 100 more souls then the last. E.g. first upgrade will be 100 souls, second will be 200, so on and so forth.  The upgrade runes include things like certain percentage of more damage, certain percentage faster attack speed, earn more orbs\/coins etc.<br><br>The map layouts are pretty basic. You get waves coming from one part of the map to another part of the map. Some maps have 2 different places where the waves go from. The waves of enemies are displayed at the top of the screen and underneath each type of enemy wave is a color, either yellow or green. These 2 colors let you know where the waves will be coming from and which route on the map they will take, so you can adjust your heroes accordingly. <br><br>You have to rebuild and upgrade your town as you progress through the game. Building and upgrading town places will give you upgrades for your heroes. There\u2019s a forge which will let you upgrade each heroes\u2019 weapons and attach runes to them. The academy lets you spend your skill points for each hero to improve their attacks. You must upgrade the academy to newer levels to be able to level up your characters to as well. E.g. you need level 3 academy to be able to purchase the level 3 upgrades for each hero. There\u2019s also a bank which lets you exchange coins for gems. Gems can be used to purchase weapon upgrades from the forge. All the levels can be replayed over if you want to improve your gameplay. Furthermore, you can play with different difficulties as well and higher difficulty will earn you more stars. Stages in the later part of the game require you to have certain number of stars to be able to play them so you must grind your way back to the earlier levels in higher difficulties.<br><br><b><u>Annoyances\/problems:<\/u><\/b><br><br>The camera can be a bit problematic in my opinion. You can\u2019t rotate and change the angles at all. Due to this I had difficulty in keeping track of enemies on a couple of levels. On most maps it\u2019s fine but can be a pain in a few maps. <br><br>Multiplayer also seems to be dead as I could not find anyone playing online, so you might want to keep that in mind if you are planning to play this game in multiplayer mode. Though co-op mode is coming (as the developers have stated), that should make up for the multiplayer part and you can play with your friends which is always fun.<br><br>A short gameplay video can be found below:<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=700807563\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=700807563<\/a><br><br><b><u>Graphics: 8\/10<\/u><\/b><br><b><u>Sound: 9\/10<\/u><\/b><br><b><u>Gameplay: 7\/10<\/u><\/b><br><b><u>Overall: 8\/10<\/u><\/b><br><br><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b><br><br>The game is extremely fun and can be addicting. If you\u2019re a tower defense genre fan, this game is a very good game in that genre. The story is also nice with all characters brining something different in the game. The game is surprisingly well polished and I did not notice any unusual behavior, glitches or problems. At $15, I think it\u2019s very reasonable but if you think it\u2019s steep I\u2019d suggest you wait till the upcoming big sale and most likely the game will go on sale.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23478932', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23478932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23478932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23478932' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23478932\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23478932', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23478932_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23478932_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20841974\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"8283793\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a07292e31dee17345fe825380e4a1c1a0e098f46.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a07292e31dee17345fe825380e4a1c1a0e098f46.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a0\/a07292e31dee17345fe825380e4a1c1a0e098f46_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/\" data-miniprofile=\"8283793\">laurent<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/games\/?tab=all\">168 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/recommended\/\">42 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/elefantopia\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.7 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while HERO DEFENSE was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 29, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHighly addictive and polished traditional TD with mobile heroes instead of static towers.

The choice of colour, and combination of fog with a cartoon environment simply looks awesome! But you can see that from the trailer! <br><br>\u2714 <b><u>The GUI is Beautiful!<\/u><\/b><br>It\u2019s aesthetically pleasing, scales correctly, and just looks and feels great. It doesn\u2019t need any explanation, you just know what everything does, the skill menu especially!<br><br>\u2714 <b><u>The sounds are immersive!<\/u><\/b><br>Every action has a different sound, and it\u2019s very noticeable! No corners were cut with the sound design!<br><br>\u2714 <b><u>It offers a challenging experience!<\/u><\/b><br>Some games start slowly and build up the difficulty, but not in hero defence. Right away, you\u2019re thrown in the deep end, with one moment of concentration loss losing you the game. <br><br>\u2714 <b><u>A unique concept, with plenty to do!<\/u><\/b><br>It\u2019s very interesting to play a tower defence where you can move your units!<br><br>\u2714 <b><u>Simple and effective multiplayer!<\/u><\/b><br>The multiplayer definitely has potential. In short, it\u2019s an extended singleplayer. Instead of playing by yourself, your friend\u2019s singleplayer map is put next to yours so you can see how they\u2019re doing. It has to be said though, there isn\u2019t much time to watch them! It throws you into the end levels regardless of how far through the singleplayer you are.<br><br>\u2714 <b><u>You can skip the tutorial!<\/u><\/b><br>I definitely saw an option to skip it! It\u2019s such a burden when games don\u2019t offer this functionality!<br><br><br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>CONS:<\/b><\/div>\u2716  <b><u>It definitely gets repetitive.<\/u><\/b><br>You have to move your units back and forth a lot. Their range isn\u2019t enough to kill everything from one spot, so you have to shift them along. Then, move them back to the spawn so there\u2019s enough time to kill the next wave. Over and over again.<br><br>\u2716  <b><u>The controls seem unnatural.<\/u><\/b><br>To move a unit, you left click it, and then right click the location you want them to move to. It took me a while to get the hang of this. There are key binds, but no option to change mouse control, unfortunately!  <br><br>\u2716  <b><u>You can\u2019t select multiple units.<\/u><\/b><br>For the most part, you\u2019ll want to move all your units together! But you can\u2019t select multiple units, so you have to do it individually, which wastes a lot of precious time! Also, units push each other out the way to get past, but the unit that got pushed doesn\u2019t move back after.<br><br>\u2716  <b><u>The \u201cMain Menu\u201d is confusing<\/u><\/b><br>Instead of an option list, you\u2019re presented with a burning city. However it\u2019s not obvious as to what each building does. You just have to click them all until you find some gameplay! Floating text would be really helpful!<br><br>\u2716  <b><u>The storyline felt forced.<\/u><\/b><br>This isn\u2019t a game you play for the storyline, but even so. All the characters lack empathy or personality, and it all just feels slapped together. The protagonist told a guy who literally just lost his wife to a fire to \u201cmourn her later\u201d. <br><br>\u2716  <b><u>Minor issues.<\/u><\/b><br>Enemies don\u2019t move smoothly around corners, they snap quickly, which is very noticeable. The rune inventory is set. It looks like a standard inventory slot system, except you can\u2019t put stuff where you want, everything has a default place. The heroes crossbow arrows come from the hero rather than the bow. Just little details like this that need fixing!<br><br>\u2716 <b><u>One voice actor?<\/u><\/b><br>As awesome as some of the voices are, it honestly sounds like it was all recorded by one actor, using different inflections and pitch distortion software. <br><br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b>SUGGESTIONS:<\/b><\/div>\u2605 <b><u>Collaboration multiplayer!<\/u><\/b><br>I really would love to experience some more engagement between you and the other player! Maybe a mode where both you and player 2 can move all the units together. Or to prevent exploitation from strangers, maybe you take control of 3 heroes, and they take the other 2.<br><br>\u2605 <b><u>More units!<\/u><\/b><br>The joy of tower defence is that you can build more and more units! But here you\u2019ll always be stuck with the main characters. If you could rescue citizens for certain levels that you could also control, to help tackle each wave, that would definitely add some replayability!<br><br>\u2605 <b><u>Streamline the skill upgrades!<\/u><\/b><br>I enjoy doing things quickly. One major issue I had with the skill menu, is that you have to close each skill after upgrading it before selecting the next one.

I especially love games within the genre that attempt to be innovative, those that attempt to tell a story rather than just spit out increasingly more difficult levels at you and those that possess a high presentation level with a lot of charm. All three do a good job of summarizing Happy Tuesday\u2019s fantastic Steam debut in Hero Defense: Haunted Island. It\u2019s the type of game that I know that I will not be able to get enough of and will find time to play throughout my reviewing and playing of future games for Steamified. It\u2019s just that damn good. I am thoroughly enjoying to the point of loving what I have played thus far.<br><br>One of the great things about Happy Tuesday\u2019s game is that they haven\u2019t stopped working on it since launching it into the Steam Early Access program. There have already been six updates and patches to the game since it launched on January 26 (the morning of January 27 in Australia which is what date Steam provides me so if my dates are slightly off for some of you you\u2019ll understand why). They\u2019ve planned for a two month early access period so we\u2019re coming up to just under two weeks from an estimated launch date.<br><br>Without a shadow of a doubt the game\u2019s greatest strength is its customization. You can practically play the game, as the descriptor says, the way you want to play it. Of course, there will be those who are such avid players of the game that they will argue that there is one best way to play the game \u2013 maximizing all of a certain skill set combined with what they consider to be the best runes, etc. but those of us who are more willing to play the game without spending a lot of time looking at all of the statistics to prove one theory right or wrong have a lot of different avenues to play. I\u2019m not suggesting for a moment that those who do choose to maximize the game are going about it the wrong way as that can achieve a deeper level of enjoyment from the game and I\u2019m certain that Happy Tuesday are hoping that their game has such avid fans.<br><br>Another feature that I like is that you can move your heroes around the map to put them into the position that you believe is the most productive. This certainly has a massive impact on the employed strategies. If your enemies move too fast then positioning your heroes at the start of the map can be disastrous because by the time that you react it can be a case of too little too late. However, if your enemies are slow and strong positioning far from the beginning can have the opposite effect \u2013 you don\u2019t kill them before they get to the end of their path.<br><br>There are five heroes in the game. You begin with Jack Sanders who is a vampire slayer and then you unlock Barrows who is a grisly old gravedigger who has lost his poor wife. Barrows is best against skeletons. The next hero that you\u2019re introduced to is the charming Samantha \u201cSam\u201d Hain whose a precious little pumpkin thrower and zombie killer extraordinaire. The fourth hero is Jane Doe whose brain was used to create a Frankenstein\u2019s monster. The final unlockable hero is Wylde Halfblood who is half-man and half-wolf so your werewolf character which is pretty cool.<br><br>Another thing that I very much enjoyed was the fact that the next level isn\u2019t just given to you upon completion of the last. You have to meet certain criteria to unlock many of the zones in the game. What this means is that you need to unlock a certain amount of stars before advancing. You gain stars by completing levels \u2013 one star per successful level completion. For example, the first time that you complete a level you will be awarded a single star for that level. The second time you complete the level you will receive a second star and so on and so forth. This is a very good way of level and area progression.<br><br>Speaking of progression each character progresses similarly to how they would in many RPGs. As each character levels up you unlock skill points which you can utilize on a skill tree. Each hero progresses individually and has a number of different arcs that can be upgraded. Thankfully if you feel that at any time your character isn\u2019t performing the best that you think it can you are able to reclaim skill points and redistribute them into the skills that you believe will perform better. As I said previously the customization within the game is incredible.<br><br>From a technical perspective I really cannot fault the presentation. The graphics are perfect to capture the feel and aesthetic of the game that the developers had in mind for the game. They allow you the freedom that you desire to navigate throughout each map and add just the right amount of character to the game. The soundtrack and the sound are spotless as well. They aide the game to establish the mood and the ambiance that you would imagine from a horror themed tower defense game. It\u2019s simply a superb game no matter which way you look at it.<br><br>Finally, there is an online multiplayer component to be added to the game which I am very much looking forward to. If anyone would like to play together then I am very much welcome to your invitation. There will be unique runes available to be won through the multiplayer mode. The multiplayer was not available at time of review but from the descriptor, below, it appears that it will be a combination of MOBA and tower defense. My only hope is that the game comes without latency issues as coming from Australia some online multiplayer games are impossible to play because of it.<br><br>My hope for this game is that when it is feature complete and released out of Early Access that the critics do not ignore the game. It deserves to have its time in the spotlight and I believe that many critics will be pleasantly surprised by how well-developed and polished this game actually is.<br><br>An easy recommendation to practically everyone. There is so much for everyone who likes playing video games to enjoy here even if you\u2019re not traditionally a fan of tower defense games.<br><br>For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >http:\/\/www.steamified.com\/<\/a><br><br>To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Steamified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Steam Group<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21878248', 'summary' );

are one of several hero characters which have a full RPG style item system and skill tree that allow you to customize and level the characters up in the way that you want them to.  This allows for you to consider how each hero works with the others to give you a synergy in killing the attacking army because oh no! while you can hurt the enemy with all of the hero types, each hero has a specific type of enemy that they really excel at defeating and this can be seen by their colour coding for each wave meaning you need to plan ahead to make sure your hero is in the right place.  Thats right because this is where you again depart from the old tower defence format as your Hero characters are mobile around the map and can stand in many different places allowing you to take advantage of well placed shrines to boost your attack speed, range, or damage output.  But again watch out, only certain heroes can use some of these to your advantage.<br><br>Over all this is a very fun game, a little easy on the lowest difficulties needed to progress the story but you can go back and re-do a map to gain more rewards and give you an extra challenge as you level up your Hero.<br><br>All in all I recommend this game and I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20934139', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20934139' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20934139\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20934139' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20934139\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20934139', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20934139_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20934139_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary23526477\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"51982778\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/1d\/1db11939f3c0adeae786b83c541b6d5c4c4d03f9_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/\" data-miniprofile=\"51982778\">Nerney9<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/games\/?tab=all\">6,889 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/recommended\/\">29 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Nerney9\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">14.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: June 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Short Version:<\/b>  Tower Defense game that's got it all... Action! Adventure! Skill-progression! Horror! Drama! Suspense! Ridiculously on-the-nose names like Necrosis the vampire and Wylde the werewolf!  And most importantly... innovative gameplay that <b>doesn't<\/b> feel like just another reskin of the same old TD app we've all played a million times!  Huzzah!<br><br>Hero Defense - Haunted Island is a tower defense game with a generous dollop of action and RPG-style progression stirred into the mix.  The main twist of the game is that instead of building static towers to stop the usual waves of enemies, you must instead coordinate your party of heroes to defend various routes, moving them around the map to defend the cowardly townsfolk from monstrous baddies.  <br><br>The unique action-based defense system is very well done and surprisingly challenging.  Each of your five heroes effectively acts as an incredibly mobile tower (you can move them around the map at different speeds), and each has their own special means of attack as well as strengths and weaknesses against certain enemy types. Additionally, you are free to develop these five hero-towers as you like, choosing which skills and weapon upgrades your heroes will have access to during the map.  This means you must not only coordinate your party's movement and placement during battle, but also gear up with an appropriate combination of upgrades before each scenario to make sure your heroes stand a fighting chance.<br><br>The campaign mode is nicely polished, with a story that is a bit on the light and silly side, but is *much* meatier than tower defense games usually offer.  As you progress through the story and unlock various maps, you also unlock harder difficulties and map-specific challenges that will take much more skill (as well as grindable upgrades) to beat.  This adds a great deal of extra replayability to the game.<br><br>Hero Defense also offers another potentially exciting feature: multiplayer.  Right now, this is a competitive mode, where doing well on your own map gives you powers to try and trip up your opponent.  You compete with other players in weeklong multiplayer seasons, developing your party of heroes as you choose according to the specific rules and restrictions for that'season', then trying to reach the top of the ladder ranks before the season is up.  <br><br>As Hero Defense is relatively new (released just a couple of weeks ago), currently there are not many players searching for multiplayer matches - however this may change as the playerbase grows.  The developers also seem to be making every effort to encourage and support multiplayer, and have been very active in the community in order to do so.  In addition to encouraging competition with ladder rankings for weekly multiplayer seasons, they have even hosted a tournament with gamekeys as a reward for the top finishers.  I would not expect this kind of event to be a usual thing, but it certainly shows their dedication to making the social portion of the game a success. The developers have also confirmed that they are working on a cooperative mode for release in the near future, so I have high hopes for the multiplayer side of the game - even if it's not quite there yet.<br><br>All in all, Hero Defense - Haunted Island is the kind of game that just makes me happy to play it.  The game offers a reasonable amount of challenge, a quirkily entertaining story, plenty of replayability, and a progression system that is simple enough to understand, but offers enough complexity to make choices extremely relevant, especially in the tough (but optional) challenge maps.  Plus, everything is layered with a nice coat of polish, from the pleasant graphics to the in-game voiceovers.  With all these checks in the positive column, Hero Defense is a refreshing style of tower defense game that even people who don't usually love the genre can enjoy.<br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">Received a free copy for testing\/reviewing purposes.

Instead of building and managing towers, you\u2019ll actually be controlling a small roster of heroes, as you make your way through a series of levels on a haunted island chasing the Count, the father of one of your heroes. The game features an overall nice collection of music tracks and, in terms of visuals the game looks pretty good, and it reminds me of Dota 2 to some extent.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay overview<\/div><br>In a genre filled with tons of clones and some games that are barely worth playing, where Hero Defense distinguishes itself from others in the genre is in the fact that your \u201ctowers\u201d are mobile, or more they are heroes. Given the fact that there is are only 5 heroes for you to choose, this also means there is not much to choose from. Since each wave usually features a specific type of enemy, each one of these types of enemies has a specific counter hero that will be better in dealing with said enemy type. However, enemies move rather quickly along their path, and there are multiple entry points to the level, as well as different paths that they can take, which ends up forcing you to keep your heroes constantly on the move so they can keep up with the enemy waves. This might seem like somewhat of a hassle at first, especially if you\u2019re used to playing traditional Tower Defense games but after a while you quickly get the hang of it. Also, instead of having towers, what you have are what the game calls shrines, which are basically various spots on the maps that, if you put a hero there, those shrines will grant them a buff, like increased range or double damage.<br><br>In the same way, as you might be used to upgrading towers in other games, here you\u2019ll be leveling up your heroes by spending orbs, which are dropped by the enemies you kill. Each of these level ups will grant a specific bonus to that character, which you can change if you see fit in the \u201cTown\u201d. The Town represents the structure for permanent progression and is something I quite enjoy. As you play the various levels you\u2019ll gain gold, you can then spend this gold to restore the town which was destroyind by the vampire count. You can upgrade your Academy, granting you more skill options for each character, the Forge, which will allow you to upgrade your character weapons more and more as well as change their runes (the bonus effect you receive upon leveling them up mid-game) and last but by no means least, you also have the Vault\/Bank, which you can use to exchange gold for gems (gems can be used to level up your heroes weapons, for example). This progression element made \u201cfarming\u201d on previous levels a lot more enjoyable because I knew I was actually going to get something from it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Mixed feelings<\/div><br>One of the things I can\u2019t really decide how I feel about it is the story. While I don\u2019t think that the one in this game is terrible, I found it to be rather cliche, and while the characters themselves are distinct from each other, I feel like they don\u2019t have that much of a character. It just felt like they\u2019re there for the unrolling and for gameplay purposes.<br><br>One huge annoyance I do have with Hero Defense is the fact that even though I found the controls to be intuitive, I think there should be an option to move multiple units at the same time, without having the need to order them one by one to go to the same spot, because sometimes, when there are a lot of enemies coming at you, you\u2019ll have to keep moving your heroes from one place to the other while trying to get them in the best posssible spot. Also, it would be nice to have some actual control over the camera, having the ability to rotate it would be pretty nice and would help in some cases.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><b><u>Final verdict<\/u><\/b><\/div><br><b>Overall, despite a different approach on an already popular and diversified genre, I think that Hero Defense manages to present some new ideas that make it worth playing. Still, like any other game it can get quite repetitive, especially if you play it through long periods of time. It does also have a co-op and PvP mode which I\u2019ve been unable to try.<br><br>With that in mind, if the idea of having a small selection of units, each countering a specific enemy, pleases you, or if you\u2019re really into permanent progression like myself, I think there is plenty to enjoy on Hero Defense - Haunted Island. The spooky\/halloween theme fits it perfectly and there are plenty of hours of fun to be had if you\u2019re a fan of the genre.<\/b><br><br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

You won't find it here since I still didn't have the chance to play them (and I'm not keen on the idea of playing PvP anyway).<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Tower Defense or Hero Defense?<\/b><\/u><\/div>Call it whatever you want, but having control over your towers\/heroes is nice and refreshing, I know people that never got into tower defense genre as - in their own words - &quot;you just click and watch&quot; (although personally that is one of the reasons I like it). <br><br>Hero Defense has only five heroes, but they are unique on their own way and each one has defining traits and weak points which you'll have to work with in order to win.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Hero Management:<\/b><\/u><\/div>The controls are simple enough: 1 to 5 selects the hero, left-click moves them and Space will level them up if you have enough orbs. The game keeps it clean and simple as it should be.<br><br>Of course if these controls are not to your liking you can reassign them.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Town to rebuild, bonuses to get<\/b><\/u><\/div>Everything starts simple enough: pay gold (gems for one building) and get a permanent bonus. <br><br>But as you may already be thinking: Grinding? Yes. Read below.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Grinding<\/b><\/u><\/div>This is what could be the ugly part for me. Grinding is a VERY delicate balance that either makes a game good and tolerable or downright insufferable. And I personally can be very much fickle about this as well.<br><br>Hero Defense does it\u2026 Mildly right. While the beginning will certainly be bumpy and hard, the game has a nice, and may I add cathartic, surprise later on that will tell the difficulty of grinding to go suck a big one. But it's there merely to help you as town and weapon upgrades will get ridiculously expensive.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Skill trees<\/b><\/u><\/div>Every hero has its skill tree which will define their own style. Most of them are clear cut on what the hero does: focus on a single target, deals with crowds and so on.<br><br>For those who played games which give you tons of skills and makes you pull your hair just thinking what to do, what skills to leave behind, Hero Defense allows you to have all skills at once. <br><br>However you'll have to grind and level up your heroes accordingly. Some will love this, others will not. This left a mixed taste in my mouth; as in initially sweet but sour aftertaste. Why? While I do love having everything, it takes away some potential unique builds that would give characters even more distinction.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Heroes and runes<\/b><\/u><\/div>There's the usual tower defense: you get resources to start, put a hero, kill enemies, get money, level up your heroes, put another hero... Nothing out of the usual.<br><br>What makes it unique then? <br>Runes does.<br><br>Runes are how you make each hero unique on their own even with their skill tress. You can give runes to turn a mild damaging hero into something powerful, or give an attack speed rune to that slow attacking hero and watch them fill the screen with attacks.<br><br>Runes are scaled as this: Common - Uncommon - Rare - Epic. As you can imagine Epic runes will take the longest to get as they are fairly expensive, but at least you are granted to get one, but you'll still need to luck out to get the one you want (power up, speed up, extra projectile chance\u2026).<br><br>The game has a simple craft system defined as &quot;Merge&quot; which allows you swap lower rarity runes into better quality ones. Use all of the same type and it'll ensure you a better rarity rune of that type. If you don't, you'll need luck as the result will be random.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Complaints and suggestions<\/b><\/u><\/div>Hero Defense may not receive a ton of awards, but it sure does try hard and the efforts of the team behind it clearly show. But the game, like 100% of everything out there, has its share of problems.<br><br>1) The loading time to use the Town is unacceptable. It is far too long and wears down on the player really fast.<br><br>2) Hero AI can be random or downright stupid at times. They tend to focus on enemies in the middle instead of the last in the group. While manual targeting DOES help, options of automatic targeting (most health, etc.) would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>3) Shrines costs gem. No problem. Shrines are permanent until you build something on them. No problem. Shrine cost increases with each one you build. No problem. The game doesn't keep track where you built shrines. <b><i><u>THAT'S a problem.<\/u><\/i><\/b><br><br>4) This is a very little something but bugs me to no end: whenever you finish a map with a victory there's no Restart button. Sounds like nitpicking, but this is a game about farming to a certain degree and having to go back to the World Map to choose the map you want again gets tiresome.<br><br>5.1) The game has only five types of enemies and while they try to be distinct from each other they always feel &quot;samey&quot; when you reach higher levels. Since every enemy can have about every ability (with some exceptions), the only thing you'll end worrying about in most cases is which hero should fight which enemy.<br><br>5.2) Enemy abilities feel uninspired as they only affect themselves, enemies will never actively hamper your heroes' progress. Enemies could have other things like swapping heroes' position, swapping one hero for another, blocking one hero, reducing their range or attack speed, punishing players for clustering heroes too much or leaving them too far from each other\u2026<br><br>6.1) Another complaint is the lack of runes that can give unique effects like Poisoning enemies, slowing them and similar effects to somewhat emulate other characters.<br><br>6.2) Lack of variety in weapons. While rune slot upgrades are good it'd give much more character definition having equipable weapons that increases their attack rate, attack strength or range.<br><br>7) And this feels more like nitpicking from me, but the game gets <i><b>too easy once<\/b><\/i> you get everything; town upgrades, powerful Epic runes, and weapons maxed. While it does feel immensely good crush Insane difficulty levels that were getting under your skin, that also loses its charm fast. And no, Endless is not a solution for this, Survival Mode in tower defenses never felt accomplishing or anything since, you know, they don't have end. Maybe a fifth difficulty could solve this.<br><br>8) Camera control. You don't have free control of your camera and more often than not you can end up having an obstacle obstructing your view which may cause anything from an annoyance to costing you the entire map.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><u><b>Final words<\/b><\/u><\/div>Hero Defense - Haunted Island is a hidden gem that is still being polished by Happy Tuesday even after taking off its Early Access status, but it's far from being bad, broken or unplayable. As I've just noted, this game has its issues, feels like it still has a lot of potential, but it's very well worth playing.<br><br>In the end its lack of diversity of enemies, runes and weapons can make the game feel repetitive for some people, but Hero Defense - Haunted Island was charming enough to keep me captive for good 55 hours (as of this writing). And that's not counting the co-op mode which I haven't tested yet.<br><br>Knowing Happy Tuesday is still working and releasing patches on *drums rolls* Tuesdays to address known issues and seeing that they at least care enough to ask and answer people in their Community Hub is another good thing I want to point. If you have the chance, give Hero Defense a try.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24735886', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24735886' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24735886\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24735886' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24735886\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24735886', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24735886_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24735886_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30472432\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197967685936\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"7420208\">^7ja^1co<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 14.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a pleasnt surprise this game is!

Out of the 12 hours I spent, a good portion of that was grinding for better items, level ups and upgrades only to breeze my way through the second half of the game, including the final &quot;boss&quot; level.<br><br>Again, it's well made; this is not one of those cheap asset flips or poor ports. I found it ran just fine. It got challenging at the higher difficulty levels, but only in that you need to grind for better items; if you're having trouble with a certain level or challenge, it's probably not your strategy that's the problem. As far as TD goes, I give this one a 7\/10 and mainly because of the inovation (this squad-based strategy isn't for every TD fan though).

I am rescinding the bit about the microtransactions, because of this I would highly recommend the game, because aside from the gems aspect, everything else (While maybe being a tad unbalanced and encountering some quirks with the turorial) the game wasn't bad and I could see myself enjoying this. To add to this, there are no microtransactions in this game whatsoever, but perhaps gems wasn't the best choice.<br><br>_______________________________<br><br>I didn't have much of a chance to play the game, and for me that's unfortunate because it did truly look promising. I don't often enjoy requesting refunds for games, because I really try to find reasons to stick around and like them. If you'll take the time to read my review, you may come to understand my grievances and make a decision for yourself on whether or not you will purchase this game.<br><br>_______________________________<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Here's a few things I liked about the game: (Pros)<\/div><br>_______________________________<br><br><b>-Simple Graphics<\/b><br>I think visually, this game is pretty appealing. It's one of the things that drew me into it. I think the designers did a pretty bang up job on the overall aesthetic<br><br><b>-Simple UI\/Easy to use<\/b><br>I really liked how simple everything was laid out for the most part, I've seen some prenty clunky UI's before and I think this is one of the most simple ones I've used, and visually it's really appealing too.<br><br><b>-Cool Building\/Upgrades System<\/b><br>The two buildings I found and got the opportunity to use were the Academy and the Weapons upgrade building, the Academy offered a talents based system which was pretty cool and I liked some of the talents offered, the weapons building allowed you to upgrade and augment weapons<br><br><b>-Easy Tutorial<\/b><br>Aside from the hiccups which I will list in the Cons section, the tutorial was pretty easy and gave me a pretty good idea of what I was doing<br><br><b>-Cool Maps<\/b><br>The maps were pretty well done, I liked the overall aesthetic from choosing a map to play on to actually going into the game and playing on the map itself<br><br>_______________________________<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">And here's the many things I didn't like: (Cons)<\/div><br>_______________________________<br><br>Unfortunately while I wanted to give this game a chance, for the $15.00 price tag it genuinely wasn't worth it to me. I've played plenty of other games around the same price and received significantly more content, that is much more polished. Perhaps it's unethical to compare other games with this, but I feel like it's reasonable to do that; <b>when you pay $15.00 and get a really good game that you like, you come to expect something of the same or really similar quality for that price.<\/b> Here's WHY I don't recommend you buy this game.<br><br><b>-The Tutorial<\/b><br>I know I said the tutorial above was simple, which it was, I have a complaint. While the tutorial was explaining what to do, the monsters in the game continued to move, this really annoyed me because I ended up losing that round because I was trying to read and understand what I was doing, I don't know why but it really rubbed me the wrong way. The other thing that really bothered me was the dialogue popups for the tutorial. They literally come up right in the middle of the screen and they overlap buttons, creatures, everything. I feel like the placement is really invasive, and even after I thought I completed the tutorial, the game was still 'barking orders' and holding my hand through a couple missions. It really bothered me, I just wanted to play at that point but I had to deal with random popups<br><br><b>-Talents<\/b><br>While the talents that were available were kinda cool, there was like 8 of them per character. I was really concerned with this because I knew that once I max out those talents there's not really much more progression beyond that aside from augmenting and improving my weapons, which might be enough for some people, but I really look for more of that end game content early on because for me it's something to set goals for, and I didn't feel like I could keep myself hooked on talents and weapon upgrades alone<br><br><b>-Poor Balancing<\/b><br>To be honest, the initial maps while being very visually appealing, are extremely short in length, I'm sure they get longer as you progress through the game; however because of the short length, the poor balancing became extremely noticeable. Even after completing the tutorial the next 1 or 2 missions right after that were relatively difficult (Was forced to use 'freeze' powerups) and I almost lost some lives because of some enemies being too powerful. I understand how the game works with some heroes being stronger to certain enemy types, and I assure you with the utmost confidence that I do\/did understand how the mechanics worked and that it wasn't a personal struggle causing me to have difficulty killing creatures. The poor balancing was obvious<br><br><b>-The deal breaker, Microtransactions<\/b><br>This was what did it for me, I really wanted to give this game a chance, I thought maybe, you know for $15.00 I could live with minimal talents, having some weapons upgrades, etc. everything else wasn't a huge concern. But upon entering into the game in the top right corner I noticed the little Gem icon, and a little 'uh oh' went off in my head.<b> I thought to myself &quot;Joe, don't freak out just yet, it's all gonne be okay, maybe they allow people to buy gems just for cosmetics.&quot;, unfortunately that was a lie.<\/b> Upon entering the weapons shop, I discovered, to my dismay, that they allowed people to purchase what appeared to be 'legendary' (Orange) weapons augments for 500 Gems\/Diamonds, and also in order to upgrade your weapon with diamonds. Being that this game offers Co-Op, PVP, and Ranked matches, I figure this will give players an unreasonably fair advantage over other players that do not intend to purchase Gems\/Diamonds.<br><br><b>If you can really support a developer that makes you purchase a game for $15.00 and then hits you with a 'paywall' (Essentially forcing you to purchase gems to enhance your character to a point where you can further progress in the game), by all means purchase this game<\/b>; everything but the microtransactions wasn't too awful, and I could see why some people may like this game. However I do feel that the game was poorly balanced to give players more incentive to purchase diamonds to augment and enhance their character. <br><br>Personally, I cannot support a developer that charges $15.00 for a game that allows you to purchase and upgrade\/enhance your equipment with gems. I totally wouldn't care or even make a big deal about it if it were cosmetics, but we are talking about the potential for giving one player an advantage over another. If I spent $100.00 in gems, it wouldn't be fair to Billy Joe Bob from Arkansas who didn't buy any gems at all. I've come to expect gear enhancing microtransactions from free games, or even cosmetic microtransactions from purchased games; however when a game that you purchased supports gear enhancing microtransactions. I cannot, and will not stand behind it or it's developers.<br><br>I'm not some guy who doesn't support developers at all, I understand there are costs for server maintenance, etc. But there are BETTER types of microtransactions to add to your game to generate revenue, but to allow players to gain an advantage over one another based upon who has the bigger pocketbook, in my eyes, extremely unethical; to be honest I'm a tad shocked that nobody else who has reviewed the product has taken issue with this.<br><br><br><br>_______________________________<br><br><br>I hope that for many of you that may read this, this will allow you to make an educated decision on whether or not you intend to purchase the game. Whether or not you get it it is up to you, but as stated initially in this review, I personally wouldn't recommend this game to ANYONE for the reasons listed above.<br><br>_______________________________\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29265102', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29265102' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29265102\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29265102' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29265102\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29265102', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29265102_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29265102_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29072436\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198069777724\/recommended\/423620\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"109511996\">Hogga, doesn't speak Russian<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 55.3 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNew fresh idea on Tower defense category.
