I feel I must in this case and come to Carenados defence with these negative reviews. As an avid flightsimmer over the past 7 years and owning no less than 17 Carenado products, make that 18 now. I have a pretty robust idea of what Carenados products are like and I can say this is no less than a pretty descent product at $13.99 on sale. For those who don't know, Carenado is a payware aircraft company that produces general aviation products for flightsimulator and have recently stepped up into small jet aircraft like the Cessna Citation as well as small helicopters like the R66 Turbine. Carenado through the years has gotten fantastic at what they do, and make incredibly detailed aircraft now-a-days. This Piper PA-28-RT-201 Arrow IV has been on the market since at least 2009 from what I can tell based on reviews. <br><br>So here's the skinny on the Carenado Piper 201 Arrow....<br><br>-Flawless flight dynamics (behaves very well in the air and on the ground while taxing).<br>-The model, while not the most incredibly detailed aircraft compared to their newest products, (bearing in mind that this was early on in fsx history) is still leaps and bounds beyond default fsx aircraft.<br>-All the sensors work great, stall warnings, flap warnings, gear warnings all work like a real ga aircraft.<br>-The dash is a bit dated (again bearing in mind it is early fsx), but still looks great and is detailed very well.<br>-The buttons while clicking with a mouse are a bit off but if u click on the actual dial it pulls up that dial and the nobs turn bang on. (Remembering that these models are more designed to work with professional radio stacks and flight yokes than mouse clicking).<br>-Yes this model does not have a 2d panel, but it is on the disclaimer on the website and to be honest most Carenado products don't, they are designed to be flown in cockpit for real GA enthusiast not for kids messing around. Carenados products require you to learn how to fly their products and are not intended to be casually flown, although once you learn to fly them you can casually fly around.<br>-The sound files associated with this aircraft are superb as well.<br>-Not every button on the radio stack is clickable but if you have a saitek radio stack or flight yoke it will work just fine.<br>-The price for Carenado products range from about $19.00 to $40.00 and while I agree that being an older aircraft that the price is a bit steep without being on sale it is in line (actually average is $27.99), with the rest of their products.<br><br>As for the comment about the scenery and other aircraft from previous reviews on here, remember this while flying about in FSX. This game is more than just a game, it's a hobby for alot of people and hobbies cost money. Some of FSX products can be quite steep in cost but when you pay for those products you are getting something that is as close to the real thing as possible (aircraft wise). It is quite complex to make a plane model fly, act, and behave like the real thing, modeling is quite complex therefore the price is steep in some cases when it all works right. As for the scenery? Even that is getting quite good and expensive as well.<br><br>To conclude, it is a bit over priced for an older aircraft but I am sure it was a test bed for Carenado as this is their first venture on steam. Their newer products are absolutley fantastic and incredibly detailed and worth every penny. I look forward to many more of the payware companies to bring forth their products as it makes it much easier with the direct install to steam. I have also had no errors or issues with this aircraft for those who want to know.<br><br>Happy flying!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15135169', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '15135169' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary15135169\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '15135169' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary15135169\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '15135169', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15135169_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary15135169_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15146530\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982842816\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"22577088\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fe\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982842816\/\" data-miniprofile=\"22577088\">maxpower2k<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982842816\/games\/?tab=all\">38 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982842816\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197982842816\/recommended\/353620\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 31, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNice plane and you know it works with Steam.
