The mechanics are rather simple, as a disembodied soul you float around different areas and look for places that trigger memories that help you experience the life of the protagonist, Rick.  The plot is fairly simple and does not take too many twists and turns, although I don't think that was the intention.  This type of storytelling is more about finding intrigue and interest in the mundane.  It would be the same experience as going through the personal items of a long deceased relative and piecing together the type of person they were.<br><br>If you ever played the game Sarena, this game is very similar and has about the same design and mechaincs with more locations.  The graphics on the first couple of levels are beautiful and match the mood of the story.  The later levels could use a little more polish.  The layout of the areas make logical sense, but you are quite aware you are playing a computer game and that fact breaks the immersion into the story. <br><br>Although it is simple I think the developers are on to a type of storytelling that would work vary well in VR.  Having large environments that allow a story to be told as you progress through them.  It apprears this is a new venture for Green Sawdust, but I am curious to see if they will continue producing similar titles.  Although the subject matter is rather dark, it is presented in a comforting way.  I could see that this game may be able to help those recently suffeing loss help find some peace sharing how the characters are adapting to their in-game loss.<br><br>Final verdict:   If you like the occasional break from action, explosions, and gore to just sit back and have a storytelling experience this is worth a playthrough.  It will give you a moments pause to refelct some deeper aspects of life and death.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('27636829', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '27636829' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary27636829\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '27636829' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary27636829\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '27636829', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27636829_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary27636829_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29497970\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"202025019\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/81\/812010fbbcd539f8820e52c31eb3a046996d0049_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/\" data-miniprofile=\"202025019\">Tawny Lawns \ud83d\udc97<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/games\/?tab=all\">3,494 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/recommended\/\">22 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/recommended\/550240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Recalling Thoughts...<\/div>Despite having a comically named high quality graphics setting option upon launch penned, &quot;<i>I have a Titan. Bring it<\/i>&quot;, X-D (did cause the beast I was using minor stutter) the title of this game is literal and serious. After Life is tear-jerking.<br><br>Sappy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 <i>(and I use that term lovingly)<\/i> pull at my heartstrings until even my soul is numb from all the weeping so I am far from new to it. Of the many mawkish games available on Steam: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons; Life is Strange; That Dragon, Cancer; Dear Esther; Narcissu; planetarian; and The Walking Dead among other greats; <b>After Life - Story of a Father<\/b>is probably on the more unpolished side. Yet in stark contrast to its obvious theme it offers a <b>refreshingly creative insight into the ideas of a seldom imagined afterlife using what our protagonist Rick goes through after dying 12 years prematurely.<\/b><br><br>Set in Ireland, Rick's life flashes before his eyes in a manner that is not so typical for the phrase. He lingers in limbo having died before his time in a place that looks very much like space. In a sort of space-time vortex, Rick traverses the past, present and sees the future of his loved ones. It's more like how we'd imagine Scrooge might go forth towards the light years after the events of Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol<\/i>. Rick takes his last journey to make peace with his death through knowing the thoughts and fate of his loved ones.<br><br>One of the most intriguing aspects of the game is<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Gavin<\/span><\/span>, the mysterious voice that talks to Rick and guides him through this voyage. Their short, semi-philosophical colloquy between levels while floating through nothingness serve as an elegant passageway connecting the player between each set of experiences and the characters Rick introduces to us. The ending unveils the long awaited meaning of <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Gavin's<\/span><\/span>existence in Rick's after life and is a heartwarming and fantastic idea that will delight players to realise and comprehend in their own manner. Uncomplicated as the dialogue may be, it boasts a sturdy framework and is never insipid or needlessly drawn out. The length of one playthrough without skipping any of the dialogue\/credits is 2 hours so it isn't a long game. Absent save options mean you'll need to load chapters if you quit midway but since it only consists of 5 parts, each a duration of 20-30 mins (where each time you head to a corner of the world significant to Rick and his family), who needs saves!<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Blink to Remember<\/div>One nuisance does arise due to this however, and this is because of the &quot;blink&quot; mechanic and the sole gamified feature of &quot;memory collection&quot; in-game. This isn't blind, spoon-fed progression with a &quot;walking simulator&quot; granted all you require is a mouse to play (no offence PnC games ;D). Choose direction by moving your mouse, click LMB to float forward slowly, click RMB+LMB together to drift forward swiftly and click RMB to toggle &quot;blink mode&quot;. You need to blink to see where memories are and collecting these experiences in the form of dialogues leads directly to progressing in-game. You need them all and they trigger in a specific order meaning you'll revisit certain areas. When you blink the world fleetingly turns monochrome and you will be able to see beacons of dazzling phosphorescent light shoot to the sky. This beacon is so strong that it even blasts through floors when you're in a building but amusingly cannot be spotted if you're too far away. A few flaws present themselves at this point because if you don't find all the memories, you can't get to the next level, and even if you could I expect most people would rather not skip any important events in what is a wholly story, and character-driven affair. It isn't much of a bother until you get to the last level as Level 1 is easy enough as a tutorial, but by Level 4 I got worried and was bordering on irritated for a few minutes while searching the last few rooms. With no map in a weirdly designed and gargantuan house, it felt a bit eerie and long searching for those vexatiously well spread out final missing memories. It didn't give me much trouble in hindsight, but I have an inkling that was pure luck because I have absolutely naught sense of direction. How wonderful it would be if Rick could see past the wall like a proper little ghost! Other than Rick's disappointing lack of blinking prowess the controls are as smooth as a baby's bottom and in tune with this brilliantly paced game. It offers a broad FOV range which removes any sense of nausea and straight from the beginning I was having a ball. At first look the atmosphere funnily reminded me of what the Heaven Island games <i>should<\/i> have been considering they are actual walking simulators with an addition of bad design causing simulation sickness instead of Zen meditation. After Life contains a relatively plentiful selection of varying scenes and insightful dialogue for the small team indie game it is and never once did things feel overused, dull or repetitive. The voice actors most likely (seems done by an amateur but capable team) ironed out most of the grammatical errors as they recorded since the mistakes are only sporadically present in the captions.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Go raibh mile maith agat<\/div><i>(May you have a thousand good things) - Irish Saying<\/i><br>By the end of the game it feels like a low budget <i>That Dragon, Cancer<\/i>. Both made me cry the same way since I lost my father to a terminal illness when I was young, and each of these games in many ways are about the dad and what they endure whether or not they are the ones dying. Thinking that perhaps my own father could have gone through what Rick did made me want to bury myself under the covers and bawl my eyes out as it is such a splendid and artistically original thought that this developer had. I enjoyed this game more because it isn't a one dimensional look into the pain and suffering of families going through unutterably calamitous loss. That is such an obvious, irrevocable thing that I for one don't need to be reminded of any longer. Instead you will grasp the concept of loss through the eyes of the one that has left us. This game exhibits an entirely different perspective by putting us in the shoes of the loss itself. The person no longer there but unable to leave too quickly guides us through the journey of leaving their life behind much too early. Still it delves less into the emotions of Rick and more of what goes on with those around him after his death and how this affects his moving on with his journey in the after life, which is what makes it all the more thought-provoking and distinct. We hear little brother Rob talk of them chasing skirts as young lads and enjoying life, the wise words and undying love of Rick's mother Aoife, his three children and loving wife Shauna's brave venture into a world void of him, Rick's best friend Vincent with his difficulty handling the trauma but slowly learning to grow from it, and Anlon the loyal guard dog forever waiting for his master to return. These are 12 years filled with remembering, yearning, changing, learning and moving on with life, narrated from a wonderful variance of characters. Satisfyingly well done endings are rare but I felt this had one, which makes all the difference. It ties everything with a pretty ribbon but lets players choose the colour of it.<br><br><i>Tip:<\/i><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Walking slowly actually makes things look divine, just like in real life.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29497970', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29497970' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29497970\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29497970' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29497970\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29497970', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29497970_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29497970_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_container multiple_listing store\" id=\"ReviewDevResponsesummary29497970\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_developer_response_exists_date\">A developer has responded on Jan 26 @ 9:57am<br><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/tawnylawns\/recommended\/550240\/#developer_response\">(view response)<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: both;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29301312\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ClickerKiller\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"138019108\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d296df6d86f08a1f0dbcf4a4d3a39a153720884.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d296df6d86f08a1f0dbcf4a4d3a39a153720884.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/6d\/6d296df6d86f08a1f0dbcf4a4d3a39a153720884_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ClickerKiller\/\" data-miniprofile=\"138019108\">Endure and Survive<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ClickerKiller\/games\/?tab=all\">528 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ClickerKiller\/recommended\/\">17 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ClickerKiller\/recommended\/550240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTL;DR <br><br>This was a nice short game, but it does have its flaws which can easily be corrected.

The script sometimes felt like the relationship of a teacher\/student, employer\/employee. Acting for the most part was good however some parts were not well acted. In a few moments the tone did not change from positive to negative and I didn't feel any emotion to an emotional part of the game... I really like how the dev voiced the character as well and it was based in Ireland, I like the touch and it is a nice change. <br><br>Graphics were well done, the game looks pretty. There were many texture pops on the other hand. As well as the visuals being good the sound was probably my favourite part, I felt the music was very well done in the game. Although... There seems to be a bug where the sound goes completely so I actually had to watch a walkthrough for part 2 instead of play etc... <br><br>Gameplay... Obviously isn't much to talk about. I'm a big big fan of walking sims and interactive stories so honestly little to no gameplay doesn't bother me... However... As much as I love exploring a world I was left wandering aimlessly at multiple points but not because I was looking at the graphics... I was looking for the memories and I found it too much hassle having to find them. I highly recommend instead of using a beacon type blink feature, to use a sort of similar trail in the air or close to ground to the closest memory or the memory you want to come in order. Of course that gives linearity to it but honestly if I want to go off trail to look at the views I will in these types of games no matter how the main story pushes me to follow. I feel like the game does need this feature as I felt like I didn't know if I was going the right way (the first part is literally a circle mainly, should I go clockwise or anti-clockwise etc.) Also, I find it very strange there is no save feature. I know its a short game and it has been split into 4 parts but I feel its essential that there are saves within a game. <br><br>Performance. Normally I tend to leave this out because bugs can be fixed, things like launch issues can be solved in the community, fps is mostly dependent on the hardware and so on... Yet, I feel like the &quot;game&quot; itself was done last minute. Clipping was a massive issue, texture pops were common and I feel like the camera was full of faults. I feel like the sensitivity should be set higher by default, minor fix but I've seen it complained about a lot so it may save hassle in the future. I feel using the mouse to move feels unnatural, I figured out that I could use WASD later... I really wish the tutorial explained the two methods of movement through a diagram split in two like a lot of games do. I seen that you intended to have movement mouse only but I don't feel its necessary to focus on it so much. <br><br>I know this is a very negative review for a seemingly positive review. Normally I would downvote and rant away. However, I feel like this game can be and will be improved in the future so I want people to support you guys! I'll be looking forward to seeing more games\/stories from you hopefully a little more polished. <br><br>Overall, I feel like this was a nice short game, but it does have its flaws which can for the most part be easily be corrected. I'd give it 6\/10\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29301312', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29301312' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29301312\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29301312' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29301312\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29301312', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29301312_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29301312_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28764494\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/iNathannn\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"113368610\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/0649fe68f74b38890e93347891b56b72e88c417d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/0649fe68f74b38890e93347891b56b72e88c417d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/06\/0649fe68f74b38890e93347891b56b72e88c417d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/iNathannn\/\" data-miniprofile=\"113368610\">\u272b iNathannn \u272b<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/iNathannn\/games\/?tab=all\">249 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/iNathannn\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/iNathannn\/recommended\/550240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">2.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 28, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVery good story and very Interesting.

We played 'The Park' on our channel and were bored out of our mind half way through it.<br><br>With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this, Once you get through the first part, learning what's going on, it hooks you in and you want to know more. You are truly learning about someone's life before and after. <br><br>The Families stories are fantastic and very believable, Its all very well written and very well put together.<br><br>It looks beautiful and the music is amazing. There is some clipping, you can get lost in the dark at times the camera can be annoying but nothing is so bad it takes you away from the story and this game is all about the story. <br><br>The voice acting it on point for the most part. With only one or two let downs at times. I can only imagine how hard it is for a voice actor to proform such deep feelings of loss and grief. <br>I genuinely got choked up with Vincent's lines and his part as the best friend. There is something for everyone to relate to and make you think about life after death.<br><br>All round a great game, I would have loved some little puzzles to solve or something extra to do, But I only thought about that after playing it, not while playing. I was completely engrossed in the dialogue. <br><br>I would love to forget I played this game, just so I could play it again. <br>Can't recommend it enough. Give it a go.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-7ws1JdYoVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-7ws1JdYoVk<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28518286', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28518286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28518286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28518286' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28518286\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28518286', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28518286_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28518286_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29418573\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haydari\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"131032168\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f4\/f4d3d234aab526a77eed6d8943c88a9031f9d39a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f4\/f4d3d234aab526a77eed6d8943c88a9031f9d39a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f4\/f4d3d234aab526a77eed6d8943c88a9031f9d39a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haydari\/\" data-miniprofile=\"131032168\">lupuscaucasus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haydari\/games\/?tab=all\">3,474 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haydari\/recommended\/\">54 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/haydari\/recommended\/550240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter Life is a small walking simulator. You are a bodyess soul of a father who wants to see his family's future. You have a guide who helps you to collect memories of your family. Te whole playtime takes about 3 hours. The story is solid. The visuals are good but there are a few glitches. Sometimes you can see the next room through the walls. The audio is perfect. The worst part of the game is the beacon system shows the important locations. In the 2nd chapter the rain effect makes it hard to see. In the 4th chapter, you can't see any beacons because you're in a huge house. I mean big when I say big. I think it's 800 m2 or so. Plus, it's really dark inside and it makes so easy to get lost. There is an audible guiding system also but it's not as efficient as the beacons. If you like the walking simulators and interactive fictionI highly recommend the After Life. Personally, the most brilliant part of the game was the dog's thoughts.

Its not so much a game as a thought provoking exploration of how we come to terms with the loss of a loved one. Told from the point of view of Rick, a father who has died suddenly, we follow along on his journey as he remembers significant moments in his family's lives, and witness how each of them deal with his loss.<br><br>This is an emotional story that is told in a sensitive and thoughtful way. It is incredibly well written and acted, and the music and visuals are really well done.

Overall, it's a very moving, touching experience, but let me get the nitpicks out of the way first.<br><br>For starters, the game's a little buggy here and there; I had memories pop up that subsequently didn't play anything, some that would play stuff I'd already heard, and a few that seemed to be popping up in the wrong places. It's a minor issue, and the developer seems to be working on fixing things judging by the update posts, so credit to that.<br><br>Another thing that got to me after a while is the space of each stage versus how fast you can move. The expansive areas feel a bit more real, but it can be quite the slog to get through them, even with boosting with the right mouse button.<br><br>Thirdly, I would've appreciated a better explanation for how the Blink mechanic worked early on. It took me a stage and a half to realize the positions and volume in my headphones indicated direction and distance to new memories. A visual indicator element around the edge of the screen might have been nice, too, albeit less essential.<br><br>Aside from those minor points, like I said, After Life was great. The voice acting was pretty solid overall, and the story was easy to piece together despite memories not always being found in order. There were plenty of bits I found I could identify with in my own life, and even if you've been more fortunate than others when it comes to your loved ones, it's still a very human tale. I definitely recommend picking up After Life - Story Of A Father, and maybe grabbing some tissues if you're a softy.<br><br>(Disclosure: Requested a key for this game because I like this sort of human story thing, and got one.)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28356996', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28356996' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28356996\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28356996' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28356996\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28356996', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28356996_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28356996_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary27903187\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296207906\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"335942178\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f84a6eb57af45fda0e10836cefcfd337ee0b968.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f84a6eb57af45fda0e10836cefcfd337ee0b968.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/8f\/8f84a6eb57af45fda0e10836cefcfd337ee0b968_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296207906\/\" data-miniprofile=\"335942178\">Faze Niko<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296207906\/games\/?tab=all\">23 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296207906\/recommended\/\">3 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198296207906\/recommended\/550240\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGood game did a video on it.
