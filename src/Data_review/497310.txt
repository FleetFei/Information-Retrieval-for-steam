Compared to most digital painting software, it has a truckload of tools.  'run as administrator' mode may be required.  All tool grouping and keyboard shortcuts are non-standard and will make sense after a while.<br><br>My 4 year old loves to use this program as of recent to paint.  My wife also enjoys using this program to paint.  It's a lot more than people think it is.  It's too bad people aren't playing with it more to see that<br><br>Update: As of more recent testing, I'd say DCI 2K Native(2048 x 1080) is as large as you should go if you're planning to use the various plugins(k), like starfield.<br><br>Update: As of most recent testing, PD Particles seems to handle A4 720ppi on my computer. (It does not handle A4 1200ppi on my computer.)  To put this into numbers, normal HD is 1280 x 720, nice HD is 1920 x 1080, yet A4 720ppi is 5953 x 8419.  <i>However, PD Particles does not handle 9921 x 14032 (A4 1200ppi) on my computer.<\/i><br><br>There are no negatives at this price.  <br><br>In what ways is Particles unequal to Howler?<br><br>Particles lacks a great many filters which Howler has and the depth of many filters that are available when compared to Howler's version of those filters.  Animation Cells(animation cells inside of custom brushes are in Particles) and Video Editing are not present in Particles, but are present in Howler.  Creating mountains and clouds through generated 3d extrusion\/beveling and effects in Howler using the 3d designer is not present in Particles.  3d extrusion for graphs, walls, and roughed out cities is in Howler through Puppy Ray, but is not in Particles.  It seems to me that Howler 10 has more processor available to it for functions, perhaps it is better at utilizing the GPU when it needs to or perhaps it is better at utilizing the CPU more fully when it needs to.  There are more menu options for the various buffers in Howler 10, you can simply do more with various buffers in Howler 10 than in Particles 9 because the menu options are there to select.<br><br>In what ways is Particles equal to Howler?<br><br>The brushes.  Particles has the particles, bristles, orbicles, foliage brush types, and the fx buffer brush styles, the animated custom brushes, and the detailed customization of the brushes.  Saving custom brushes as images so the transparency works in the png file format is present too.  If you focus on painting and appreciate the unique benefits that digital brushes can offer, then Particles is as good as Howler in many ways.  If you live in the highway lane of digital shortcuts, then Particles isn't a good fit for you.<br><br>In what ways is Particles unequal to natural painting?<br><br>If you're used to the brush... digital is... never perfect, but it has it's advantages that are worth experiencing.  <br>However, if you do chinese\/japanese painting with multi color loading, direction and pressure and rotation determining your gradients on the fly, use speed to create effects of hardness, and do everything in one stroke watching the watercolor lighten slightly each stroke till gone, and only loading the tip when desired to keep a thin dark for a leaf or part of a flower petal ...then there is nothing out there that does this.  Maybe someday, but for now, the emulation just doesn't exist.  The speed emulation exists on Fresh Paint by Microsoft and there are other attempts to create this... but if you do this style of painting, don't expect a digital equivalent, because there isn't one available.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25847824', 'summary' );

As far as I'm aware it's the only piece of art software like this on steam that is this cheap so if you have limited needs and are willing to overlook all the usability problems, weirdness and issues then I can recommend it. For actual artists and people who will be using the program a lot though, I would say buy PD Howler 10 instead.<br>Issues:<br><br>The documentation on the web that the program links to seems to be for the more expensive version of the software and consequently it mentions features that aren't in this software.<br><br>There seems to be no way in the program to change the key bindings. The documentation makes no mention as far as I can tell of how to rebind the keys, if it's even possible.<br><br>I really don't like the way colour is handled in the program. The only indication of the current drawing colour is a tiny square on the toolbar. Even when you're changing the colour in some of the colour picking tools you have to look over to this tiny square to see what the current colour looks like. It's not good enough. There also seems to be no way to change the current colour by HSL or HSB or RGB sliders. The documentation mentions ways, but it is referring to controls in the sidebar that don't exist in this program, only the more expensive version. I must say, these controls look very useful and if they were cut out on purpose from the budget version to annoy you and make you upgrade, that is just mean-spirited.<br><br>[edit: Tried out the demo of Howler and these colour controls in the sidebar are indeed fantastic. This program: Particles completely omits the sidebar with all its useful controls. What's even worse, the very first version of Particles, I've discovered, did have all these controls too, so they have not just cut stuff out of the full Howler to bring you cheapo particles, they have cut stuff from cheapo particles over the years to make it even less feature-rich too!]<br><br><br>The controls you have to change the current colour are:<br><br>1) The colour picker. This is an annoyingly modal dialogue (can't do anything else while it's up). It is reached by clickng on the tiny square that shows current colour on the toolbar. It does have a few tabs for different ways to change the colour but while it displays accurate RGB, HSV etc. values there is no way to change these by slider or numeric input, you can only drag around on the pallete display (the block of blended colours) and see what the result is.<br><br>2) A quick colour and brush preset picker activated by pressing space. This suffers from the previously mentioned problem where you can only see the colour you're selecting by looking over at the tiny square on the toolbar. This is a really awful design decision. It would have been so easy to put a big block of the currently selected colour on the picker itself.<br><br>3) A colour picker on the bottom of the window that is at least non-modal (can have up all the time). This has no numeric info at all and is just a colour wheel and triangle affair with complementary colours displayed. Again, same problem, currently selected colour only shown in the toolbar's tiny square.<br><br>There seems to be no real palette option. There's &quot;themes&quot; which are sets of up to 6 colours (though bizarrely if you make your own themes you are limited to 5 for some reason). The problem with themes is there seems to be no way to actually select an individual colour from the theme to draw with. Instead all you can do is turn on a &quot;swatch&quot; at the bottom of the screen which has a blend of colours based on the colours from the theme. This swatch is not to my liking in form factor, long and thin- I don't think it is very easy to select colours this way. It also suffers from being positioned right next to the horizontal scrollbar for the canvas which can cause misclicking problems.<br><br>There's also some weirdness going on in the links between themes and the colour picker (The one reached via the toolbar). You can load in a theme from the colour picker but it is not picked up by the theme controls. Basically the theme controls have these 5 circles you can drag around to make a theme, which you can then save, but when you load a theme, even if you're doing it from the very control for creating themes itself, it doesn't update the controls to show the theme. I suspect this is because the preset themes can have up to 6 colours in and the user is limited to creating themes with 5 colours. This was not a wise design decision.<br><br>OK finished with colours, let's get on with more annoyances.<br><br>The UI seems to be the product of a series of updates. It is inconsistent. For example most of the dialogues have a control to change the numeric value by slider but on some of them (e.g. particles) there is none and you have to use the keyboard. Another example, sub-windows that pop up normally have a close x on the top right but the one for the program options does not. This leads to the annoying feature that you click the dialogue, mess with some settings, think better of it and then there's no way to cancel the changes, only &quot;save&quot; or &quot;use&quot;.<br><br>There are no layers.<br><br>A lot of the brushes, e.g. crosshatch, water colour brushes look fine most of the time if you're painting with them, but the fact that they are fixed images as a brush becomes obvious if you paint single drops, and also on the edge of lines. While the physical characteristics of things like sponges and bristle brushes would lead to some regularity of this nature it looks artificial here. With crosshatch it's particularly bad though. It would be better to have the hatching done procedurally as you draw. Mentioning this seems petty given the more important issues above but I thought I'd throw it in there.<br><br>To sum up, the software is a cheap painting program on steam. If that's all you want then go for it. It is capable of producing some good looking results. It basically is, and feels and looks cut down though (from the full PD Howler, I assume). The lack of layers and any sort of decent colour selection and the small number of filters mean this is not a good choice at all for artists.<br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>I apologise for this not being a proper review but a jumbled collection of thoughts. This replaces my original &quot;review&quot; which mentioned Krita (a free painting program) a lot as a comparison. I mention this so you can make sense of the comments.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25580277', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25580277' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25580277\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25580277' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25580277\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25580277', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25580277_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25580277_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/497310\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 5 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25847824","29152728","25580277"]}
