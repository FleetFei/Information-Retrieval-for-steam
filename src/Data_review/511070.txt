Said that, I have to say here that the Dev is really a nice guy and maybe one of the closed &quot;down to earth&quot; guys\/devs i met so far (Konami, Capcom, you guys should learn something from this guy, srs!).<br><br>Said that, he also asked me to review the game.<br>So first, i bought the game (i didnt got a free key) coz i wanted the game. Now i have it, played it and can gladly review it.<br><br>As the dev already uses the main line &quot;If Lemmings meets Boulder Dash&quot;, thats kinda the gameplay this game offers.<br><br>You have a Number of &quot;Miners&quot;, which looks a lot like the classic Lemmings (if you compair them you can see a bit changed but still, they REALLY looks like the original Lemmings) which also act like the Lemmings:<br>They walk around till they hit a object and turn around, falling off cliffs &amp; like, drown in water, die if they explode and like.<br><br>Already with that in mind, you get this &quot;Lemmings vibe&quot;.<br><br>But where is the &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; part now you will ask?<br>Well, the &quot;main part&quot; (i use this word with caution, you will see later why) of this game is to use abilitys with this said Miners in the style of Lemmings to dig around the map you choosed from, getting Gems\/Jewels and like, avoiding ice, boulders which can fall and crush your Miners, explosivs, gas-pockets and other things which can easy destroy\/kill your Miners.<br><br>If you got the said Gems\/Jewels, here begins the other part of the game: Get the Miner back to your Home with this Gems\/Jewels in one piece.<br><br>So its not only a &quot;How deep can you dig&quot; Game, its also a &quot;How can i dig and be Save to come home&quot; Game.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Plays fluend...but it feels like something is missing...<\/div><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=885327142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=885327142<\/a><br><br>As i got the game, I already loved it but a lot stuff was missing or made the game kinda feel &quot;unfair&quot;. I shortly after talked with the dev and i gave him some ideas like:<br>- A Jewelbag a Miner loses if he dies so another Miner can collect the Bag with all the lost Jewels.<br>- Coins which give you some cash instandly (unlike Gems\/Jewels which have to be brought back home first).<br>- More Weapons like a Bomb for laying, Lasers for destroying explosives or other obstacles and a flamer for digging out a smaller area<br>- Mini missions which gives you a small challange.<br><br>Of course, the dev had some own ideas and thrown them in (its his game, after  all) and just with this &quot;little things&quot;, the game makes a whole lot fun. The Jewelbag makes it not so hard if you lost your Miner on the way back home, the Coins let you buy some abilitys wile youre digging and the Weapons work more as tools (at least that was my idea) you can use if you need them.<br><br><br><br><br><b>But i have to be honest.<\/b><br>It sure is a nice game and i played it for a long time as i got it and as the Dev build in all the new ideas and co but after a wile it got a bit &quot;boring&quot; and now i play it more &quot;ones in a wile&quot;. Again, i really <b>love<\/b> the idea and the game, mixing 2 great games from not only my childhood.<br><br>The problem i have (at least) is that this said &quot;main part&quot; (here i come back to it) has not really any kind of &quot;goal&quot;.<br>Its not like Lemmings where you actually have to save a number of Lemmings or Boulder Dash where you have to collect a number of gems and find the exit.<br><br>It sure mixes the gameplay very (<b>VERY<\/b>) well but it misses the side of &quot;complied&quot; something:<br>You dig around with abilitys which you also have to buy again after using a said ability. You get money by either collecting a coin or bring back gems\/jewels back to your home. If you bring said gems\/jewels back to your home, you buy with the money you get from them said abilitys and go digging, returning into the circle ones again.<br><br>Its not like it is a bad idea, the problem is just it misses something &quot;why&quot; youre going to dig in the first place.<br>Let me explain that:<br>If i buy me a pickaxe <b>just<\/b> to dig around and get a jewel, bring it back home, selling it <b>just<\/b> for buying myself <b>another<\/b> pickaxe.....i guess you see what i try to explain...<br><br>It misses a kind of &quot;goal&quot; to be honest. Something like you &quot;have to do&quot; or &quot;upgrate&quot; or like. I said in my review what Lemmings &amp; Boulder Dashs goal was. Those might not fit for this game but i could image like you have to build a city with that money or upgrate your Miners with it - a bit like in Terraria or games like...(not in the gameplay)<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Are the Miners worth digging?<\/div><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=871526315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\">http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=871526315<\/a><br>So is the game really worth playing?<br>I <b>do recomment it<\/b> since it is a good game and a good idea. Next to this, you can talk with the dev (who is begging for feedbacks to make the game better (in a good way)) about ideas and he might add those. The game plays nice but you will end like me maybe, playing it a bit longer at the first time and ending up playing it ones in a wile. Thats actually not bad but as i already said, &quot;Its like a raw diamond which needs to be cut and polished&quot;, meaning that it lacks of a goal why youre going to dig around at the first place. It is really nice and it can keep you busy (i played it ones 3 hours in one sitting, forgot the time wile i did) but after a longer time you might begin to ask yourself the same question, where is the goal behind it. <br><br>I will say, for 5 bucks, it really is a nice game and for that what you get you actually cant complain about a really nice old-school digging game. Still, as i said, something like a &quot;reason&quot;, a &quot;goal&quot; why youre going to dig would be really nice.<br><br>If i would give it a score it would be a 7 our of 10 since its nicely made but missing a &quot;special something to make it whole&quot;.<br><br>And at the end for this review, here a fanmade trailer (so yea, i really like this game)<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=872949889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=872949889<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30571983', 'summary' );

A hybrid of Boulder Dash &amp; Lemmings, in this game you release miners which you control in a similar manner to Lemmings, the aim being to have them explore the map, dig &amp; find precious materials, whilst avoiding dangers such as explosives, gas, long falls &amp; so on. To receive any rewards once the gems &amp; other elements have been collected you need to get your miners back home which is often the hardest part.<br><br>The game seems pretty stable though it could do with a little more polish. Although gameplay is fairly easy to pick up I would have liked to see an in game tutorial. Whilst the game is score based there are a nice collection of achievements to offer additional objectives.<br><br>I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this game in a bundle or when discounted 50%+. Given the current depth I'd struggle to recommend it at full price, however although not in early access the dev is still working on the game &amp; is both very enthusiastic about this project &amp; accommodating of suggestions. This fact alone sways my decision in favour of suggesting anyone who thinks they like the concept to give it a go.<br><br>As the dev himself suggests, try it &amp; if you're not happy, get a quick refund. I get the impression that if just a handful of Lemmings fans get into this game &amp; give the dev good feedback, he'll be able to take the game that bit further &amp; with a smidgeon of luck turn it into a tiny sparkling gem.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26059992', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26059992' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26059992\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26059992' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26059992\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26059992', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26059992_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26059992_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/recommended\/511070\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26127580\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"9036068\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/8552fb8fb0cb9a21a2fa948fea2c99bf0c099aac.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/8552fb8fb0cb9a21a2fa948fea2c99bf0c099aac.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/85\/8552fb8fb0cb9a21a2fa948fea2c99bf0c099aac_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/\" data-miniprofile=\"9036068\">sgtknightmare<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/games\/?tab=all\">568 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/sgtknightmare\/recommended\/511070\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCharming old school mining game!!!<br><br>BEWARE!!!

The game comes in 3 difficulty settings, Easy, Medium and Hard. No gamemodes beyond the current one, of course, but why would there need to be?<br>The game is simply explained aswell. Release miners (basically your lemmings) from the house and go about controlling them in an almost identical fashion to the Lemmings games to traverse through every nook and crany of the map, collecting gems and other valubles which increase your highscore if you manage to successfully get them home.<br><br>I bought this game myself shortly after coming into contact with the developer on steam. He was very kind and so I thought I would do my part and at least give his game a go. I'm glad I had. I had issues at first with the key bindings, but upon asking him about it, the game was soon updated to include tool-tips to remind the player of the keybindings. I have never met a developer who is so considerate of the needs of his customers.<br>This brings me on to his dedication. This game appears to be, despite what the update logs say, recieving updates (be it minor or large) on almost a daily basis. I can't deny that I'm surprised. I've genuinely been given the impression that he really, and I mean REALLY, cares about his work.<br><br>More about the game though. It plays a little clunky, I have had troubles from time to time controlling my miners but that may be entirely down to how incompetent I am at the game. I don't believe the game looks particually polished graphically and I can't help but feel like the game would have been better in early access, in the sense that the developer is planning for so many more features to be added that it almost seems like it's not quite finished. However, for this kind of game, graphics don't matter anywhere near as much as they might in other games.<br>Non-the-less, I believe the game for such a small price of \u00a34.99 is definitely worth a shot (there's always the refund system if it doesn't turn out to be what you're looking for), there's a lot of fun to be had. Perfectionists will love doing the same levels in order to get the highest scores possible and casuals will love to pop on, play a short game and come off again. It really does feel like a new lemmings game but with more replayability, so if you were looking for more Lemmings or just a game that brings something completely different to the table unlike the usual over saturated \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on steam, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that MANIC MINERS might tickle your fancy.<br><br>I really, whole-heartedly, recommend taking a look at this game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25166815', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25166815' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25166815\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25166815' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25166815\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25166815', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25166815_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25166815_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/511070\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 6 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["30571983","26059992","26127580","25166815"]}
