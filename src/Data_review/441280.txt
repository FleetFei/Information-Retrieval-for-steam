I honestly couldn't find anything to dislike about it.<br><br>Felt like sort of a mix of Metroid &amp; Mega Man. Good amount of content - 7 Stages, a prologue, and a boss rush mode. Always with at least one boss per stage. Boss fights are well balanced and never cheap, and have an arcade-style feel to them. The difficulty level felt just about right on &quot;hard&quot; setting, so I'd recommend starting there unless you're completely new to the genre - it's really not very hard, especially with collectibles, powerups, and save points littered all over the place. That setting makes it just difficult enough that you may want to learn the boss moves &amp; think about your approach a bit.<br><br>Similar to the old Metroid games, you'll pass some obvious barriers that require an ability you don't have yet, and will have to return later to explore new areas after gaining those abilities. The backtracking isn't bad and generally only takes a minute or two since you can stage select (and sometimes skip various portions of a stage). I think revisiting old stages is also optional for the most part, and not necessary to progress. <br><br>Collectibles are done well and add to the experience rather than being a chore to hunt down - they generally add stats or a new ability, or are used in less obvious ways. They all have some flavor text too.<br><br>Some people are hating on the car level, but I didn't find it to be overly jarring or out of place. It will just take a few tries to get through. If you're familiar with the old Donkey Kong Country games, its basically a mine cart level with lots of pits to fall in. And it does at least warn you of upcoming jumps and have several checkpoints mixed in.<br><br>Biggest negative I experienced was some slowdown which required me to rework my nVidia settings a bit. For whatever reason, I had to manually enable v-sync and triple buffering in nVidia (and enable v-sync in game settings also) to make things run smoothly. However, I seem to be in the minority with this issue.<br><br>Overall: Highly recommended. Totally worth my $10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30514655', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30514655' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30514655\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30514655' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30514655\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30514655', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30514655_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30514655_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/441280\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">12 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary22154966\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/14\/1448615e2b86bbfb93080d55bef3c90248a51fec_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"18439472\">pepsimanvsjoe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,486 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/\">244 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/pepsimanvsjoe\/recommended\/441280\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">6.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 30, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHonestly, it's taken me more than a few days to write something significant about <i>Pharaoh Rebirth+<\/i>. It's not enough for me to say that this is a really good game, and that it's a hidden gem well-deserving of your time. I have to write something that goes above and beyond, so that you come away thinking &quot;Wow! This is serious! I must play this game immediately!&quot; This is the difficulty I've run into when writing about games that are really impressive. Aside from having a mediocre vocabulary, I'm too used to discussing what's wrong with games, to really explain what's right with them.<br><br>For example, let's start with the controls. When the controls are thoroughly solid, then there's actually nothing to discuss. In this game, moving the anthropomorphic rabbit around is as natural and easy as turning one's palm. The controls are so good, that you won't notice them. They're like an extension of yourself. As the game progresses, Jonathan (the rabbit) acquires new moves and abilities, and the experience continues to be perfectly seamless. Another aspect that goes un-noticed when it's handled properly is the mechanics. The hit-boxes are great, the game doesn't try your patience with cheap hits, and nothing stands out... poorly. <br><br>Oft-times with Metroidvanias, there's only so much of an incentive to explore. <i>Pharaoh Rebirth+<\/i> strikes a good middle-ground with its plethora of collectible treasures. What makes exploration interesting is that not all of the items are helpful. Some exist solely to fill slots in your collection screen, while others can boost stats or award hidden skills. This adds another layer of mystery to the adventure. Every time you discover a hidden artifact, you gain a sense of anticipation. Whereas in most other similarly-designed games, all you have to look forward to is another heart container, or a slightly larger box to hold more daffodils. When you fight enemies in that other game, are you even using the daffodils? It's a completely meaningless collectible. <br><br>The sub-weapons in this game are not only fun to use, but they're also very helpful. While Jonathan's ears are just as deadly as any whip, the sub-weapons allow you to approach situations and bosses in different ways. Some of them can have other uses as well. There's a certain point very late in the game where you're faced with a spike pit. Over this pit is a floor, but most of the sections are false, and you'll fall to your death if you attempt to cross. The first weapon you obtain is a machine-gun... that fires tennis balls. As they bounce across the ground, they'll helpfully point out which sections of the floor are false, so you can safely pass. It reminds me of <i>Megaman 2<\/i>.<br><br>These days, it seems like every indie title references classic games from the distant past. Thankfully, <i>Pharaoh Rebirth+<\/i> sets itself apart by implementing its references in a clever manner. As far as I can tell, the least subtle reference is one of the characters having the name Belmondo. Just from playing through the game, the Konami influences are pretty clear, but you're not going to get hit over the head with them. It also helps that the character-designs are charming and have their own unique look. The soundtrack is thoroughly fantastic as well.<br><br>For the most part, the level-design is superb. Since every stage is self-contained, there isn't a need to make sure that each location connects to the others. The stages are well-designed, so that the first play-through is sufficiently enthralling. Also, you're welcome to repeat stages to find all of the hidden treasures. In many cases this is required, since the double-jump isn't available until towards the end. When repeating a previously-cleared stage, the pacing is speedy, and you can even take advantage of a few shortcuts.<br><br>But you're probably wondering what I meant when I wrote &quot;For the most part&quot;. Well, this game has a vehicle-section. In stage 4, you have to drive a jeep. Actually, you don't drive it so much as time jumps to avoid plummeting to your death. To start things off with a positive I can say this much: It could've been a lot worse. There are visual and audio warnings when a jump is coming, and there are four checkpoints, which is pretty generous for a section that should take less than four minutes. <br><br>Still, &quot;driving the jeep&quot; in <i>Pharaoh Rebirth+<\/i> is a textbook example of everything that's wrong with vehicle-sections. Several years ago, I actually wrote an opinion-piece on the subject. Looking back at it now, &quot;driving the jeep&quot; covers all of the bases. I played through this game on the normal level of difficulty, and I died more times on the jeep than anywhere else in the game. A sizable number of these deaths can also be attributed to the annoyingly-placed treasures throughout the stage. Also, If I want to 100% complete the game and get all of the achievements, I have to perfect my driving skills. To that I say: No thanks. All that said, the vehicle-section in this game isn't terrible, and it probably won't grind everything to a screeching halt, but I would have gladly traded this section away for a fully-featured stage.<br><br>The only other complaint I have is that you can only have one save-game at a time. I suppose this could be worked around by moving the old save-file to a different folder. I'll have to give it a shot sometime, because I'm really curious about the hard difficulty-setting.<br><br>Aside from an unfortunate vehicle-section, <i>Pharaoh Rebirth+<\/i> is a superb game. It's a reminder that yes, even today there are great 16-bit\/32-bit inspired action-platformers getting released. It's a shame I couldn't come up with anything significant to say though. What can I say? Even when I recognize quality, it's tough to put together the words that do it justice.<br><br><i>Disclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.<\/i><br><br><i>If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/Original_Curators_Group#curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Follow Original Curator Group<\/a><\/i>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22154966', 'summary' );

Along your journey you have a variety of ways to defend yourself against the game's varied amount of enemies and traps. You have a basic forward attack, an upward swing, and the ever useful, aerial somersault. Each attack will have it's own advantages and disadvantages, for example, the normal attack does a ton of damage but have limited reach and utility. While the aerial somersault is incredibly useful for comboing, protecting yourself from oncoming projectiles, and for control of a given combat scenario, however, it's weaker than your basic attack. You also have a quick dodge \/ dash that you can use for both maneuverability, as well as bypassing incoming projectiles. Along your travels you'll also come across items of varying degree. Some items will give you passive buffs, while others are active, and can be used to heal, buff, and some are even usable weapons. As you continue through the game you'll find many more skills, items, and weapons. This is essentially the core of what makes up Pharaoh Rebirth.<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=40NrVqes0s8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=40NrVqes0s8<\/a><br>Pharaoh Rebirth's visuals are well illustrated and animated. The frames are smooth, and the pixel art professional looking. The overall design is rather cutesy, but not so overbearingly so, that you'll be ashamed to play it in public. It's overall aesthetic quality is great, but it is mired by technical limitations. There is no native resolution, no 1080p, or even simply a wide screen mode. If you set the game to &quot;full screen&quot; on the pre-launch menu, you'll be greeted with stretched pixels, and distorted images. Even when set to Windowed mode, the game will launch as a tiny 640 X 640 square, where you'll have to manually stretch the game, doing your best not to stretch the pixels out side of it's originally designed resolution. To say the least, this is not optimal.<br><br>The game itself is a very enjoyable romp, that offers a fair challenge to the player, while maintaining a very accessible set of mechanics that most could quickly understand within just a few minutes of play. Though it's simple at first, you'll find yourself dying more than once as you progress. Enemies take off large chunks of life, and there is no health regen except very specifically located check points. Trial and error will be your best teacher. As you would expect from a metroidvania style of game you'll be fighting bad guys, and exploring the map which seems like a fine endeavor, however, there doesn't seem to be any real map makers, compass, minimap, or even... a map at all. The player will be forced to rely on memory, or in my case, pure attrition to make it out of any given stage.<br><br>Overall Pharaoh Rebirth is a satisfying, and enjoyable action platformer with some metroidvania style mechanics for good measure. The combat and map design are enjoyable, creative, and just deep enough to keep players entertained, however, what is an otherwise very enjoyable game is mired by technical limitations with it's resolution, and player conveniences such as a map.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Enjoyable combat and boss fights<br>- Just deep and challenging enough to satisfy <br>- Simple enough for casual play<br>- Excellent animation and pixel art<br><br>Cons:<br>- No map (That I could find)<br>- Terrible resolution options<br><br>\u25ba Pharaoh Rebirth hours played: 3.5<br>\u25ba Completion Status on Pharaoh Rebirth: Incomplete<br>\u25ba This copy of Pharaoh Rebirth was provided by the developer \/ publisher\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21905963', 'summary' );

flair to it.<br><br>The player takes control of Jonathan Banfield, an archaeologist that was cursed and turned into a silly rabbit.<br><br>I stumbled upon this game just a few weeks before release and I was baffled by the overall lack of publicity and awareness of its existence. It's really a shame because there's so much care put into this work that might get overshadowed by tons of pointless &quot;retro&quot; platformers which come out every day.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br>Mechanics-wise, the game is pretty solid. There are various moves that can be executed from the start and others to be unlocked. Overall, combat works as intended and every enemy or boss has a dinstinct pattern that often intersects nicely with the level layouts.<br><br>Player progression is not based on elements borrowed from RPG's like experience points or equipment, but instead rewards exploring and collecting the different, unique treasures scattered through the ruins and temples of Egypt.<br><br>Instead of presenting itself with one, massive area that blocks your progress whenever you don't possess the right ability to get through, the game has a standard, stage-based structure. This helps in limiting both the backtracking factor and the typical &quot;fake sense of freedom&quot; of the genre.<br><br>I found the level design to be quite clever, as it encourages exploration by showing the player unaccessible routes right from the start, but never requires to backtrack to a previous stage to get to the next. This means freedom of choosing  to get on with the story OR to go back and replay a chapter to get all the extra stuff which could come in handy, without being forced to revisit some old areas to get a mandatory powerup.<br><br>The classic stage-based structure also makes it easier to carry out more action-oriented set pieces, like a helicopter pursuit or a mine car ride.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Art Direction<\/div><br>Technically speaking, Pharaoh Rebirth+ looks and sounds great. The high-res (640x480) nicely crafted and animated pixel art is matched by an upbeat, memorable soundrack which features an obvious Egyptian vibe. However, digitally painted character portraits that show up during radio chatter fall a bit short, as they look detached from the overall style and don't really match its quality.<br><br>I recommend playing the game using its original 4:3 ratio, as stretching 2D art is a crime, especially when it's done so well.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Technical Issues<\/div><br>As of today, screen resolution selection and VSync have been fixed, so I don't have anything else to report at this time.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">So, should I play it?<\/div><br>YES, you should.

I still stand by everything I said in my review about the game itself, but this REALLY needs to be fixed. I recommend backing up your saves in case something bad happens (especially do this at the start of the Cairo level), nonetheless, a; big problem to take note of. I suspect it happens specifically for that specific boss because it's not a battle that you can spawn out later; it may also happen to other non-&quot;Guardian&quot; bosses that don't re-spawn. So just to be safe, occasionally back-up your saves and\/or try to beat bosses instantly once you come across them. I'm conflicted because this is a fantastic game everyone should experience but something really awkward happened while I was playing it. Just... keep your save file safe, and if something similar DOES happen to you too please report it ASAP.<br><br>===Original unedited review===<br><br>Krobon, a depressingly little-known Japanese indie developer, along with composer Pepo and illustrator Doromizu, made one of the finest indie games I've ever played: treasure-hunting, exploratory platform game with the showmanship and over-the-top, inventive craziness of the best arcade games. Before I continue praising this game though, I'll have to make a little side-note: those expecting the interconnected worlds of traditional &quot;Metroidvanias&quot; might be disappointed: this game features a more streamlined, stage-based layout. Don't mistake &quot;streamlining&quot; for &quot;hand-holding&quot;, though; all the hidden passages and invisible walls are for you to discover; the enemies and platforming for you to defeat, as they can and will kill you if you're not paying attention or using your skills effectively (on that note I recommend playing on Hard mode for the best experience). Krobon offers us some absolutely out-there scenarios presented in a suitably exaggerated way, including (I'll try to make this as non-spoilerish as possible by not giving away the context, though feel free to skip the paragraph if you're bothered by even the most minor of spoilers) **********dodging lasers from outer-space while using a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure-like Stand to beat up crazed Egyptian hotel employees. And you can also get drunk off your \u2665\u2665\u2665 while doing so.***********. Yes, that is a thing that happens.<br><br>The gameplay is pretty much as good as this type of game gets; the controls are spotless, the difficulty curve is near-perfect (maybe the first Guardian boss is a LITTLE too hard given what came before, but that's a massive nitpick), the levels are well-designed and nicely varied... and perhaps best of all, the game doesn't let you ruin its challenge by allowing you to mindlessly grind. The ONLY way to build your stats in this game is by exploring the levels and finding hidden items, which is perfect for the tone of the game. The unlocking of skills and thus areas that were inaccessible in the past is gradual, yet just fast enough to make you feel like you're constantly making progress and getting stronger as you go along on your epic adventure. To avoid any hassle, though, I recommend screencapping the mini-map whenever you uncover a dead end that requires a later skill; or, if you're THAT type of player, drawing your own map using pencil and paper. Some might take issue with the car-driving stage and the somewhat trial-and-error way of collecting all the treasure by making blind jumps. Another minor gripe is the lack of a fast-travel system, which I personally would have liked; but, much like this game's other flaws, it is just that: a minor gripe that shouldn't keep you from playing this game (after all, the stage-based setup is kind of like a fast travel system of its own and the levels become easier to navigate as you unlock more skills). Another such minor gripe includes the lack of specific sliders for music and sound; there's just a simple sound volume slider and that's it.<br><br>Narratively, Rebirth does a great job for what it is; the dialogue never felt like it was wasting my time, and if YOU feel like it's wasting yours, you can always skip pretty much every cutscene, even if you haven't gone through it before. I don't recommend it, though; the presentation as a whole actually makes you feel like you're really an archeologist, exploring every nook and cranny of a strange yet often surprisingly serious cartoon world. In fact, the juxtaposition of comedic shenanigans with dramatic moments and even little nuggets of brief yet oddly-fitting sociopolitical commentary make the writing a huge treat, somewhat comparable to an Osamu Tezuka story. The translators also did a great job at making the dialogue have a natural flow to it, which is great because the character interaction is charming and often genuinely funny. The Egyptian atmosphere is nicely complemented by Pepo's tunes, which succeed at giving the game a dynamic action-adventure feeling.<br><br>Graphically, Pharaoh Rebirth would have been impressive even if it came from a team of hard-working sprite artists. However, if Krobon's own Twitter account is any indication, he's responsible for absolutely every bit of pixel art and animation in the game, with Doromizu only having the job of drawing the non-pixelated character art and portraits. As someone who's obsessively into animation, this is particularly impressive to me because this is one of *THOSE* 2D sprite-based games; the kind that, instead of simply doing its job to serve the gameplay, genuinely takes into account the principles of animation to make controlling your character and fighting enemies feel particularly lively. It's not quite on the level of games like Metal Slug 3 or Super Tempo in terms of feeling like you're playing a wonderfully made cartoon (the use of color could use some work, for example), but it's still pretty up there and Krobon is a very high-level sprite artist. The animation and believable physics (shooting tennis balls underwater makes them float to the top!) makes navigating the levels and fighting enemies feel fluid and fun.<br><br>The fact that this game has been out for so long while not being covered at all by the gaming press shows just how little hard work and clever, well-executed ideas matter in the anglosphere's indie gaming scene. Along with Krobon's inability to make connections with indie-clique darlings and journos comes the dreary number of only TWO Metacritic reviews of this game. This unfairness is why I only now decided to point out that there is a shareware, untranslated version of the game out there. Beyond the English script, it lacks the extra stage of the Steam version along with the difficulty settings (and likely other stuff; I only played a tiny bit of the shareware version), but I chose to buy this primarily to support an extremely talented underdog developer who put loads of love, care and effort into creating a charming little adventure that should not be forgotten.<br><br>Also, a little hint: there's an item you can ONLY get from right after the first boss battle by doing a specific thing over and over again. Otherwise, say goodbye to 100% completion.<br><br>===Edit upon completion===<br><br>If you spend a lot of time exploring, you might end up too powerful and the end bosses will be too easy. In order to avoid this, I recommend completing the game and THEN going out of your way to treasure-hunt.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('22414390', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '22414390' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary22414390\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '22414390' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary22414390\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '22414390', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22414390_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary22414390_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21898730\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023348513\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"63082785\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/45ba21785e8311d805ae35012e64e0a01c18f3fc.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/45ba21785e8311d805ae35012e64e0a01c18f3fc.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/45\/45ba21785e8311d805ae35012e64e0a01c18f3fc_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023348513\/\" data-miniprofile=\"63082785\">[blank]<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023348513\/games\/?tab=all\">1,024 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023348513\/recommended\/\">4 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198023348513\/recommended\/441280\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.9 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 17, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWith tight controls, a pretty chill soundtrack, and some really lovely graphics, Pharaoh is definitely something worth picking up.

And yes, bad opening joke for this review. But Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a solid but not spectular game in the metroidvania genre, specifically harking back to the days of the NES with it's specific yet purposeful enemy placement and level designs. There's a good mixture of combat, platforming, and exploration with not too much backtracking, and a good set of systems that complement each other overall. Good variations of level backgrounds, good change of pace gameplay, there's a lot of good, not great here.  There's a bunch of fun to be had here, I just wish that the game was better implemented, with the 360 controller not working for me at all, and resolutions options that aren't really up to par with modern day systems (and not even any options for the full screen entirely. There are also some inconsistencies in the design, as some of the levels have areas that you're just on the cusp on making the jump, only to realize that you just don't have the ability to actually make it. It's no where near a big problem, but it's more of an annoyance that keeps on showing up over and over again, getting a tiny bit more annoying each time. But regardless, it's a good game that's appropriate for it's price point, and is worth your time if you like the genre.<br><br><u> Lists: <\/u><br><b>Positives:<\/b><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Nostalgia takes hold with classic Castlevania (NES) gameplay. Rushing through areas will get your \u2665\u2665\u2665 kick, as enemy placement and damage is purposeful and has a certain rhythm to it.<br><\/li><li> Controls work well in giving the preciseness you need to snipe enemies with your whip-ears while not being too loose for the platforming.<br><\/li><li> Good difficulty ramp as the game isn't brutal, but again, punishes impatience and expects precision. Some good difficult platforming portions that require skill and challenge. <br><\/li><li> Great visual designs complemented with great animation quality. Watching Jonathan eat food in particular was always fun. <br><\/li><li> Secondary weapons provide specific purposes and are very useful when busted out in that right situation.

If you want a Metroidvania in an Order of Ecclesia style (focusing on shorter levels with tigther design over progression systems and exploration), this is it. It feels great to play. There's a lotta room for player expression with subweapon use. Weirdly engaging plot. But it's a bit of a hesitant recommendation. It's definitely worth the normal asking price, though. If you want it, get it whenever.<br><br>Its controls are tight, but not corset-tight (particularly, 1) playing with a joystick causes some awkward hiccups; diagonals are interpreted as 2 keyboard keys; this causes issues with reading signs mid-jump or misalligning shots with a certain weapon, 2) the edges of platforms are almost TOO accurate to the architecture, yet your character's &quot;feet&quot; for determining collision with the ground are smaller than the sprite's). <br><br>The Metroidvania progression feels reeeeally forced and hoakey. These aren't gimmicks that get you to look at levels in new lights; there are obvious barriers to progress to single, empty rooms with singular power up items. If you try to go back each time you get a progress power-up, you'll be disappointed. Only breaking boxes and double jumping give you new, fun challenges.<br><br>The looser Metroidvania structure also hurts it as an action-platformer. It feels as if checkpoint placement wasn't considered in a non-linear fashion; this is most obvious in Stage 4, where the placement of enemies along slow, elevator-like grapple chains assumes a vertical or downward ascent based on an optimal level route that isn't clear until completion.<br><br>The game can be suddenly punishing (mine cart level, ahoy!), especially with its long GAME OVER screen, but the lack of difficulty makes a game bursting with personality play like a vanilla wafer. There are many mechanics which are interesting but never required or dramatically helpful. You get a massive iinvincibility-frame dash, an aerial attack that pushes you back up slightly in the air, etc.--but there are no segments that force you to use the dash or platforming using this unique mechanic. If anything, their use trivializes much of the stage and boss design. You CAN finesse boss fights, but brute-forcing them is just as effective.<br><br>A lot of the bosses have amazing, well thought-out, varied patterns that interact in surprising ways with your arsenal of subweapons... but you can easily just eat 1 carrot per bossfight (makes you invincible for 10+ seconds and ups your attack power), use your i-frame dash to cheese through their attacks that punish you for staying at close range once it wears off, and rush them down. The reward for succesfully figuring out good sub-weapons to use is often not the difference between survival and defeat, but seeing much less of a great boss than it feels you should.<br><br>It's a game that's less than the sum of its parts. But, it's still neat as hell.<br><br>The aesthetics are on point. The music has an emotional breadth while never failing to raise intrigue in cutscenes or keep you pumped up during levels. The sprites are GORGEOUS--please, play this in windowed mode if you can't get this to scale by whole numbers in fullscreen. Some of the use of paralax bakgrounds and varying visual styles among enemies and bakgrounds--it's this wonderful mash of strict depiction and heavy abstraction at once (just see the main character set up against beautiful, lineless backdrops of palm-trees and the ocean's horizon line).<br><br>And there are some real feats of creative game design--particularly, check out how the machine gun interacts with chokepoints in the environment or how much enemy interaction changes once you consider the claymore in stage 4... but much of it is just an unchallenging, decompressed action platformer that saves its flair for boss fights and laaate game optional rooms, leaving a lot of unimpressive downtime.<br><br>Oh, and the story?? Is excellent?? Reminds me of when movies took queues from movies but didn't try to be them--it has punchy little asides between action segments to progress the plot with laugh-out-loud dialogue. Unintrusive and compelling.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24531798', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24531798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24531798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24531798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24531798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24531798', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24531798_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24531798_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary21905139\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060392218\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"100126490\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aaba6074f09c2722113f57cce4f03f7ab3809e00.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aaba6074f09c2722113f57cce4f03f7ab3809e00.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/aa\/aaba6074f09c2722113f57cce4f03f7ab3809e00_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060392218\/\" data-miniprofile=\"100126490\">Gamemusicfreak<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060392218\/games\/?tab=all\">172 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060392218\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060392218\/recommended\/441280\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSimply awesome, period.

After a few seconds the map will fade from the screen.<br><br>The characters and humor are great and I really want to help Jonathan lift the curse and regain his human form.  There's a ton of items and subweapons to collect and fun abilities to gain that will help you get to those hard to reach areas.  The bosses are cool and the dungeons aren't overwhelming, this is Metroidvania done right!<br><br>I searched for somewhere to buy a soundtrack but couldn't find it anywhere.

I expected a well crafted Metroidvania experience going in, but I wasn't expecting this much polish with attention to detail, pacing, and balance.  Heck, even the story is pretty interesting and does a great job crafting very likeable characters.  Really, the only issue I had with it is one single stage in the game that completely changes the formula and comes out of left field.  Luckily, it's only one stage and doesn't overstay it's welcome.<br><br>There's a lot of replay value here too: collecting all the items, sub weapons, power ups, as well as two additional stages after the credits roll.  You can tell this title was a labor of love, and the team deserves praise for crafting something so polished and well developed.<br><br>Highly recommended title.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28955141', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28955141' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28955141\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28955141' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28955141\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28955141', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28955141_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28955141_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28351595\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/virsalus\/recommended\/441280\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"6370300\">Virsalus<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 11.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI do not have time to write up a big review at this point, so I will keep this short.<br><br>For the most part I enjoyed this game.<br><br>The stages feel quite Metroidvania-y, the collectibles (at least most of them) actually give you all kinds of perks so they're not just there for the sake of collecting them. The stages offer a good amount of variety, the bosses are for the most part simple but still fun to fight. <br><br>The soundtrack is really nice. <br><br>The story isn't really deep or anything and the humor seems a bit forced at times, it's still enjoyable though. <br><br>The controls work but they could be a little more refined. Jumping sometimes doesn't feel as responsive as it should be and there really is no reason not to use more buttons than are used. <br><br>You only get a single save slot which for this kind of game and in this day and age is not justifiable.<br><br>What I really dislike about this game is the &quot;car stage&quot; (actually the first part of a stage) which you can't skip on revisits and which you have to do to get some of the collectibles. It's really annoying and doesn't fit in with the rest of the game. <br><br>Other than that, the game is good and I very much recommend giving it a try!<br><br>One more thing, the amount of challenge you'll get out of this depends on the difficulty setting you choose and how much you beef up yourself by getting all the different collectibles. For someone having experience with this kind of game, playing on hard definitely is recommended. You can only choose difficulty when starting a new game, so keep that in mind.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28351595', 'recent_short' );
