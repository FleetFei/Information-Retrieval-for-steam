My initial impressions : The game has great potential. I hope the community doesn't come down too hard on the developer for the current state of the game. Yes, the graphics are pretty basic and the textures are not quite polished, but you have to look beyond that. Having played for a couple of hours now, I see the game has depth, e.g. one of the achievements is to reach 1000 people to unlock new buildings etc, that's pretty intense!<br>Allocation of workers is a bit confusing, I think there needs to be a &quot;professions&quot; menu, because as it stands now you have to highlight every building in order to increase\/decrease workers. One thing I did notice is that workers will only go to jobs closest to their homes if the pay is the same in each profession. Only when I increased the pay scale for a farmer did workers go there.<br><br>The developer has produced a Roadmap of where the game is heading, you can check this out on his website.<br><br>I'm pretty sure the feedback from people who buy the game will help the developer enormously. He has stated his intentions are to make this game the best in its genre. Let's hope so.<br><br>One more thing......when a baby is born, get ready for a loud noise that will make you jump the first time you hear it!<br><br>Finally, give the developer  time guys, I think he has something good here if given the time to fine tune it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28403925', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28403925' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28403925\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28403925' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28403925\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28403925', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28403925_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28403925_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28443562\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NetchFeverfew\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"41298037\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1078f50774789ffbd9bedb46686c13a87334a25d.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1078f50774789ffbd9bedb46686c13a87334a25d.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1078f50774789ffbd9bedb46686c13a87334a25d_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NetchFeverfew\/\" data-miniprofile=\"41298037\">Netch Feverfew<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NetchFeverfew\/games\/?tab=all\">804 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NetchFeverfew\/recommended\/\">14 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NetchFeverfew\/recommended\/538990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">0.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while SugarMill was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 18, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBanished comes to mind when I played this game.<br><br>With Early Access, it feels as such as parts of the game remains incomplete. It is playable to a certain extent with resources being able to be extracted an absolute cinch. There are just a few complaints from me at this very moment. When the game is patched up a bit more, I wiil come back to this review to decide a new score.<br><br>The first complaint has to do with placement of certain buildings, particularly mines. It is quite difficult to discern where a flat terrain starts and a mountaineous region begins. The building rather follows the height of the mountain, making the mine impossible to build even though the required area to be on a flat land is already as such.<br><br>The second complain has to do with land purchasing. It is impossible to buy some lands that have mountains. It is bad enough the tutorial does not explain how to buy land, but buying some hilly land is downright impossible as the signpost is now hidden inside the hill, impossible to be clicked on.<br><br>The third complaint is about the laborer system and work queues in most working buildings. The masonry is used to build almost all the buildings in this game. However, there are sometimes the work queue for certain buildings disappear. If you delete the unbuilt structure, the other unbuilt buildings will appear in the queue. This is especially true for pottery workshops.<br><br>Also, at times, workers in the building will just disappear and appear later in the game. Is this due to the gender of workers?<br><br>The game is playable to an extent. Again, I will return to it at a more patched period for a review.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28443562', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28443562' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary28443562\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28443562' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary28443562\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28443562', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28443562_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary28443562_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/recommended\/538990\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary29107776\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"41923767\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/5493a9846e3f42684731cf460f6993b978b3fbd8.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/5493a9846e3f42684731cf460f6993b978b3fbd8.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/54\/5493a9846e3f42684731cf460f6993b978b3fbd8_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/\" data-miniprofile=\"41923767\">rovaira2<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/games\/?tab=all\">159 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/recommended\/\">41 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198002189495\/recommended\/538990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while SugarMill was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you like games like Tropico 5, Banished, or simulation games you probably will like this. <br><br>This game is early access, so keep that in mind. The graphics have improved since I first posted this review. It's now easier to place a mine, there are now quests in game which make the game a bit more fun, prices now show up on the dock when hitting export, and the game is becoming more enjoyable.<br><br>TIP: To assign workers, there is abutton on the bottom right (looks like pages), click that button, and then assign workers. I found I had to assign more workers to the masonry to get goods moved to and from buildings.<br><br>The gameplay itself is very intriguing so far. It's fun to play. There are many products you can make. You can import, and export via the dock many products as well. There is also a pirate threat one you become more profitable (I haven't gotten this far yet). I believe eventually they plan on adding random maps, or more maps at least, but the starting map they give is a pretty good size. You can expand by buying plots of land on the map as well. <br><br>Children are born, people age, you can click on people and follow them and see what they are carrying as well as details about that person.<br><br>If you're looking to support the developers I'd recommend this game. If you like this genre of games, I'd also recommend it. If you're tight on cash, you could wait for a little sale, or wait for future updates, but it is fun so far for me, and that's the most critical factor for me.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29107776', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29107776' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary29107776\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29107776' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary29107776\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29107776', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29107776_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary29107776_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary28482234\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/brownbaer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"101292532\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13afa8f1039df27087c6299be98cadf370a9ab22.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13afa8f1039df27087c6299be98cadf370a9ab22.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/13\/13afa8f1039df27087c6299be98cadf370a9ab22_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/brownbaer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"101292532\">Octave<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/brownbaer\/games\/?tab=all\">90 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/brownbaer\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/brownbaer\/recommended\/538990\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"early_access_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This review was written while SugarMill was marked as Steam Early Access\">Early Access Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 20, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEdit: here is the review video link, and I will upload part of the transcript as well.<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/upload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/upload<\/a><br><br>Overview<br>Sugarmill is a city simulator with an emphasis on economics and resource management. It is currently available through steam as an Early Access game. The developer is Aatlantis Code, and it was released Dec, 2016.<br>The player starts out with a minimal amount of workers, a fixed amount of resources in storage, and the main goal is to survive and prosper as a community. Threats include: pirates, starvation, exodus, as well other concerns.<br>Though there is a pirate threat, it seems there is no PVP in the game yet, but there are military construction options that act as a sort of deterrent.<br>The game offers unique aspects such as resource expiration (like food spoiling), management of carts and carriages to move supplies, and villagers needing places to live\u2014as well as needing their own specific material goods that will continually eat at your resources.  <br>All those features being said, it is important to note that as of this date many of these features are still in development and need balancing.  <br><br>graphics<br>The graphics host a traditional top-down view of the game similar to other simulation and RTS games. The game does do a good job on presenting perspective in the correct way on building and villagers, and each building seems visually distinct. <br>That being said, the graphics are basic, and textures could use some further attention. If you scroll around the map you can see vast areas of bland greens with some trees.<br>The graphics do the job, they are simple, but there is no confusion on what and where objects are.<br>It would be nice to see some refinement of textures and an ability to zoom further into the village to see small details. One of the aesthetically pleasing aspects is to see the working running around in busy patterns, and being able to focus on these micro patterns would be quite pleasing. <br><br>Sound:<br>The sound needs a lot of work. Volume controls are rough and touchy, the soundtrack volumes vary greatly, and various ambient sounds are loud and off-putting, but all that is forgiven in Early Access.<br>8 One objective concern is the soundtrack itself. On Sugarmill\u2019s website it seems that the music in the game is more than a placeholder, and we may see it as the final product in the game\u2019s soundtrack. The music itself was enjoyable at times, but overall the soundtrack seemed uninspired and bland. There were times where I found myself enjoying the soundtrack, but overall I was not impressed.<br>To me, one thing indie games can do well is the sound. I feel that being small provides a special ability to be flexible with music, and it can really set a game apart from the rest. I feel if this is the music that is going to be used in the final project it is a missed opportunity for the game to set itself apart from its peers. <br>To be clear, I am not calling the music bad in itself, but rather it is not the best fit for this particular game. <br><br>Plot<br>The game takes place during the 16th century during England\u2019s colonial expansion period in the Caribbean. The actual townspeople come from a crashed ship that washed ashore the island, and all the pressure of surviving is on you the leader. There are two options: reconnecting with the Crown or establishing a permanent settlement on the island you find yourself on.  <br>One main goal of the game is to establish a port to allow for imports and exports to allow for your settlement to thrive. This initially takes a long time, and as your port influence increases you receive more clout, and more shipments will come in faster. As your reputation increases, more trade ships will come to support the island.<br>While the main goal is to promote economic prosperity, each advancement your group makes attracts the attention of ever-watching pirates. To deter against this threat your group will develop military outposts and military technologies. <br><br>Gameplay<br>The game uses a combination of macro and micro controls, and means of player influence is dependent strictly on the allocation of workers. You assign workers to various tasks, and they set up the various resources available for the community.<br>This is a top-down strategy game that focuses on building and workflow management, not specific unit control. Think more like the SimCity series as opposed to Age of Empires or Command and Conquer. <br>The focus is on influence, economy, and security. Though you will construct military outposts, weapons, and dedicate units to defense, there is no actual combat in the game. To my understanding, there is a Pirate Threat threshold that, if passed, will result in an automatic game over. <br>The game in its current form does have some obvious bottlenecks. One main area of concern is in resource gathering. Undoubtedly, the game needs to work through to balance the costs and gather rates to make a more fluid system.<br>As for understanding the mechanics, prepare to learn as you go. There is a complete lack of tutorial and online references currently, and information it limited. <br>There were times where I found myself setting the pace to 10x speed (the fastest in the game) and I still was sitting back twiddling my thumbs\u2014waiting for various resources to gather. I believe this is due largely to the Early Access aspect of the game. Hopefully more balancing will come.<br>The amount of gameplay currently available lacks depth, but the core system this game employs is immense. As it sits now, the amount of content available in the gameplay department is very limited, and every player interested in this game needs to weigh that fact heavily when considering purchasing this game.   <br>The Devs have laid out a roadmap for the game, and they state there will be weekly updates on the game every Friday on Steam. The next three major update milestones are set to be December 23rd, Jan 20th, and February 17th. These updates focus on integral components of the game such a balancing, new buildings, and added depth in character mechanics and buildings. A current list can be seen on the game\u2019s website.<br><br>Conclusion\/rating:<br>I played over 10 hours of this game, and I felt I experienced everything it has to offer at its current state. That being said, the development team seems dedicated to listening to its consumer base. I felt encouraged as I played, reporting bugs and making comments was at the forefront of the experience, and as I played the game, it actually had a balancing update. <br>The bottom line: this game is for people that are prepared to have limited gameplay at the moment. Buying this game is more about being involved in the development process, and anyone who has strong passions about the genre may benefit from a purchase. <br>The Steam reviews seem to mostly say the same things: The potential is immense, and the game needs a lot of work in its current state. <br>I give this game a conditional buy status, and anyone interested in the game should consider the scope of the game in Its current state. <br>I hate a great time with this one, and the devs seem passionate about bettering the game. <br><br><br><br>Past Post:<br>Hey, just giving a preliminary outlook. I bought the game today, and so far I am impressed with the mechanics. I am looking forward to doing a full review for the game, and as of right now I would suggest it. I will update this post as I get more hours. Below is a link to some gameplay that is longer than any I\u2019ve seen so far on YouTube.
