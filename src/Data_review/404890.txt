There weren't many so I decided to give it a go myself.  And after playing it for a bit, I think it's been given an unjustly bad rep so far.<br><br>Yes it's a cheap and cheerful game, but what it does it does pretty well.  The sub is fun to control, the different height of your dives and their impact on the game make it diverse and interesting.  It's a fun little action game to play.<br><br>To address some of the criticisms:<br> - That they call going fast a &quot;sprint&quot; and that boats don't sprint.  Technically I agree that sprint probably refers to a human running strictly speaking , but coloquially it's often used as a general term to refer to short bursts of maximum speed (usually at the expense of being able to perform any other function at the same time).  And that's what holding the shift key in gives you - it gives you a short burst of maximum speed during which you can't fire, turn well, etc.  So get over it (the terminology), it's not that bad.  If you want to use the correct nautical terms, play a sailing sim.  &quot;Sprint&quot; very accurately represents its function in this game.<br> - That a sub can outgun a ship using only its deck gun.  Yeah well in CoD you can take 50 bullets over the course of half an hour, and still walk without a limp.  In Skyrim you eat an apple to recover from an axe to the head.  The day we start judging games by their parrels to real life is the day we call all games \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.<br> - That you can't use the mouse.  Yes but you don't need to, it's not a point and click game.  The menus aren't difficult to navigate without.  Game pad support would be welcome, but you can use a mapper such as joycur or antimicro (I tried the latter and it plays really well!).<br> - That the map isn't high res.  I don't think it's supposed to be.  The idea being you're given only basic direction so that navigation is a bit of a challenge (similar to being on a real boat!) and part of the game.  For example there are plenty of shortcuts not shown on the map that you have to work out yourself.<br> - That the sub doesn't control well.  It doesn't control like a car, which is what they seem to be making comparables to.  To be fair it doesn't control like a boat either, but again it's an arcade game not a sim!  I actually like the way it controls.  It feels very fun to play.<br> - Someone mentioned getting annoyed by the sonar beep.  Didn't bother me, it's not very loud.<br> - That the graphics aren't great.  I personally quite like them, I think the whole environment's done pretty well.  If I'd paid \u00a330 I'd be more critical, it's not the best, but it does the job quite well.  I like the water effects and the sub looks cool, so do the ships.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, this isn't an epic.  It is a cheap, fun game.  \u00a34 is probably about right.<br><br>One reviewer said you'd be better off buying Sid Meier's Pirates.  That may be true, but that's a very old game that has been played to death.  It didn't cost \u00a34 when it first came out.  It's also a story\/quest\/RPG\/strategy type game, whereas this is just action and tactics.  Not a fair comparison.<br><br>Some indie games have huge ambitions, and make early access games with massively complex ideas, and none of them end up working very well, and they end up with a shambles of a game that they never actualyl finish.  This on the other hand has done it right IMO.  They've kept it simple, and what they've done they've done well.<br><br> It also has some nice touches like how ships can target you at dive level 1, but planes can't (however if you've recently finished diving the existing fire will still hit you); how the sonar works properly eg it's not a real time display of where the enemies are, it only updates as the scan goes round; you can only dive to level 2 in the deap sea, and can't dive at all when it's really shallow; snow effect when you go to the north east, damage effects when ships\/sub is low on health; the instruments on your HUD getting damaged; you unlock new subs all with different characteristics, of which there is plenty of variety (fuel, oxygen, hull strength, seperate damage speed and ammo count for torpedos, AA, and deck gun).<br><br>I also think they deserve a lot of credit for originality.  While top-down naval shooters have been done before, I'm not aware of any putting a spin on it like this, so the whole controls and fighting is not like any game I've played before.  there are some similar, but the whole sprint, dive 1&amp;2, deck gun, torps, aa mix gives it much more depth to traditional top down shooters.<br><br>I think a star rating on your success on each level (similar to the one in Orcs Must Die and CastleStorm for example), and a difficulty setting would go a long way to increasing its appeal to the more hadcore gamers.<br><br>At the end of the day indie devs are on a budget, they can't throw the resources at it like big company's can.  Whoever's written this has focused on the important things i.e. gameplay; rather than spending there limited resources on in-game music and various refinities it'd benefit from.  I'd like to see more features and more refinement in future, but it's not an early access game, it's fully functional and entertaining as it is now.<br><br>If you have a few hours to kill and a few quid (UK) to spare, you could do a lot worse than this.  I enjoyed it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25329176', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25329176' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25329176\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25329176' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25329176\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25329176', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25329176_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25329176_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/404890\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 7 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["25329176"]}
