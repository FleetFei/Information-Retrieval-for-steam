Where I take the cost of the game and divide by the hours I have played. The very best end up in the cents to hour category, but any game that gets below a dollar an hour I consider money well spent. As of update 1.4 I find the end game flat like many reviewers, once you have a super fleet there is very little that can challenge you. There are some good rebalancing historical mods out there and they are a must after you smash through your first campaign. Graphically the game is rather average with some of the ships having the wrong design from a historical perspective, Yes I am looking at you Brooklyn class light cruiser! The AI is rather flat never adapting but doing the same things over and over, always seeming to be a step behind you. Still there is something great when you have a half hour and you load your campaign up, take your 4 Yamato class battleships and pound an enemy fleet to smithereens. If you are looking for a fun diversion its a good deal for 25 bucks.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30415348', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30415348' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary30415348\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30415348' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary30415348\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30415348', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30415348_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary30415348_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Most Helpful Reviews&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"user_reviews_most_helpful_days\">Overall<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t148 of 186 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">6 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11603360\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"74196682\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/30\/30bd77c44ba65798887de9b42819a217fa751267_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/\" data-miniprofile=\"74196682\">Spirit<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/games\/?tab=all\">865 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/\">61 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/spiritreviews\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pre_release_review tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer last played\/used Victory At Sea on August 8, 2014, which was before it was released.<br><br>This review may not accurately reflect the state of the released version.\">Pre-Release Review<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 8, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer\/publisher!<br><br>I approach the Mili Atoll with my ragtag tin can sailors, weary from submarine hunting and convoy interceptions. This mission is different, however. See, on the Mili Atoll there's a supply port controlled by the Japanese and it's too close to home for comfort. Our admiral has requested that we wrest control in what has become a constant game of island hopping. Success means we'll have some much needed R&amp;R and enough cash to scrape together another ship or two to join our fleet... failure means certain death. With no enemy patrols in sight we launch a night attack. My two destroyers and one submarine escort a dozen or so landing craft full of nervous, young men dead set on taking that beach head at any cost. As we approach an enemy destroyer and cruiser lurches out of port to meet us head on.<br><br>The thunder of war cracks around us and screams fill a previously quiet, still night. Landing crafts explode in plumes of water around us as the cruiser fires the first shots. Their destroyer turns port side and I spot the telltale wake of a torpedo headed my way. My lead destroyer comes into range and opens naval artillery, striking the antagonist destroyer's munitions, causing it to rupture and sink instantly. Alas, I turn too late to avoid the torpedoes and my lead is crippled, floundering in the open. The cruiser and my last destroyer battle it out for minutes, battering one another to near mutual destruction. Finally my submarine enters the fray just in time to strike a killing blow. The port is ours, at a heavy, noobish cost.<br><br>\u201cVictory at Sea\u201d is a naval RTS set in WWII. Assuming you start off in the campaign you'll name your captain and choose his appearance. Then there's a brief, informative series of video tutorials and levels and you're off to do what you'd like. Take ports and slow the spread of the enemy's sphere of influence, stalk supply convoys, or take out the big dreadnoughts that menacingly cruise the seas. You'll have three locations to play in: the Mediterranean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic. You can fight as either the UK or the USA.<br><br>The gameplay is simple enough. You direct your fleet towards, let's say, an enemy fleet on the main world map (which cycles from night to day). You can increases and decrease your ship's speed and the general speed of the game to get to the location as fast as you'd like. Once you hit your target you'll see a series of minuses or pluses that indicates their strength to yours. Choose to engage and you'll decide which ships you want to battle with and enter the tactical map. There you'll see your ships and the enemy fleet. You can switch between the tactical overhead map and a ship level map. You'll be able to manually control your ships or let them go on autopilot (I recommend micromanaging. You can pause the combat and switch quickly enough between your ships to give them orders, aim your shots, maneuver, etc.). You'll see your health displayed, the statuses of equipment and weapons, crew, and captain. When you see an enemy target you'll see a series of minuses or pluses that indicates their strength to yours.<br><br>Each ship type has different combat options. Subs for instance can submerge and fire torpedoes relatively quickly from aft or bow, but they move slowly. Destroyers move faster but can only fire torpedoes off port or starboard side with a slower reload time (though their main guns have great range and reload quickly). Aircraft carriers launch planes to harass enemies and move at a snail's pace. And battleships... battleships are just really cool, floating fortresses of doom.There are a lot of ships to choose from, and choosing the right ship loadout for combat scenarios can really make a difference. As you kill, capture and sail you'll accrue experience. That experience increases your captain's level, unlocks ships, and earns you war bonds to spend on new ships... or to salvage ones you've lost.<br><br>So that's the campaign for you, but there's two other modes. Historical mode lets you fight out actual naval battles, allowing you to maintain the current timeline or alter history and create ROBO-HITLER YOU JERK. There's also a point battle mode that allots you a set number of points to spend on vessels for two combatants; choose a side and fight it out.<br><br>\u201cVictory at Sea\u201d is very fun. Choosing your battles, taking out enemy ports, watching the map turn in your favor as flags are hoisted over friendly ports, and unlocking cooler, more powerful vessels to wage war is all very rewarding. But there are some flaws to note. Graphically it isn't going to raise any eyebrows \u2013 and I know, graphics really aren't all that important when you're playing an RTS. But ships will take direct hits and you'll see a little explosion, some smoke, and nothing else. There doesn't appear to be any gradual damage. Sometimes a little fire will break out but that's about it. And when a ship sinks it just sort of floats down. Don't expect any cool Titanic-esque sinking in \u201cVictory at Sea.\u201d There isn't any multiplayer currently (though the devs seem interested in possibly implementing it). At the moment there are only six historical battles (devs say they intend to add more). And the 25 dollar price tag is a bit steep, especially with similar titles like \u201cBattlestations: Pacific\u201d going for nine. <br><br>So does \u201cVictory at Sea\u201d sink or swim? I say it swims. Maybe not a strong enough swimmer to cross the English Channel, but a swimmer nonetheless. It isn't breaking the mold and it isn't flashy but it's fun to play \u2013 and that's what counts. If you have any doubts just wait and see what support the devs give it. Otherwise dive right in. And take out that frickin' OP Bismark.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11603360', 'summary' );

school of gaming,but I am a guy who wants fun,not frustration.<br><br>Lots and lots of ship classes,makes and models.Has ships from not just GB,the U.S.,Germany,and Japan,but also from France and Italy.Grognards take heed:some ships do not live up to their real life inspirations,e.g.: the Le Fantasque class of destroyers had been almost light cruisers,they had been truly dangerous yet in the game they seem to have been de-fanged.<br><br>Has missions to complete but one can play a campaign( Pacific,Mediterranean,or Atlantic) in a open enviroment.You do not have to wait for orders to attack an enemy base or go cruising for supply convoys to pick off.<br><br>Young:Just released and still kinda like a beta game,they just made the IJN playable.Some of you may find that bad but,the game has lots of room to grow.The Kriegsmarine will be playable soon.How soon,I cannot say.Hopefully the Regia Marina,and the Vichy and Free French will become playable as well,they should. . . . . the Italians and French made the sexiest ships of WW2.<br><br>CONS: Glitchy,saving your game does not always mean it will save.Very frustrating having to fight the same battle twice.<br><br>Lack of content.See above under young.<br><br>Grinding exp and funds gets old real fast.Hard to make money when you only have 4 destroyers,and your boss tells you to go out and intercept the damned Admiral Hipper,which can destroy all of your puny tin cans with their pop-guns all by itself from stand-off range.<br><br>So to wrap this prelimanary review up:easy to get into,very fun,longevity(not even close to finishing a campaign yet) but also frustrating at times and feels unfinished.<br><br>FINAL SCORE(as of now): 93% positive,very reccomended.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('12810087', 'summary' );

There's two sides to the gameplay, in campaign you manage your fleet, you build ships, attack ports, raid convoys, and such on the campaign map all in real time. Once two fleets clash you then pick out the ships you want to fight with and ones you want to keep in reserve and duke it out as an RTS. <br><br>In the tactical battles, you can issue orders with the tactical view, and command a ship personally aiming weapons and steering it about. The orders themselves are pretty simple, you can order a ship to move, attack, defend, or retreat. The main thing about your ships is the varitiy and the modling of the different weapons on board. The game features, destroyers, various crusiers, battleships, carriers, and submarines, in along with some minor patrol and convoy ships. All of these ships have different subsystems in place modling the damage to the weapons and other departments of the ship. In the images above, the green central buttons are the weapons and the little icons below them are all the different subsystems that can be hit. <br><br>I see Victory At Sea being a very ambitous game. I haven't had the chance to push through too much of the campaign so I'll just say that it looks highly promising. The game delivers not only one but three campaigns, one pacific, one atlantic, and a mediterranean one aswell. The game features seven different nations, though a couple such as free and vichy france aren't too fleshed out. I like the faster pacing to Victory At Sea though I can see it being a tad simplistic and too fast for someone looking for more of a simulator experience. <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Pk4Ln7cOTXU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Check out my gameplay video for more infomation on Victory At Sea<\/a><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11566874', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11566874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11566874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11566874' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11566874\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11566874', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11566874_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11566874_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t51 of 64 people (80%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary14493996\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cannonesshannah\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"59068736\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d98636e2622964646e3f145787f72992ba19136.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d98636e2622964646e3f145787f72992ba19136.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/3d\/3d98636e2622964646e3f145787f72992ba19136_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cannonesshannah\/\" data-miniprofile=\"59068736\">Katie's Hannah<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cannonesshannah\/games\/?tab=all\">1,020 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cannonesshannah\/recommended\/\">75 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/cannonesshannah\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">13.3 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Recommended<\/b>: While it feels that there could be more to Victory at Sea, if you're complaining that the game is fun and you want more of it, its not a bad complaint.  It combines an interesting mission-based overworld with a highly-positional tactical battle view that I found rather compelling.  My two big complaints would be that the UI could use some streamlining in places, and that some people may find the simplicity of the guns modelled a bit off-putting, but I found the game a good bit of fun and challenge in equal measure.<br><br>Read the full review <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.highlandarrow.com\/reviews\/183-review-victory-at-sea.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >here<\/a>.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14493996', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14493996' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14493996\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14493996' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14493996\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14493996', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14493996_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14493996_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17821015\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerivon\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"36746125\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd8abd69f99bbbedc265a3dd78d88bf2869de9f.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd8abd69f99bbbedc265a3dd78d88bf2869de9f.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/bb\/bbd8abd69f99bbbedc265a3dd78d88bf2869de9f_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerivon\/\" data-miniprofile=\"36746125\">Nerivon<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerivon\/games\/?tab=all\">267 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerivon\/recommended\/\">5 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/nerivon\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">10.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 31, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirstly.

This one still earns my praise for trying, if in a very sloppy manner. <br><br><b>Pros:<\/b><br>- <b>Combat<\/b>: Loving how you have to aim &amp; guess where your shots shall fall. It's satisfying when you damage &amp; sink vessels.<br>- <b>Combat - Extra<\/b>: The ability to create a smoke screen with the ship's funnels, to create convoys, to be all tactical with submarines, and etc. Even the whole ability by using landing crafts to capture ports.<br>- <b>AI &amp; Ship command<\/b>: I love the ability to set the AI on auto-pilot or to take command of specific ones. You can set waypoints &amp; even personally command any vessel on command. It's sweet &lt;3<br>- <b>Hardpoints<\/b>: What I absolutely love about VAS is the whole hardpoint feature with you able to cripple vessels in specific manners. The ability to aim for their turrets, to slay sailors, and etc. <br>- <b>World map:<\/b> is free-roamy, meaning you can travel anywhere.<br>- <b>Factions<\/b>: UK, Kriegsmarine, Italy, Japan &amp; USA. Nice variety, yet needs far more in campaign. I love how New Zealand &amp; Canada found their way into the UK, yet wishing they were their own mini-faction regradless of their size &amp; value in other people's eyes.<br>- <b>Repairs<\/b>: Having to repair back at docks and to resupplyl.<br>- <b>Ports<\/b>: Having to capture them like flags to then purchase new vessels. Even having to use troop transports to take over enemy types while defending your own transports; Sinking the assaulting.<br>- <b>Reinforcements<\/b>: Nice concept here that needs to be fleshed out more in combat. Nearby fleets join in to attack or defend you. Minus convoys.<br>- <b>Modding<\/b>: I respect the developers for trying to make this game modable with various ways to insert different ship types, stats &amp; faction stuff. <br><br>=<br><br><b>Cons:<\/b><br>- <b>Repetition<\/b>: Quickly becomes &quot;same&quot; formula. <br>- <b>AI needs work <\/b>: AI at times is neat, yet at other times it's highly horrible. It's eager to team-kill just to sink the other enemy. It does silly things when you're not at the helm.<br>- <b>Go big, or go home<\/b>: Becomes harder to bring in smaller vessels that you have to think like a younger individual to simply bring in purely battleships &amp; aircraft carriers to win late-game. Granted, it may be more rewarding at higher levels when other features kicks in.<br>- <b>Ports<\/b>: They're all the same with them needing to be personalized when you go to dock into them. The assault\/defend battle maps needs actual landmass in variety &amp; actual detail. More ports, more variety.<br>- <b>Map types<\/b>: I'm aware this is naval with water, yet there's still a way to add in ice maps, port haps, harbour maps, and various other sorts. More variety needed.<br>- <b>Missing various ship types<\/b>: Going through the forums I noticed ships were still missing from the game. I even notice missing Canadian vessels, such as the Minatour &amp; the three Prince Robert\/Henry\/ David vessels. Germany, UK, &amp; Japan all missing their fair-share also. Granted, this all takes loads of work to put into it. <br>- <b>Modding<\/b>: Still missing mod support on the side of a map-maker, world maker, Model importing &amp; etc. This game could be so much better with it.<br>- <b>Camera<\/b>: Absolutely introverted. It wants to push you away by forcing you into the tactical map itself with grids. It doesn't want you anywhere near the units, or even to look-up to see far. It wants you to be &quot;cross-eyed&quot; with how awkward it is. This hurts when viewing smaller units &amp; when trying to aim.<br>- <b>Hardpoint Lock<\/b>: No way you can swap the hardpoints to make the vessels personalized to you &amp; your situation. You're stuck with the default, unless you mod it.<br><br>=<br><br>This game has so much potential, yet it's dragging its feet too heavily that it's sitting still in open waters. It can easily be highly engaging &amp; rewarding, yet the developers are too focused on too many things to make this game overly epic. I genuinely enjoy it for the features it has added, how much fun one can get out of it, and all the stuff it's missing. RIght now I still view it as 70-80% complete product needing to add Russia, missing units, other countries, and even the promised multiplayer. <br><br>I do recommend this to people, but only on the part that I want other game developers to stop being fearful of producing open-world naval games. Make more VAS, more Silent Hunter, and other sorts of games. Cash in on KanColle &amp; Arpeggio of Blue Steel anime hype. People may say they're sick of war-games, yet they're seeking specific ones that actually matter by hitting actual sweet spots. How I would love to take command of the Canadian &amp; Dutch navy, no matter how you may view their worth in the war. Tribute is tribute; Learning about history is what peaked my interest with this game. I learned some neat stuff from KanColle web game &amp; this game, thus my slight bias nudging this game rating above &quot;average&quot;<br><br>I rate this 70-80% of 100% (or 7 to 8 of 10) for it's sluggish &amp; incomplete, yet well researched product. I also praise this game because it's not only about USA, but about the whole world.

You start off with but a single destroyer, but as you complete missions, harass enemy convoys and sink subs, you slowly gain experience points.<br>These are then used to unlock different classes of ships, and during missions you earn vital war bonds. These are then used to acquire more vessels and expand you fleet.<br>The game has a brilliant selection ranging from destroyers, cruisers, patrol boats, carriers, battleships, subs, and even convoy ships.<br><br>The campaign is fairly simple, and so are the missions, but things slowly become more difficult and your tactics become extremely important. <br>You have the ability to simply control your flagship and let the AI handle the rest of your fleet, but opening up tactical mode brings up a grid based top down view. Something rather essential for large fleet encounters. Issue orders, set waypoints, determine fire arcs. You do all this from there, while the game is paused. <br>Pressing spacebar resumes gameplay, but you can press it again to pause and issue orders, choose which ships are AI controlled or which you manually want to manoeuvre. <br><br>The gameplay is fantastic, it\u2019s rare to get a naval strategy game and the developers are rather ambitious. Although so far I\u2019ve been greatly impressed.<br><br>Moving towards Historical battles, it simply is what the name suggests. Although on a smaller scale sadly. Whether this is due to engine limitations or simply because the content has not been fully implemented at the time of covering the game; it wasn\u2019t actually too much of an issue.<br>There\u2019s something epic about taking part in sinking the Bismarck.<br><br>The visuals aren\u2019t stellar, although the ship models are well done and have good detail. The only time you\u2019ll say otherwise is if you happen to fully zoom in right against the side of the ship. Although if you\u2019ll have the time to bother with that during full combat is up to you. <br>The fact that the majority of the game world is covered in water helps, as it cuts down on lots of extra rendering, meaning it should be easier for older systems to run.<br><br>The sound effects, now those are Loud, and powerful. Having the Hood and Bismarck go at it with headphones on might be a mistake as those guns and explosions can be deafening. It certainly sounds amazing!<br><br>Sadly I\u2019m a terrible captain, easily failing at the campaign for forgetting that the more plusses\/stars on an enemy fleet the more dangerous they are. I\u2019ve often lost my ships against a measly german patrol for not paying attention, and forgetting you can pause the game with spacebar to issue commands. You can\u2019t just play this like a normal RTS, you have to constantly pay attention.<br><br>Ship modules can be damaged, and although some can get repaired by you crew, severe damage means you need to return to a port for proper repairs and outfitting. A nice addition to the game, which keeps you on your toes.<br><br>I\u2019ve not done well in the campaign, but I really enjoy Victory at Sea. It\u2019s certainly a game I\u2019ll go back to again, and again. It\u2019s shaping up to be something fantastic.<br><br>First impression video<br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/M3hWAxtCjyo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/M3hWAxtCjyo<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11599337', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11599337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11599337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11599337' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11599337\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11599337', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11599337_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11599337_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17057074\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019543617\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"59277889\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/65b07152e9947aef0aec7f47da11e1a8f49ef6ed.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/65b07152e9947aef0aec7f47da11e1a8f49ef6ed.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/65\/65b07152e9947aef0aec7f47da11e1a8f49ef6ed_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019543617\/\" data-miniprofile=\"59277889\">GEM<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019543617\/games\/?tab=all\">203 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019543617\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198019543617\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">46.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: July 15, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere isn't many WW2 naval games out there - which is a pity.

You can find this game somewhere in the realm of 5-10$ which is definitly worth it.  <br><br>The fun is definitly aquiring a nice big fleet of ships over time and taking the fight to various enemies about the map and pushing your side to victory.  Its very much like &quot;mount and blade&quot; in that sense. I like the freedom of floating about looking for ships or ports, and its not just scripted chain of events or battles.  I think it works very well for these type of games.<br><br>The biggest anoyance though is the attrocious AI, they can somewhat shoot but you can manually click shoot way more accurate, it would take you a minute to sink what would take the AI 3-5 minutes. But the  bigger issue is the torpedo avoidance.  If you want to loose a good number of ships, then by all means use the AI.  Any time ships fire torpedos you need to manually adjust course and wait till they are clear before putting AI back on because inevitably they will steer the ships right back into them for some stupid reason.  Look at it more like total war games where you can battle or auto resolve.  If you battle you might loose 5% to an easy enemy, if you auto resolve your going to loose about 30-40%.  Same idea just AI or manual control everything (which does become tiring)<br><br>Theres a bit too much arcade to this, hit points, vague differences in what appear to be the same outfitting but on an entirely different ship for a different price. Some other much needed things, auto sinking convoys once all escorts are sunk, just annoying to mop them up Port assaults too are quite garbage feeling and feels like it needs a complete rework or just toss it in the bin and let it be captured when theres no support left and theres no fleets nearby.<br><br>It could also be greatly expanded in the support and supplies area as opposed to random convoys moving about.  Actually make supplies mean something to strive for and give way to help support and move convoys along or actual patrol options.  i dont know, theres many possibilities. <br><br>If this company continues to develop games along this line and adds a good bump to realism, and more depth and AI mechanics, immersion, etc, then it would definitly be a must buy on my list.  <br><br>Dont let the negatives steer you away, For what the game is, its fun, and simple enough and it feels like a good base that could turn into something much more fun if the idea is further developed.<br><br>Again for the 5 to 10$ you can find it for, its definitly worth it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29135618', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29135618' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29135618\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29135618' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29135618\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29135618', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29135618_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29135618_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29002291\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971234737\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"10969009\">H5N1<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 230.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSea warfare has always been pretty difficult to put into a game format; a bit like flight simulators, they can either be too arcadey (and therefore not really do justice to their subject) or too realistic (hanging around for hours in a sub with nothing but little wheels to turn).  Given the vast distances involved in WW2 sea combat, where opposing fleets in the age of air power sometimes never saw each other directly during battle, Victory at Sea makes some quite good compromises.  So, for example, the ocean scale is reduced so that even when you have an overwhelming carrier force it's still useful (and fun) to have a few battleships to take out some of the nearby enemy in between air strikes.  Lobbing your shots over thousands of yards, anticipating where your target will be when they fall, is a skill you'll enjoy developing.  It's more arcade than sim, but fun.<br><br>Graphically the game isn't up there with the best (but it's perfectly adequate for the job) - since even with a fair PC you get some lag once all planes and ships are in view later in the game when 80+ ships can be involved in battles, that's probably just as well.  Carrier air groups are representative rather than historically accurate for the same reason (an Essex class carrier here has 9 aircraft, rather than the 90 of real life), but that works well in terms of balanced ship v ship action.<br><br>New units are unlocked as you progress in experience; defeating enemies earns you War Bonds to buy different ships, and there are quite a few models within each class - destroyer, cruiser, battleship, for example - each with different features; however, once you've maxed out at skill level 10 you'll find that you won't bother with most - some within a class are just so superior that there isn't much point keeping or buying others.  So, for example, playing as the US I always end up with Iowa class battleships (only a Yamato outranges them), Essex Class carriers, and Fletcher class destroyers - nothing else.<br><br>As others have said, many of the missions are same-y; capturing a port is routine to the extent that once you have a competent, balanced fleet you can just leave it to the AI to capture them if you don't mind taking a few more casualties, which are easily replaced (if you lose a ship you don't lose the captain and his experience).  It gets to the point that you just sail around on the vast ocean (in map mode) for ten to fifteen minutes waiting for one of the invasion challenges to pop up, which involves your dashing over to defeat a fleet typically two to three times larger than yours before it captures one of your ports (there is a way of defeating an 80+ fleet with your limit of 20 units per engagement, but I'll let you find that out for yourself).  Put together, this makes for low replayability; typically, I'll play it for a week, end up with a fleet of 80+ including 60 carriers (as I say, more arcade than historically accurate), delete it, then come back six months or more later.<br><br>But the real problem with this game is the AI, which lets the whole thing down.  Leaving aside the enemy's &quot;charge straight at 'em every time&quot; fleet formations and willingness to allow lone puny destroyers to wander into the range of your big guns long before the rest of his main body can punch you back, it's your own AI support which really sucks.  For the game to be fun, you want manual control of some units while leaving others under AI but executing your tactical battle plan (as with admirals and captains in real life) - so, for example, I want to bring my battleships to the fringes of engagements under my control to catch enemy ships with my guns, while my carriers stand off and pick off priority targets, wear down their air groups etc, maintaining formation and distance from the enemy as they do so.  <br><br>Fat chance - it's total manual (too fiddly, constant pausing to see what's going on with every ship, or all AI - nothing in between.  Put your carriers under AI control, take your six battleships up to the enemy to have a bit of fun, turn around three minutes later and the carriers are all over the shop and heading in different directions, sending aircraft to their own idea of a priority target - which often lies right at the far side of the enemy fleet, meaning that you lose half your aircraft to shipboard AA fire as they overfly it straight away.  Meanwhile, one of your battleships has been disabled and you need air to take out the Yamato class brute which is going to sink it - but your carrier captains have their own agenda, and by the time you have taken them back under manual control it's too late.  They also like sending out every single one of their fighters to shoot down a few enemy seaplanes when you've already wiped out the enemy fighter cover to allow your bombers in, so they all get shot down by the ships for nothing.<br><br>If anything it gets worse when your whole fleet is under manual control.  You can create groups, but they are so poorly designed that they are useless.  For example, every battleship fleet commander since before Nelson has dreamed of &quot;crossing the T&quot;, bringing his ships in line across the head of the enemy's column, allowing each ship to fire broadside on at a single target at a time, which cannot reply with its full armament; so you need to keep your ships in line, evenly spaced.  Absolutely standard naval practice, which captains would rehearse over and over again.  Not your captains, though.  You want it, you have to fiddle with every ship individually - all of the time; bearing, speed, distance, the lot.  Not only difficult, but tiresome.  I'm an admiral, for goodness' sake; what a shower my captains are.  <br><br>Worse yet: you place your precious carriers in two well spaced lines, set their speed (individually, arghh), group select their bearing, and send them off to keep distance from the enemy.  Five minutes later one of them is being sunk - whaaa?  What happened?  What happened is that one of your brilliant experience level 10 captains bumped into another, bounced off at an angle, hit another, ditto, ended up sailing straight towards the enemy, bang.  <br><br>And finally, when you do have them all in the right place and sailing in the right direction again, if you want them to attack your own choice of target you have to select every single carrier, plane, and target individually - so, if you have 16 carriers and want to dive bomb the Musashi, that's one click per carrier, one click per dive bomber (six per ship), one click per target per carrier.  That's 128 clicks.  Select all (or groups) of carriers, all planes of a type, and target,  and get your captains to do the rest?  Apparently admirals can't do that, don't be silly.  (Yes, you can order entire groups to attack a target in map mode - but then they will send off every aircraft and type, leaving nothing in reserve, and manoeuvre to where you don't want them; and 100% losses are common among torpedo bombers unless you've already taken care of their CAP).<br><br>Come on, Evil Twin; this is basic stuff which has existed in other games for decades - set and maintain unit formation and speed, set stance to aggressive, reactive, keep distance etc, deploy only some weapons, prioritise target types.  More to the point, it's basic naval warfare - it's why every ship has a captain: to fight his ship while executing the strategic and tactical orders of his fleet commander, not bugger off bumping into everything and kamikaze-ing his air group at every opportunity.  Court martials all round.<br><br>In the end this flaw prevents you from getting a lot more out of the game; it means you cannot set complex traps based on multiple elements of your fleet operating independently but under your overall control and to your plan.  <br><br>This is therefore one of those games to buy at \u00a33.99 or so; I would need a lot of persuading to buy a Victory at Sea 2 at even a tenner unless Evil Twin addresses these basic flaws.  So recommended, yes - at a low price.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29002291', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29002291' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29002291\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29002291' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29002291\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29002291', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29002291_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29002291_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28728637\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198177724395\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"217458667\">Colonal Otter<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 29.4 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 27, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t     When I was activly into this game it was tough to put down.  It's one of those &quot;one more battle and I'll go to bed \/ whatever you have to get done&quot; and an hour goes by but you're still playing.  Your fleet gradually expands\/upgrades as you grind money from sinking enemy ships travelling about the map.  The campaings are thus very free-roam and at your own pace, since you choose your targets and can tackle side-quests.  <br>     <br>     Only thing is, I wouldn't recommend at the full $20 (the price might have gone down by now but I haven't checked), I didn't find it THAT amazing (it's not a super sophisitcaed naval combat game like the BATTLESTATIONS franchise or anything like that, simple vehicle models too).  I recommend if you can get it on sale, even just a few dollars off, and if you're into naval combat gaming\/naval strategy.  You can zoom in on the battle after setting up your fleet's battle formation for each engagment, changing the view from a top down to the blue grid to a 3d view of the battle, where your camera can track a specific ship or free roam.  All units including planes are commanded by point and click; when you take control of a ship you can aim its weapons instead of the AI.  <br><br>     I would describe the combat more as a live-time battleship boardgame match where you see the enemies ships rather than say a BATTLESTATIONS game or war thunder; this game is more simplistic and strategy based.  Singleplayer only, no mutiplayer.  One last complaint is the ships are VERY short range, it's not emphaisized on realism where ships engage from miles away.  It's more like a few hundred feet.  I recommened if you're either REALLY into naval games, or you Like naval combat And you can get it on sale.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28728637', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '28728637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short28728637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '28728637' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short28728637\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '28728637', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28728637_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short28728637_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28547554\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198007789836\/recommended\/298480\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"47524108\">mjones333<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 41.2 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 22, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA really excellent game system that combines a strategic and tactical approach to World War Two with the opportunity to fight with the great ships of the navies.

Its got a big arcade bent which makes it very easy to pick up and play. <br>There are tons of ships to choose from and several campaigns.<br>As long as you dont get to serious or think to hard it really is great fun. <br><br>Problem is the campaign quickly becomes monotonous. And as your fleet grows as does the fun of micro managing your ships. It just becomes a slugging match between the battleships.<br>Game also feels more a clash of stats than ship designers and crews. Certainly in the british fleet - one of hugely varied harware never feels weak or strong.
