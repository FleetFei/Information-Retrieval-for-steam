Always Be Closing.&quot;<br><br>If it weren't for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >that one scene<\/a> with Alec Baldwin, I probably would've never heard of this film. Even though much of what his character claims can be <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MehvWs5B7J0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >refuted<\/a> in the face of newly developed sales strategies, nothing alters the true impact that both the audience and the surrounding characters feel during those first 15 minutes. A change in motivation for said characters isn't easily accomplished by one mere speech though, and with everyone's job on the line in spite of all the years they've worked at the agency, things get a bit stingy in the Big Apple.<br><br>Being a faithful recreation of the play, Glengarry GlenRoss dedicates much of its time to the characters and their reactions to the conflicts that arise in the film. And as expected, the main cast conveys these emotions flawlessly, with every line of dialogue hinting at something relevant and meaningful to the film. Jack Lemmon goes above and beyond in his portrayal of Shelley Levene, and truly shines when conversing with Kevin Spacey's character, where we get to feel Levine's innate desperation to protect his job at any cost and regain his pride as a salesman.<br><br>Much of the underlying subtext is brilliant as well; at the conclusion of the &quot;closing&quot; scene, Baldwin's character walks back into the main office with the camera positioned in a way that emphasizes the &quot;Salesmen are born, not made&quot; banner above the office window. That message comes largely into play later, and can arguably explain why the characters in the office didn't exactly heed Baldwin's advice. The thunder &amp; lightning in the first half also does justice in escalating narrative tension, notably in Dave Moss's monologues about his attitude towards Mitch &amp; Murray (Owners of real estate agency that sent Baldwin's character to &quot;motivate&quot; the salesmen), and almost all of the scenes with Jack Lemmon.<br><br>Jack Howard Newton is an unknown name to me as far as the music department goes, but when music does play, it captures the noir-rich atmosphere of the film's setting just right, with New York-style saxophones &amp; bass guitars dominating the score. My only gripe is that the guitar was a little hard to hear during Al Pacino's scenes in the second half; I didn't like how his voice kept drowning it out, but that's probably just me.<br><br>On behalf of the estimated <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.the-numbers.com\/movie\/Glengarry-Glen-Ross#tab=summary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" >$1,775,000<\/a> that the filmmakers lost during theatrical release, it's safe to say that Glengarry GlenRoss isn't for everyone, regardless of the film's all-star cast. Sales jargon is practically omnipresent, so talk of &quot;leads&quot; and &quot;pipelines&quot; can easily throw off viewers whom aren't acquainted with the jargon beforehand. No marketing research required, but this is definitely one of those &quot;Ah schucks, I've gotta watch this turkey again to understand it better&quot; movies.<br><br>All in all, Glengarry GlenRoss is a cinematic classic, and a film I recommend to anyone who loves movies with great characters, well written dialogue, and A-list actors.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26049990', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26049990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26049990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26049990' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26049990\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26049990', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26049990_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26049990_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/506230\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["26049990"]}
