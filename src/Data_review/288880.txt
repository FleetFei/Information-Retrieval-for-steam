I don't see anyone complaining about Slender games and having to collect pages in the middle of nowhere. Like that actually makes sense. But in this game. Collecting keys actually does make sense. Because it's for a good reason. Imagine if you had a whole mansion where you can freeroam in the dark, no lights and looking for clues. You will probably get lost, frustrated and quit.. But this game was built this way, because something in that house wants you to find certain keys on a certain days.<br><br>Pineview drive takes place in an old abandoned mansion. 20 years ago a man and his wife Linda stayed at the mansion until one night she just vanished. And ever since, no one has been able to stay there for more than 30 days. No one was able to find any clues or anything related to her disappearence.  So they just locked it. 20 years later, you will come back as the man, to find out what happened to her and hopefully be at peace.<br><br>Once you go inside the mansion, the clock will start ticking. The sun will start going down. So you have a really short time to look around for a clue before it becomes pitch black, literally. You will not be able to see anything apart from the key in your inventory. That you need to find its matching door. So your first task is to find a flashlight. After that you have to find a clue which consists of a page from a diary about Linda that you need to collect everyday in order to make it to the next day where the game will save automatically. And every page will bring you closer to the truth of what happened to her. <br>The game starts off at a slow pace, a bit calm and confusing. Very frustrating also as you can never find the keys. Which I believe why people gave it a thumb down. But as you progress, the game becomes darker, shorter days, more secrets, more scares plus the mansion becomes bigger as you unlock more of it which makes it so tiring and creepy to go back and fourth looking for keys and clues. Although you will not find any key until whatever is in that house wants you to find it.<br><br>Almost all recent horror games are the same and cliche. Throwing jumpscares at you at every corner so deperate to scare you. Pineview drive is far from that! You can never guess when and what will scare you and how. You can literally go in a room hundred times then when you go back one more time, the door will disappear, and you could hear someone say &quot;PSSST!&quot; your character will gasp and jump making you crap your pants as well. Or walk along the hallway, and suddenly the lights will start flickering. Objects and statues changing their position and coming to life. Like a cat statue disappearing then you can hear it yowl around the house and coming out when you least expect it. Walking around a hallway million times, then suddenly you find a clown toy sitting on a chair. The scarecrow following you and watching you through the windows. Linda ringing the door bell and you can see her figure through the door glass. Or locking you up in a room, seeing her through the window swinging, her coming out of the TV, or making you play chess with her. And after each event, she will leave you a key that will unlock more rooms for you to explore. Now imagine doing all of that in pitch black, dying flash light and horrifying sounds.<br>Once you collect 26 pages. The last 4 days are put into 1 night. Where you need to collect 4 pieces of a picture in the last room in the mansion, that has the real secret behind what happened. Was a shocker I must say. And from there it will ask you to go to the cemetery to find Linda's grave. That will take you underground where it will get even more scarier.<br><br>I'm a horror games maniac since a very very long time. I had a blast playing Outlast. But in this game, I couldn't make it through the fist day. I had 1 hour on record of me quitting on the same day at the same spot. I was lost so I decided to watch a playthrough and ended up watching the whole game, and really considered uninstalling it because if it made a big grown up man scream more girlier than me, than I'd probably die from a shock. But I changed my mind, and gave it ago. I made it to day 7. But gonna take a long break before I go back to it.<br><br>This is the most underrated horror title in history of video games. Very atmospheric, no bugs, perfectely written and designed, and most probably one of the best jumpscares ever. If you're gonna give it a thumb down then it should be for being too scary you won't be able to able it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17863119', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17863119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17863119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17863119' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17863119\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17863119', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17863119_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17863119_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t72 of 85 people (85%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary11560267\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f3\/f38e51f3b39081842f2405f6a312c42a55fc80a2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/\" data-miniprofile=\"79164572\">AestheticGamer<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/games\/?tab=all\">5,088 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/\">72 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/AestheticGamer\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">7.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPineview Drive is an indie haunted house simulator with relatively simple gameplay. Over the span of 30 days, you try and find clues to what happened to your wife, Linda, who disappeared without a trace at an old abandoned estate 20 years ago, for your own closure. To accomplish this you must look around the house, find keys, open doors, and experience a variety of scares and spooks.<br><br>And let me restate this point: This game is a haunted house simulator. It's with these expectations that I think the game is best experienced. It's done in a similar vein to the Ju-On The Curse game or the Haunted House mode in the Fatal Frame 2 Wii Remake. Nothing is coming to attack you, there is no hiding mechanic, no enemies to shoot and kill. Your character is slow, can't jump, and gameplay consists of looking for keys\/matches\/batteries\/notes\/locked doors, and experiencing events.<br><br>On this accord, it does some smart things. Your character does have health even though you're not attacked directly, the health instead is basically responsive to how you react when 'scared' When a scare happens, if you do something with your controls, IE starts shaking your mouse around or suddenly start running or stop running or stop altogether, basically changing the pace of movement you were doing when the scare happens, you'll lose health. How much health you lose is accordant to how extreme\/timely your reaction is. This also is all monitored to take note of what you react strongly too and don't and stores that information away to change some minor events. It works well for the most part, though I noticed the game seemingly thinking I was scared of certain events that didn't scare me.<br><br>And in my opinion the game works, mainly due to the fact the atmosphere of the game is good and some of the scares did legitimately scare the crap out of me. Scares are subjective, but most games don't scare me, so when one game manages to scare me a few times over the course of the game, I take notice. The atmosphere helps a lot towards this, the rooms look appropriately creepy, the music has good variety and can be good to make you unnerved, along with the type of music you sometimes question if the music is the background music or something happening. The game starts off rather slow with little happening, but escalates as the days go on.<br><br>Some scares and moments are obviously inspired by other things however. They're still effective, but can take away from the moment if you recognize the scare's obvious inspiration. Without spoiling too much, there were two scenes that were very obviously inspired by the film, &quot;Ringu&quot;, and the game, &quot;Condemned: Criminal Origins.&quot; And not all scares were winners, many either left me unphased and some were a bit silly.<br><br>On the flip-side, there was some very unique scares in places and some were handled well, and there's a good variety. There's even a few scares and entities that are randomized and can happen anywhere later in the game as you're exploring. Special mention from me goes to a certain clown and scarecrow...<br><br>But the game is bogged down by a few problems. Firstly, it's very dark. I had to turn brightness all the way up and it was still super dark. This would be fine, but you don't get your flashlight until a bit into the game, and I found myself stumbling through the dark for a while before I eventually found it. A second flaw is that while new elements get added in scares and the like, the gameplay remains mostly the same, making the later parts sometimes feel rather tedious. On this, in some of the later areas when a lot of the estate is opened up to you, sometimes there's very little indication of where you're supposed to go, leading you to randomly scout rooms to see if you spot any keys or if any events trigger. Spend too long searching, and your character will eventually tell you where to go, but it seems disappointing and not well designed especially since the game at some points does an excellent job at leading you to specific parts of the house with cues, sounds, and graphical things.<br><br>Also the last area of the game and the ending are slightly confusing and come out of left field, and I found the last area ended up being kind of trial and error with getting past it as it's a bit too harsh on your health and scares to get through all of it.<br><br>Still, it turned out better than I expected and I enjoyed playing it. It reminded me of a game version of those horror movies about characters stupidly staying at an obviously haunted house that gets worse as time goes on. Some good atmosphere and scares steal the show here, even if not all moments are winners. It's held back by a few problems, but if you want a haunted house simulator to play through, this is a pretty solid effort.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('11560267', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '11560267' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary11560267\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '11560267' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary11560267\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '11560267', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11560267_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary11560267_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t87 of 115 people (76%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">7 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>56 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary12811292\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"88708770\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1033385e58e7d643b41c6983c8afafd2b3e5a657.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1033385e58e7d643b41c6983c8afafd2b3e5a657.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/10\/1033385e58e7d643b41c6983c8afafd2b3e5a657_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/\" data-miniprofile=\"88708770\">rjmacready<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/games\/?tab=all\">1,422 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/recommended\/\">363 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198048974498\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">9.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 5, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am currently unemployed, and sometimes worry that others may be &quot;right&quot; when they opine that I should NOT be waking up as late as 3 or 4pm in the afternoon.  I am glad to see that this game has cured me of any such concerns, as our main protagonist, in spite of having set himself a task of exploring a spooky haunted mansion over the course of thirty days, seemingly elects to get up no earlier than 5-5.30pm each and every day (judging by how quickly the sun goes down).  And considering how low he is on flashlight batteries and matches - indeed, did not even think to bring any with him, but as luck would have it, they are intermittently dispersed throughout said mansion - this is perhaps not the wisest of strategies.  Alas, a work ethic is a work ethic, and if he feels he is most efficient at night, I can only empathise.  Like a male \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, it would seem both myself and the hero of Pineview Drive do our best work after dark.  (It's a burden sometimes, but someone must be up to the task.)<br> <br>   It would also appear that our protagonist is either an avid horror gamer himself, or failing that, someone aspiring to join the team of the Most Haunted TV series.  Because for whatever reason - &quot;searching for clues&quot; which have something to do with his wife, apparently - he gets up every evening, at the crack of sunset, and wanders around the house just HOPING something spooky will happen.  He searches the same rooms, over and over again, night after night, to see what spooky tricks the mansion might have to throw at him THIS time...as sooner or later, one of these spooky events is destined to lead to the finding of yet another KEY.  <br><br>   Yes...sigh...it's one of THOSE games.  <br><br>   In fact, whereas other horror and\/or first-person games intersperse door-locking &quot;puzzles&quot; with slight variations on the theme, such as turning cranks or, well, actually solving PUZZLES perhaps, this one pretty much operates on the principle of forever looking for a key which wasn't there five seconds before said spookiness occurred.  Well, okay, sometimes it takes a smidgen longer than five seconds to acquire the key...for example, you might be standing near some windows and hear some creepy childish laughter, and look out the window to see a ghostly young lady on a set of swings outside.  So what does our humble hero do next?  Well, like we all would, he decides it's time to venture outside, into a storm, in the middle of a dark and spooky night, and check out the swings...I mean, we'd all do that, right?  \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 waiting 'til the next day, and DAY-LIGHT...let's go outside right this second, at a time of optimum eeriness, just so we can unnecessarily scare ourselves \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 whilst obtaining yet another key (which would, presumably, still be there in the morning or afternoon if we'd only wait).  <br><br>   This &quot;logic&quot; is by no means the worst of the game's problems, however.  Scenarios like the one I just described, while a tad bemusing, are frankly a God-send compared to the numerous bits in the game where you simply HAVE NO \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING IDEA WHAT TO DO NEXT.  Fortunately, after about ten or so minutes of fruitless wandering about, your character will eventually muse something aloud like, &quot;I don't know why, but I have a feeling I should go and check the children's room again&quot;...which, while a bit LATE in coming, would still be something of a God-send IF WE COULD ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHERE THE CHILDREN'S ROOM IS.  If ever a game needed a map...THIS IS THAT GAME; not just to help find a room we know we're specifically looking for, but indeed to save us walking up to almost every single door in the house (which consists of several floors, AND several wings) to see which one our latest key might happen to fit...which is to say, a map could have clearly shown us which doors we HAVEN'T managed to unlock as of yet, narrowing things down a bit.  Something as simple as that could have saved THIS particular gamer, at the very least, a good few hours of unnecessary gameplay, and significantly tightened up the pacing and structure of the game while we're at it.  Wouldn't that have been nice?  Just a thought.<br><br>   Oh, and I haven't yet mentioned the game's supposedly innovative &quot;fear-detection&quot; system...which basically adds up to you losing a bit of &quot;health&quot; every time you jerk the mouse too suddenly after a scare, or keep the run button held down during such encounters, or...something like that.  Personally, I found this little feature to be almost null-and-void for the first twenty-nine chapters, as I barely ever took &quot;damage&quot; anyway.  That is, until Day 30, at which point the balance completely flips in the opposite direction and you can barely even MOVE FORWARD without the game interpreting said &quot;violent&quot; motion as sheer-and-utter-horror on your behalf.  It's a bit poorly-executed, in other words, and kinda borderline pointless even if it HAD been flawlessly implemented.  Still, I'm sure it was a nice idea on paper, a bit like the first Amnesia's almost equally pointless &quot;sanity&quot; system.  Full points for trying something different, though...<br> <br>   Now, if it sounds like I'm giving this game a hard rap, don't believe a second of it.  I actually really, really liked this game.  At least until the bewildering final chapter and the ludicrously baffling final cut-scene which follows it.  Sure the game's a tad long (THIRTY DAYS?  Was it really necessary for us to endure THIRTY DAYS?!), rather repetitive, and not really all that &quot;scary&quot; (&quot;spooky&quot; is definitely the more appropriate word, as it's ultimately more bark than bite)...but other than this, if you were the kind of kid, like yours truly, who used to enjoy wandering around abandoned schoolyards and empty old houses at night in some attempt to try and scare yourself silly, this is the kind of game you can probably get behind.  But be warned:  You really DO need to be that kind of person, who enjoys EXPLORING things, and RE-EXPLORING them, and RE-EXPLORING THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, or else this is gonna bore you stupid in no time; not least of all because the occasional &quot;hints&quot; as to where to go next are generally few and far between.  <br><br>   In all fairness, this IS a tiny bit more than just a &quot;walking simulator&quot; - you can at least add &quot;key-finding simulator&quot;, &quot;door-unlocking simulator&quot; and &quot;note-finding simulator&quot; to that list - but there isn't a great deal more to it than that.  Like any good horror game, it's really just the vaguest semblance of a &quot;plot&quot;, ultimately serving as an excuse for the game to throw a certain number of super-atmospheric and spooky &quot;set-pieces&quot; your way.

As the review from Venus explains much better than I can, when you do find a key, it isnt because you found it, but because something in the house wanted you to have it at that time. It keeps the pace of the story, rather than throwing everything (the entire house) at you at once and expecting you to find very specific clues. <br><br>You start out returning to the mansion to find out what happened 20 years ago to a woman named Linda. When you first enter, most of the rooms are locked. So as it gets dark, you explore the yard, enter the house, and poke at the few rooms that are open. At first, its a fairly calm atmosphere, if a little creepy. Once its fully dark though, that changes. Things start happening like objects moving, hearing strange noises, lights flicker out, etc. Rooms youve been to previously have things moved in them occasionally (so its highly recommended to revist rooms youve already been to just to double check for clues). Eventually &quot;something&quot; will lead you to a key, or to an event that will reward you with a key. As you open more rooms, you find more pages, which gives you hints as to what happened 20 years ago. Theres no risk of finding certain pages too early, or too late, as the game gives you the right keys to get to the right pages, in the right order. <br><br>As far as graphics, they arent bad (little dated), but I still got low fps. With a gtx970, I ended up leaving the settings on medium to keep it smooth around 50-60 fps. Its probably an optimization issue, so youll need to play with the settings yourself to see what works best for you.<br><br>Audio was fantastic. Loved the atmosphere it created. One thing that did get slightly annoying was that direction of the audio wasnt always a good indicator of which floor it came from. You might be standing on the ground floor, hear something you would swear is directly to your left, then find out it was on the floor above you. Not game breaking, but certainly a little annoying when you are hunting for clues and all you get is an audio one.<br><br>Speaking of clues, dont worry about getting stuck for too long. One of my biggest issues with indie horror games, is that it can be easy to get &quot;stuck&quot; and break the flow of the game if you overlook something, or just cant figure out a puzzle. This game has a very nice (and my new favorite) system for giving you hints when you get stuck\/take too long to get to the next clue. After about 15 minutes or so, your character will say something along the lines of &quot;I could have sworn I heard something outside&quot; or &quot;Maybe I missed something when I came through the music room&quot;, depending on the room the next clue is in. <br><br>The story of the game is pretty good, but the ending was a little obtuse (though it does make sense). The dev has posted official explanations though if it interests you, so I highly recommend checking the discussion boards. I cant say much more about the story without ruining it, but it was certainly a shock and makes sense ultimately.<br><br>Another feature the game has that I loved, was that it &quot;gauges&quot; your fear\/reactions. Running a lot, jerking your camera, etc, are all things that will increase the activity in the house. Youll get more sounds, more objects moving, more of the ghost appearing, all things to try and scare you even more. I loved it as it sort of forces you to control yourself to earn certain achievements. Get too scared though, and you run out of health,die, and have to reload that day.<br><br>As far as game bugs, I only found one where my character got locked in a room as part of a scene, but after the scene played out, the door never unlocked. Reloaded and it worked normally.<br><br>Speaking of reloading, the game doesnt have a save feature, but it does have a sort of checkpoint system. After everyday, the game saves before it starts the next day. The days arent super long (anywhere from 10-20 minutes long), so it shouldnt be a major issue. The longest day is probably the last, so be aware that the end day could take a good half hour and doesnt have a save.<br><br>Overall, I loved this game, and Im fairly shocked that it isnt rated much higher than it currently is. As far as indie horror (heck, even the high end horror games), this one is my new favorite. I loved the atmosphere, the random spooks, everything. The house was gorgeous, creepy, and fun to explore. Whoever made this absolutely nailed the old, haunted house vibe, and it was an absolute treat to finally find a game that lets us explore a haunted house without constant jumpscares around every turn, or chase scenes\/things that physically kill you.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('21013333', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '21013333' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary21013333\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '21013333' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary21013333\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '21013333', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21013333_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary21013333_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary24774451\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006957460\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"46691732\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcaaf80f41724fa1bed2bf5b92d5376eac01c539.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcaaf80f41724fa1bed2bf5b92d5376eac01c539.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/dc\/dcaaf80f41724fa1bed2bf5b92d5376eac01c539_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006957460\/\" data-miniprofile=\"46691732\">\u2622Rooby Booby\u2622<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006957460\/games\/?tab=all\">114 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006957460\/recommended\/\">12 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198006957460\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">4.2 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 8, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI can see why many people may not like this game. I find it questionable, but Steam doesn't offer a middle line for reviews (and the fact that the game got me good the first time I tried it is the only reason I'm rating it positive).<br><br>My only complaints so far is the whole key-fetching system (can get annoying), the hint system forces you to wait if you don't know what to do, unless you bump straight into what you need to do, I was unable to fetch the story by the end of the game. The game's performance (mostly blamable on me because of my PC, but others with a GTX970 also complained of performance issues) is rather sporadic, especially when all the shadows are rendering (puts me to ~10FPS), so I have to wait until it turns dark to reach ~40FPS.<br><br>The game has its potential, but the execution part fell short IMO.

Pineview Drive gets the atmosphere part right to some effect, but it unfortunately lacks the necessary depths to immerse one in its world and offer a truly thrilling experience.The story is delivered in short bursts that are unfortunately too vague and unengaging to hook you and make you interested in sticking around long enough to find what\u2019s going on. There are no puzzles, there is no action, there is pretty much nothing to do but look around for keys randomly left around that unlock random doors to new rooms that have little to offer.The game relies a bit too much on our innate fear of the dark. It feels genuinely creepy at times, but more often than not, you are stuck circling endlessly at a very slow pace, attempting to find something new or something that you missed during your previous rounds.The overall experience is very tedious and slow, as Pineview Drive doesn\u2019t even allow you to grab an axe (that you stumble upon, just can\u2019t pick up) and smash doors open, and coerces you into being the perfect gentleman, who doesn\u2019t stoop to breaking windows with rocks or jumping over the fence just because he doesn\u2019t have the right key to open a lock.It\u2019s disappointing really, because there\u2019s not much going on, you have to constantly backtrack, and there is no reaction to the various instances of tame poltergeist such as furniture pieces piled on top of one another and other such weird occurrences.The gameplay revolves around looking for keys and feels very contrived and lacks the kind of flow that would allow the developer to get away with this.Pineview Drive advertises itself as a game that knows when you\u2019re afraid, and thus gauges your reaction to sudden noises and other such things, but does nothing to tell you what you\u2019re supposed to do in such a situation.Luckily, your health pool is pretty generous and these moments do not come up very often. It\u2019s in a way better than older games that threw monsters at you and had you smash them upside the head with a sledgehammer, but it would still need a bit more interactivity in order to function properly.You won\u2019t be attacked by anything in a physical sense and you won\u2019t even explicitly see bizarre apparitions, not in the beginning at least, since you\u2019ll be too busy backtracking and searching for letters from your disappeared wife, that mysteriously pop up around the house.Further in your journey, the electrical lights will cease to function, making everything even more annoying. The overall vibe of the game is that it\u2019s less about being a horror game but more along the lines of a reminder to pack camping gear unless you like to wander aimlessly in the dark.When there\u2019s light, the game looks pretty good, especially the vegetation, but it also requires quite a bit of processing power to do so. Walking around the garden in the middle of the day was pretty enjoyable, if uneventful.If you like horror games where there is nothing much to do, you\u2019ll most likely enjoy its atmosphere, in spite of its slow pace. Unfortunately, the creepy vibe that the game nails is not enough to carry all of it, especially due to the slim narrative, which severely detracts from the entire experience.Overall 6\/10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14343679', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14343679' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14343679\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14343679' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14343679\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14343679', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14343679_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14343679_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30535327\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038825555\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"78559827\">Mustang Minardi<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 16.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 15\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a really small simple game, I found it to be one of the best games I've played.

Please do play Pineview drive. The sound design, atmosphere, and graphics are some of the most amazing i've seen in the horror game scene in a few years. The more you react to scares and do different things in the game it will adapt and attempt to scare you more. The health system is also based on this and how you react to scares.The scares and sounds will lead you to the next objective. This game does not hold your hand, you need to learn the twisting hallways of the house and where each room is, locked and unlocked. At some point it will become clear where to go or try as an objective, but it takes time to learn the house and plot to get there. You will arrive at a house that is almost completely locked up. You will need to find a keys over a total of 30 days to explore the house and property, on average unlocking a door or two a day. The day ends when you find a note that will expand on the story. The game takes patience. You will need to manage your light sources (match sticks and flashlight batteries). Flashlight starts to become unusable at 1 battery level. You will need to rely on lighting candles and jumping to and from lightsources to avoid losing health in the dark. Many who dislike the game run out of light sources and are lost in the darkness. You start each day with what you have left. There are additional spawns of batteries and matchsticks over the days throughout the already explored house. You can relight candle sticks. They will go out at the end of the night and they also have a chance of being blown out. The game has a day and night system, with the night coming sooner every passing day. If you take long enough and are unable to progress your character will remark about hearing a noise in a portion of the house or grounds to clue you where to go. The trick is to know where that is and how to get there. I found that it helped to find a place to hang out in the middle of the house conserving light sources and standing by a lit candle until your character gives you the clue to progress. I used a food storage room that opened from one side with a candle by the door and faced away from the window on nights I found I did not have enough light source to progress on my own and needed help. Even though this is in essence a key finding simulator, it takes a degree of skill to progress efficiently. After completing the game I had several critiques to the ending(the last night) as all the way to there I was blown away by the quality of the game. I felt the very tip of the end was lacking, but after understanding the plot and end, I accept it. On a side note in my opinion I wish the developer had put a limit on the matchsticks and candles to increase the difficulty and dismay camping. For instance candles would be spawned in a random condition (full stick, half stick, stub) that could hold a total of 3 times lighted by a matchstick and would degrade each time until they are unusable for the rest of the game. They would go out at the end of each night, and stay in the condition you left them in (3 use candle-&gt; use-&gt; lit-&gt; chance of being blown out or night end-&gt;next day-&gt;2 use candle is there). I also would like if using a matchstick did not always work. The strike and spark, no fire (1\/10 probability). It would make the decision to add a light or explore an area much more treacherous increasing the risk of taking a chance to find the keys. It also adds a level of punishment to new players who then learn throughout the nights that the candle resources are running out and would further push the player to learn how to conserve the resources and make smart decisions regarding paths to take through the house, learning new paths as shortcuts open up, and memorizing the layout of the house and candles. The game is full of easter eggs and is drawn from many horror sources.

Very low frames, lighting problems, skipping, etc... I was also playing on a computer that is basically a potato plugged into the wall. Eventually got a gaming PC built with a good graphics card and all my problems were gone. Seeing all of the reviews that scream &quot;UNPLAYABLEEE!11!!&quot; make me think that its the computer and not the game. <br><br>Now that I can actually play it, the game is great. Spoopy jumpscares and the music keeps me on edge the entire time. I noticed a lot of the jumpscares seem to be random which is great! Keeps it unexpected. The ending IS a little odd and out of place, but whatever. I still like the game. Atmosphere is great. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29211322', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29211322' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29211322\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29211322' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29211322\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29211322', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29211322_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29211322_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short28902592\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Itama\/recommended\/288880\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"49839265\">Itama<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 2.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe thing with this game is, it sucks, if you don't have proper sound output.<br>But when you play it with good headphones, this game is more scary than Outlast (yep i played it right before i started this game)<br>Outlast was a really good game, don't get me wrong, but after a while i wasn't scared.<br>Here it's totally different, the father I get into this game, the more and more scarier it gets for some reason. It's because you never know what's coming next and when. No, this game is not full of Jumpscares, they sure are some in it, but they are mostly well done in my opinion. It's more about the Atmosphere, Music and Ambience.<br><br>So All in All, the gameplay lacks a bit, you are always walking around, searching for the next key to open the next door, but if you want to get a game, which gets you on your limit with it's creepy atmosphere, GET IT! <br><br>BUT Remember!

With its constantly tense background music and random spikes in sound effects and melody, it coninuously keeps the player on edge throughout the first half of the game. <br>However, after the first 15 days the game becomes very repeatative and the lack of storyline or variety of sound and music as well as the jumpscares lose their effect. I must say, the second half of the game was hardly even startling despite the occasional jumpscare. The flashlight is also ridiculously dark with an extremely short battery life, making navigating the endless maze of the mansion in its extreme darkness almost impossible at times.<br><br>All in all, it's a good game but not nearly as good as it could be due to its lack of story, direction and variety.<br><br>Here's my full playthrough for anyone who's interested (Link to playlist): <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLYzlb9Rw0iBSMD7P3VizClX3FA3Il8myA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLYzlb9Rw0iBSMD7P3VizClX3FA3Il8myA<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('28807924', 'recent_short' );

However, the game is a bit slow and can be frustrating when your nagivagting the house looking for the keys. Also the game is really dark and it makes it hard to see with out a flashlight... I really hope they changethis in the the sequal.
