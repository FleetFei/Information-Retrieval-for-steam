It adds the automatic platforming\/climbing mechanics and bar-filling collectathon of Assassin's Creed, the overgrown vegetation cityscape of Enslaved, and the sailing of Wind Waker. <br><br>... but then removes all difficulty, danger, combat, and dialogue.<br><br>The core game works like this: You are a young woman. The game opens with you pulling up your small motorboat to a temple in a city almost entirely submerged in water--only the tops of tall buildings like hotels and hospitals stick out from the water. You bring your brother, sick and injured on the brink of death into the temple and lay him on an altar. You set out to explore the ruins of the buildings looking for supply drops to heal him.<br><br>The game proceeds with you taking your boat around the water, looking for landmarks--the most memorable for me was a ruined ferris wheel--animals (mutated sealife, mostly), and collectible books that tell you the story of what happened to the city through little pictograph images that are sort of like cute hieroglyphs. The main game involves climbing large towers to get supply drop cases at the top.<br><br>I should say that climbing the towers is pretty straightforward. The game does not have puzzles, and you do not have limited grip strength. Like an Assassin's Creed tower, it's mostly just about hopping to the next handhold or finding the next ledge. You're a tourist here. If that sounds like something you wouldn't want to play, then I wouldn't buy the game, but I liked it.<br><br>Different towers are different--one is a giant skyscraper where you weave from exterior ledges across vegetated floors, while another has you taking the path to a top of hollow, donut-shaped hospital, and then climbing down and around the inside to get to the rest of the roof. Another has a zip-line at the top of a roof. Are the locations memorable? The negative reviews say no. I found them memorable enough to keep going and tell apart in my head. The towers also have storybook collectibles off hidden paths.<br><br>Like Team Ico's games, the characterization is mostly inferred through very indirect images. There is no voiced dialogue and no explicit explanation or development (again, the family's story is told through unlocking pictographs). But you get the sense of a girl who is protecting her younger brother and doesn't want to give up on him no matter the cost.<br><br>The game lasts around 3 hours with a little more for getting all of the collectibles. At 5 hours, I got my final achievement.<br><br>Visually the game is somewhat simple, but striking in its beauty. The day-night cycle leads to great moments where the sun or moon or weather patterns interact with the scenery. The game provides a photo mode feature that lets you turn off the UI and pick a camera angle. You can take some really wonderful photos.<br><br>Whether or not I'd recommend the game depends entirely on your taste. It's possible you'll buy it and think, &quot;wait, this is it, I'm just doing the same thing again and again, nothing is going on, there's no challenge&quot;. If that's what you think, bummer dude, sorry you didn't like it. But I liked it and if my description sells it to you, then I hope you like it too.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('23848592', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '23848592' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary23848592\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '23848592' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary23848592\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '23848592', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23848592_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary23848592_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t161 of 229 people (70%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">17 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>7 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17379600\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/89\/895aabd4f5b9c87c7dfb087c8ad6777ac6e2ce41_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/\" data-miniprofile=\"82984304\">El Kemosabe<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/games\/?tab=all\">1,218 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/\">191 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/el_kemosabe\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">5.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 4, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmerged is a relaxing exploration game set in a flooded city full of life. You play as Miku, a young girl who has arrived in the flooded city with her wounded brother, Taku, in search of supplies to help nurse him back to full health. You must explore the city, by day and night, in order to find eight supply boxes, the contents of which have the potential to save Taku\u2019s life.<br><br>The story of the game took me 3.4 hours to complete, the rest of my game time comes from just exploring the city.<br><br>Submerged\u2019s gameplay consists of exploring the flooded city using the boat you arrived in and then using your telescope to find items of interest within the world. Once you\u2019ve located items of interest you can travel to the buildings they are on and climb up them in order to collect the items whether they\u2019re the supplies for the story or the other collectibles found in the game.<br><br>+It\u2019s a good looking game, the textures and overall appearance of the game may not be cutting edge but not only do the graphics get the job done, they look nice and suit the game while doing it<br>+The backstory of Miku and Taku is delivered to the player through amazing drawings which are unlocked four at a time whenever you find a new supply box<br>+The story of the game itself is good though it\u2019s very basic due to there being no dialogue in the game, the ending is also good and, in my opinion, somewhat unexpected<br>+Submerged has a full day and night cycle which not only brings some life to the game, it also allows for some great screenshots to be taken, particularly around sunset<br>+Submerged also has dynamic weather events such as thunder storms<br>+The game has 86 collectibles (not including the story items) so there\u2019s plenty to do even after you\u2019ve finished the story, 60 of these collectibles are pieces of the city\u2019s story so unlocking them all will help you understand how the city has come to be the way it is<br>+The flooded city is home to a few different types of wildlife, such as dolphins and whales, which again helps to bring life to the game <br>+The game\u2019s soundtrack is fantastic, the music is relaxing but at the same time it gives a real feeling of isolation to the game<br>+The controls, particularly for climbing, are very simple making the game easy to play (I used a 360 Gamepad to play)<br><br>+\/-The game has a \u2018Make a Postcard\u2019 mode which is basically a way to set up screenshots, I like the idea of it a lot as someone who loves screenshots but using it forces the game\u2019s logo on to your screenshot which I\u2019m not a fan of, I imagine most people won\u2019t care hence it\u2019s in the +\/- section<br><br>-Submerged is blantantly overpriced, for a game which can be completeted in around 2 hours a regular price of \u00a314.99 is too much <br>-Some of the game\u2019s animations, in particular how Miku walks, look clunky and unrealistic<br>-There isn\u2019t enough music! Like I said early the soundtrack is fantastic but it just isn\u2019t played regularly enough in the game<br>-The game looks awful if the graphics settings are lower than medium and when I tried the game out on low I really didn\u2019t enjoy it as much so if you don\u2019t think you can run it on medium or higher then you may wish to think twice about buying the game<br><br>Verdict:<br>Worth Purchasing on Sale (6.5\/10)<br><br>Submerged is an excellent exploration game that is relaxing to play, has good graphics and is set in a very interesting world. I wanted to give Submerged a much higher score than I did but with its current price I simply can't recommend it, wait for this one to go on sale.<br><br><b>Review Copy Provided.<\/b><br><br><i>No drama, <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/justreviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Just Reviews.<\/a><\/i><br><br>El K.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17379600', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17379600' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17379600\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17379600' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17379600\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17379600', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17379600_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17379600_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">5 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25054607\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar online\" data-miniprofile=\"84336878\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c50136d7132b5ebc1757d0f201b69173fd76af7a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c50136d7132b5ebc1757d0f201b69173fd76af7a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/c5\/c50136d7132b5ebc1757d0f201b69173fd76af7a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/\" data-miniprofile=\"84336878\">[slckr]robilar5500<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/games\/?tab=all\">4,250 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/recommended\/\">210 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/robilar5500\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">26.4 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 21, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Submerged<\/div> is a single player exploration\/adventure game set in a partially submerged city, the remnants of an undisclosed apocalyptic event. You play as a nameless older sister trying to save the life of your younger brother who has suffered a grievous wound that has caused him to slip into a coma. What happens in this submerged city will decide the fate of both you and your brother.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Story<\/div><br><br>The story in Submerged is quite interesting in its presentation. Rather than relying on dialogue, notes, or anything coming close to resembling that, it relies solely on actual exploration which triggers events and unlocks hieroglyphic frames that in turn unveil a riveting and yet somewhat indistinct tale.<br><br>For this reason, while the main story revolving around your attempt to heal and bring your brother out of his coma are clear, the events preceding this and the way in which the world found itself submerged, post-apocalyptic state are completely a matter of personal interpretation.<br><br>I found the subjective interpretation of the story in Submerged to be particularly enjoyable. Based on everything I witnessed and interacted within the game, I have drawn this tale for myself (feel free to reach your own conclusions though):<br><br>The world isnt completely covered in water. This is suggested through the hieroglyphs you unlock via completing story goals. The sister and brother fled their home on the boat which you, the sister, use throughout the game due to the events which caused the brother\u2019s severe injuries. The apocalypse seems to have included radiation somehow, as the water and all the creatures have a peculiar coloration and glow to them. The apocalypse also seems to have happened far back in the past as the buildings that remain have been overtaken by plant life and people seem to have regressed to tribalism.<br><br>Anyway, those are just some of my thoughts on the story. I found myself thoroughly engaged throughout my playthrough, coming up with theories regarding the world presented while taking in the story arc focus of the siblings themselves. The story in Submerged receives an 8.5 out of 10.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div><br><br>The gameplay in Submerged was quite intuitive. I never found myself having any issues with the controls and experienced no bugs whatsoever.<br><br>There are a couple actual gameplay aspects to this game. Your main mode of transportation will be your boat. Simple steering via L\/R sticks, acceleration\/brakes with your R1\/L1, and speed boost with L2. You will find the wreckage of other boats in the city, and these allow you to upgrade your speed boost, which gives it a longer duration. The only real practical use for this is simply to get around the city faster, as there are no enemies to worry about and no hazards to face.<br><br>Climbing is the other important aspect to Submerged. You will be seeking out old supply drops, presumably dating back to before or just after whatever apocalyptic events that changed the world actually occurred. The supply drops are found on the top of some of the taller buildings you must climb. The routes upward are rarely straightforward, and each of these buildings also features \u201csecrets\u201d, which take the form of books that reveal a little bit more about the world. The supply drops themselves essentially represent the chapters in Submerged, with each one found triggering the next part of the story as you work towards healing your brother and bringing him out of his coma.<br><br>You have a telescope which you can use to get a better view of things. However, a more practical use of the telescope is its help in identifying the location of overturned boats, collectibles and supply drops. There is also a map which I found to be quite useful in finding areas I had missed and remembering where supply drops I had spied previously were actually located relative to my position on the map.<br><br>Other things of note in Submerged are the aquatic wildlife which you will observe and in their totality unlock an achievement in the game. There are also a number of landmarks to be found. Each one is named and one of them is required to unlock two more achievements.<br><br>The gameplay was fairly well seamless. It deserves a 9 out of 10<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics<\/div><br><br>Submerged is one of the more beautiful games you will ever encounter. Not only is the desolation, mystery, vibrancy and vigor of this mostly drowned city brought to life in full effect, but the detail involved in every frame was both stunning and awe-inspiring. There actually is a postcard mode in game to help show off the graphics but really, they dont need any help. Submerged is a gorgeous game through and through.<br><br>This is an easy 10 out of 10. Few games are as beautiful to behold. You will spend a lot of your play time simply taking in the amazing vistas.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Sound<\/div><br><br>The audio in Submerged was somewhat dynamic, shifting based on mood, time of day, progression through the story and so on. However, in my opinion it was also the weakest part of this game. Though well done, you will have heard every track pretty quickly during your playthrough and then for the rest of the game after that. The saving grace for this is that the music never gets annoying and really just serves as a backdrop to the story and scenery in Submerged anyway. Unobtrusive despite its repetitiveness.<br><br>7.5 hits the mark for this category.<br><br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict<\/div><br><br>Ultimately, Submerged is a game that truly shines in both conveying a sense of desolation and mystery while still offering serenity and a compelling, if subjective story. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game and hope to see more adventure\/walking simulator style games offer similarly deep experiences in the future.<br><br>One further note for achievement hunters. There is a free roam option after you finish the story so as to find any missing collectibles and ship parts.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">8.8 Buildings submerged by an undisclosed calamity that became hosts for a beautiful new, lush, and mysterious world out of 10 possible.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25054607', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25054607' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25054607\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25054607' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25054607\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25054607', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25054607_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25054607_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">1 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary25486542\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">73.1 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: September 12, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFailure tends to be a core principle of gaming. Whether you\u2019re running a level, fighting a mob, or tackling a mission, you must succeed, or try, try again. Submerged does away with the pressures of dying or failing, and instead lets you loose in a waterlogged playground, content to let you explore to your heart\u2019s extent. No fail states, just beautiful vistas and crashing waves.<br><br>In this stunning game published by Uppercut Games, you find yourself playing as Miku, a young and selfless girl who will do anything to keep her brother, Taku, healthy. In an interesting twist, Uppercut Games have ignored combat entirely and have focused on exploration and story in this third person adventure. You navigate your way through a flooded city in search of supplies to help your wounded brother while pushing your own needs aside as Miku is gradually being consumed by some sort of post-apocalyptic mutation virus. As time goes on, you learn more and more about Miku\u2019s family and what brought her and her brother to where they are now.<br><br>Miku spends half her time scaling the sides of the structures and the other half in her boat. Scaling walls is just a matter of finding ledges or flowery vines and then moving in the required direction. Sailing Miku's boat is simple too - just point Miku in the right direction and then move. She can collect upgrades to her boat that enable a speed boost as well. There really isn't too much to the game other than exploration. The fact that Miku cannot fall and that Submerged is a non-combat game makes it suitable to all ages. <br><br>As Miku explores her surroundings, she will come across a number of collectibles. Some of these collectibles, when combined, will tell a pictorial tale of how the city became to be submerged underwater. Also, as she finds the supplies she requires to heal her brother Taku, the story of how Miku and Taku came to be floating on their raft is revealed. Healing her brother forms the main storyline and can be completed rather quickly, but there are other collectibles that extend the length of the game. Finding all the special Landmarks, the complete set of Hotels and all the upgrades to Miku's boat can take some time, especially as some are reasonably well hidden and cannot be spied using Miku's telescope.<br><br>The story itself was incredibly interesting, especially as you get to discover more and more of it as the game continues. What I particularly liked however was the fact that the story was actually told through hieroglyphic type drawings\u2013 so although the back story of the family and the story of the city are certain and set in stone, their vague drawings give the player the ability to interpret them slightly how they see fit.<br><br>One thing I didn\u2019t particularly understand though was the unusual post-apocalyptic mutated people who stalk Miku through her journey. Throughout the game Miku\u2019s body is being taken over by a virus, presumably from being exposed to the toxic looking water that she sails on through the sunken city and climbing up the infected mossy and destroyed buildings. With every emergency rations pack you find to help Taku, you see a cut scene of Miku sailing back to their home base to help him \u2013 when this happens you see these mutated people watching her and you assume that at the end of the game this is what Miku will become. Miku is obviously aware of them too as in one cut scene she has a nightmare that they are coming to get her.<br><br>My instinctive reaction to these mutants was that I would probably have to fight them when the time came to escape, like you would have to in most games. In these moments you forget that this game has entirely disregarded combat. In the end, recovered and healthy Taku wakes up to find the mutants surrounding Miku as they magically release the virus from her, then they allow her and Taku to leave peacefully on their boat. I wasn\u2019t keen on this when it happened personally \u2013 I could get on board with the post-apocalyptic virus, the mutated people and everything else the game put forward, but the weird magical powers really threw me off. At that point I wasn\u2019t sure if the mutants were actually humans or not, it just confused me too much.<br><br>There's a full weather and day\/night cycle that shows off an array of sunsets that have you stopping halfway up ladders to snap a picture and the sunny days are beautifully bright and almost allow you to forget that the world has ended. It's not all sunshine and sunsets though, there are stormy times too as the rain lashes down and the night scenes make up for the lack of electrical light via moonlight, and the glowing algae surrounding the buildings on the water's surface are nice touches that evoke memories of the film adaptation of Life of Pi. There's some surprising wildlife to discover too, but I don't want to spoil everything for you.<br><br>It's hard to pin down exactly where the game is set, it seems to be a fictional city with architecture you're just as likely to spot in Europe as you are in America. Keep an eye out for the landmarks as you tick them off though, especially the buildings' names. There seems to be something of a theme of sunken worlds, coded into them. For example, the Saaftinge Hospital links to Saeftinghe, a Dutch town that was consumed by a swamp in 1584. Or there's the Rullyeh hotel with the name resembling R'lyeh, a sunken city and the prison of Cthulhu found in the works of H.P. Lovecraft.<br><br>The graphics in the game are spectacular and they make the game what it is in my opinion. The vibrant colours and the sunken city scene are so beautifully detailed they make you want to sail around and explore as much of the map as you can find just to see it all. The stunning graphics are also contrasted by just how simple the hieroglyphic diagrams telling the story in Miku\u2019s journal are. It all works very well together and I can\u2019t really fault it.<br><br>The soundtrack, from BAFTA award-winning composer Jeff Van Dyck,  is also wonderful, opening with one of the strongest and most captivating tracks, and using punctuated piano keys and slowly building crescendos to build the mood of each moment. It\u2019s no surprise that ex-2k developers who cut their teeth on titles like the original Bioshock have nailed this aquatic dystopian atmosphere so well, but Submerged goes above and beyond the call, and creates an interactive portrait just begging to be dove into head-first.<br><br>Now time for the usual question: Should you go and play Submerged? Definitely. If you\u2019re looking for something different and stunning, this is definitely worth trying.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('25486542', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '25486542' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary25486542\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '25486542' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary25486542\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '25486542', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25486542_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary25486542_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>2 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20109535\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/estranged2\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"29755808\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fd6b931e26a5a5b098cc30b19c7590bfc4e0e76b.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fd6b931e26a5a5b098cc30b19c7590bfc4e0e76b.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/fd\/fd6b931e26a5a5b098cc30b19c7590bfc4e0e76b_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/estranged2\/\" data-miniprofile=\"29755808\">Estranged2<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/estranged2\/games\/?tab=all\">261 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/estranged2\/recommended\/\">27 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/estranged2\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">19.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: December 30, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf I have to compare this game to other titles, I'd say - Another World, Brothers, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, Limbo. Action-adventures in which you care about someone else, and there's some form of drama.<br>Exploration and drama. That's what this game is all about. To some extent, it is inspired by the interactive hopelessness in the face of your impending doom, a theme explored by games like Shadow of the Colossus and Journey. But Submerged does something new with it. It is an emotional experience and goes in a direction that most games would never take.<br><br>It's quite shocking that the game is almost completely devoid of challenge. There's no violence even though there are scary things in the world. There are no puzzles, and you can't die. I usually hate games that don't offer challenge... but this game successfully challenged my obsession with challenge. <br>Because of the inability to die and make real mistakes, some people tagged this &quot;a walking simulator&quot;, but the gameplay does way more than that. Just exploring the city, recovering its story, climbing buildings with the cute teen protagonist, searching for secrets, and being paranoid about things that may cause potential infection, and also, who's friend and who's foe, provided me with enough choice and thrill to keep playing. <br><br>Also, it's the first game I've played that does environmental storytelling so well - the first game that made me really enjoy piecing together the story of the city, of the world, of its inhabitants, of my own origin, all of that without any words being used, or explanations handed to me. You can even decipher the glyphs in the game in a very intuitive way. <br>The lack of violence allows for a unique way to relate to the other... lifeforms that you meet - your doubts, your fears, your hopes when you meet them wouldn't have been the same if you had a weapon you could wield whenever you felt insecure. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> Also, if you assume that they may be a giant consciousness controlled by the green plants it doesn't make sense for them to be outright hostile to you - you're going to become one of them anyway, they might as well help you. There is a sick temptation in accepting your fate and joining these creatures which is a nuanced, complicated feeling and you can't have nuance if you use simple videogame violence.<\/span><\/span><br>Finally, the way you're moving towards your inevitable doom just to help someone you love is done better than any other game I've played. Come to think of it, all 3 things mentioned in this paragraph (uncovering the story through the environment, dubious creatures that are maybe friends, maybe foes, and doom and self-sacrifice) are present in some form in Shadow of the Collosus, but I'd dare to say that this here is done better and affected me more (if it weren't for the ruined ending). It reminded me why playing and making games is worth it, something that all the noise around me makes me forget.<br><br>P.S. Unfortunately, the ending sucks. <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>In a &quot;Minority Report&quot;, deus ex machina, happy way. This game cannot afford to end on a happy, light note, but it did.<\/span><\/span> Still, I usually care more about a game's idea than about its execution.

No More.<br><br>This game does an amazing job hooking you from the store; it just has that majestic city look that makes you want to dive right in! At first glance the world is breathtaking, giving me exactly what I want. The campaign was minimalistic, no words are exchanged, but still an interesting story evolves. You piece together the history of the former city while working to save your brother who is dwindling. The campaign is progressed by finding the (10) supplies needed to save your brother\u2019s life; of course these are always atop the highest points! <br><br>Unfortunately, my high hopes were soon deflated. I was able to traverse the entire map in about 10 minutes. So although it's an open world it proves to be quite small. The campaign was completed for me in about 3.5 hours and that's with exploring the whole map and just cruising around. The world is beautiful but quite repetitive, for how small the world is I would have liked to see some more dynamic buildings.<br><br>The game does have some good stuff going on especially with the boating and climbing which the game revolves around.  The climbing mechanics is exactly like Assassins Creed where you must dangle and navigate up a perilous building to reach the objective. The boating is pretty awesome; you command a small vessel that is greatly impacted by the hostility of the waves. <br><br>Overall, $20 is crazy expensive for this! Based on the content and experience I'd look to grab this for $5 or so!<br><br><div class=\"bb_code\"><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Accidently Reviewed<\/div>Was this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Would have liked a more bittersweet ending given some of the revelations that occur during the story.<br><br>I'd like to see a NG+ mode and perhaps a time challenge mode patched in to give the game some challenge, but I got my money's worth for the story alone.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17409591', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17409591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17409591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17409591' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17409591\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17409591', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17409591_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17409591_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>3 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17620400\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/surlybitch\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"8634491\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d27acff4eb792d0fcedbcc2c9ec9c8e483c3666c.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d27acff4eb792d0fcedbcc2c9ec9c8e483c3666c.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/d2\/d27acff4eb792d0fcedbcc2c9ec9c8e483c3666c_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/surlybitch\/\" data-miniprofile=\"8634491\">ChuckleBags<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/surlybitch\/games\/?tab=all\">413 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/surlybitch\/recommended\/\">30 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/surlybitch\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.8 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 19, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThree stories are told in this game: that of a city, a family, and a girl with more upper body strength than any human in history.

Even though I had missed a secret (due to my blindness), I didn't mind trying to find it.<br><br>The graphics are extremely beautiful, and the effects are amazing. The water looks and moves realisticly, and it is neat to ride the wake from a nearby whale that has jumped from the water. The trees swaying in the wind, the flowers moving back and forth, the butterflies flitting from place to place. All highly realistic, and a joy to look at.<br><br>There are also really good weather effects, such as rain, thunder\/lightning, and fog. The sunlight and moonlight glisten off the water almost magically, as if they had a secret to tell, but couldn't.<br><br>Discovering the various landmarks and other unique buildings and signs added to the mystique. This takes place on Earth, but is it <i> our <\/i> Earth in the future or an Earth from an alternate universe. There is enough to make it familiar, yet alien at the same time.<br><br>I have grown quite fond of Miku, and would love to have more adventures with both her and her brother, Taku.<br><br>I did not suffer one crash or any graphical glitches, and it ran smooth as silk even with all the settings at max. You can use mouse\/keyboard, but I used a controller and I am glad that I did. It makes use of the rumble feature (you can turn this on or off in Options), and controlling the boat was quite easy to do.<br><br>This game has absolutely NO combat in it whatsover, nor are you racing against a timer to prevent failure. You can explore at your leisure, and you don't have to worry about doing things out of order. You can explore any of the climbable locations in any order, no matter how close or far. I like having that freedom, and not being boxed in to &quot;go here first&quot;.<br><br>I cannot recommend this game enough. An absolute joy, and I would purchase a sequel (if they ever make one) in a heartbeat.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20495135', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20495135' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20495135\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20495135' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20495135\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20495135', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20495135_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20495135_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"user_reviews_sub_header\">Recently Posted<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30714009\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198038623950\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"78358222\">Tosei<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 6.6 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCute and simple game.

It's rather pretty on the whole, but the textures are bland, the movement animation of the player character is the stiffest I've seen in many years, and the movement of the boat seems unnatural. Also, the only real action in the game--climbing buildings, \u00e0 la Ubisoft towers--is not at all challenging or even clever for the most part. (To be fair, it isn't challenging in Ubisoft games, either; but those games offer other challenges, which this game does not.) <br><br>But then I found myself coming back the next day to play some more. In part this was because of the interesting way the story unfolds via pictograms. There are two stories, one about the main characters, a brother and sister (you play the sister), and the other about how the world came to be &quot;submerged.&quot; The city story is the longer of the two and I found it a bit hard to parse, but I appreciated the unique way the story was told was told. The pictograms are unlocked by finding collectibles, which gives you a reason to explore the world beyond finding the ten supply crates needed to nurse your injured little brother back to health, which is the primary motivation of the game. <br><br>I was also struck by the natural beauty. Though the boat handles rather awkwardly, there are impressive moments as you zip along and a pod of dolphins comes to swim alongside your boat, or a ray soars over your head, or a giant whale breaches the water in front of you, backlit by a lovely sunset. There is no combat and you can't die. The game is just a charming palate cleanser, which is exactly what I needed after almost 45 brutal hours of Mafia 3.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30619035', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30619035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30619035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30619035' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30619035\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30619035', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30619035_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30619035_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30314126\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197995873585\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"35607857\">Princess Dad the Mean<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.7 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI really enjoyed this game, it has a fantastic sound track , good visuals and story.

Beautiful scenery and a variety of detail and special input for great gameplay experience\/atmosphere. The storyline is surprisingly decent. The game is quite simple, lacks consequence which would make the game a bit more intense, but I guess a relaxing game once in awhile isn't bad. It requires a some simple tasks\/missions in order to beat. The tasks are a little bit repetitive, I would have like a little bit more of variety and more focus on the storyline itself. With that being said, I greatly enjoyed the game. 7\/10.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30305034', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30305034' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30305034\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30305034' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30305034\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30305034', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30305034_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30305034_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short30224042\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198133388550\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"173122822\">M.

A relaxing, very pleasant game, with a cute storyline, nice music and graphics and a very enjoyable melancholic atmosphere. Beautiful lighting effects, changing weather, storms, hurricanes, rain, sun, wind, day and night are amazing. Just perfect for these moments of chilling when you just need to do nothing in front of your computer. Nothing complicated here, very simple gameplay, you climb all these wonderful abandoned buildings to discover that strange city's secrets and the story of these two kids. <br><br>You don't fight, you can't die, you can't get hurt. It's all about enjoying the scenery and the soundtrack, exploring that mysterious world submerged by water and filled of an incredible fauna and flora. <br>ASMR gaming :D So relaxing. <br><br>No need to rush, just relax and enjoy it. I have really nice moments every day.<br><br>Good point is you unlock an exploring mode when you finish the game.

No rush, explore and find clues and items.  The puzzles are how to get up the buildings and get access to the items on different levels and roof tops, etc... lots of climbing up and down and trying to figure out the best route. It gets a bit tedious, but wondering where the story line is going keeps you at it  Graphics are pretty amazing with changing weather and time of day.  Really beautiful lighting effects and animated water, rain, etc. Also, lots of surprising water creatures that pop up. <br>There are no instructions as to how to play, you just sort of figure it out as you go using logic and visual clues. The cards that show up are at first non sensical, but as the game progresses you begin to figure out what the symbols on them refer to. If you want a slow moving, enjoyable exploring game, this is great. I ended up using a X360 controler translator to enable my PC Thrustmaster joystick to work in game so that I could control the boat more easily with joy stick buttons for the map, journal, telescope, and boost and the stick controlling the throtle and steering. Much more enjoyable then using the keyboard buttons.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29970217', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '29970217' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short29970217\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '29970217' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short29970217\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '29970217', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29970217_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short29970217_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29966804\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Hawke_404\/recommended\/301860\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"115664273\">Hawke<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 4.9 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>Submerged<\/i> is a third-person action game.
