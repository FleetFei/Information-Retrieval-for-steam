Just finished playing the first scenario for the span of most of the afternoon and i was totally in another world losing track of the time as the violent strategic gameplay and delicious lore rich writing kept me soaking in the intense atmosphere of the new ANGELS OF DEATH DLC. <br><br>Love the look of the new units with incredible amounts of graphical detail whether zoomed in or out with slack jawed eyes popping out my skull awe inspiring paint jobs for the Blood Angels Chapter further highlighted by the awesome wall shaking at earthquake levels audio depicting the horrifying sounds of a futuristic battlefield including environmental sound effects such as the crackle of thunder as if the autocannons of a Dreadnought ripping through ork formations were not nerve shattering enough. <br><br>Many units come with their strengths and weaknesses which seem to really stand out with the ANGELS OF DEATH DLC  compared to before which might also have something to do with the excellent patch updates including the one today. It was pretty cool having a long range unit unable to attack at short range bringing back memories of table top wargaming on the differences,advantages and disadvantages of weapon systems combined with modifiers to make for plenty of interesting outcomes. The humongous amount of units on the battlefield in the ANGELS OF DEATH DLC really captures the epic massive carnage of the Warhammer 40k universe. Orks are as terrifying as ever yet the Blood Angels have a certain terror factor as well wielding their armaments in the name of The Emperor in a valley of flowing death an ocean of deepest red.<br><br>There are many new buildings etc giving maps a new fresh look with plenty of that imperial holy visual appeal one has come to love about the Warhammer 40k universe. Truly there are very few sights as beautiful as seeing units battling to the blood soaked death in trench warfare and WARHAMMER 40,000 ARMAGEDDON-ANGELS OF DEATH has this and much more in spades.<br><br>The Angels Of Death await your orders. Do you serve The Emperor and mankind or will you cower like a stinking sniveling rat in the shadows of ruins til the unfathomable legions of the green tide come to take all that you hold dear from you including your very pathetic life???<br><br>And to think such magnificence of Slitherine gaming quality only cost $4.99 to purchase and pledge your commitment! Your righteous fury unto The Emperor!<br><br>WARHAMMER 40,000 ARMAGEDDON-ANGELS OF DEATH DLC Buy it! Play it! AND BE HAPPY as if taken by THE BLACK RAGE!!!

The mission design this time focuses far more on infantry fighting and there are great hordes of orc infantry units ready to be mowed down by bolter fire from your space marines and the flow of battle have improved greatly this time around.<br><br>Everything that was new to the game in Vulcan's Wrath is still around this time, so I will not dwell into that and overall I didn't feel there was a whole lot of new under the sun mechanical in this DLC except the mission scripting is improved and what secondary missions are has become far more obscure.<br><br>One of the thing that for me differ from the previous releases is that the maps felt far better designed and quite enganging, the game also manages to present us with many differnet styles of maps with focus on different styles of play which is very pleasing.<br><br>The enemies this time is have shifted to a far more infantry based mixed, something the Salamanders would have loved and that the Blood Angels are seemingly expects in as well. The good thing is that the game can present you with far more units without slowing the flow down to a halt trying to wear down a screen full of heavy army units and overal, I found this very enjoyable, however one issue is that different units fail to shine as much as they have earlier, most is dealt with in a similar fashion and that is a bit of a shame.<br><br>Blood Angel units and ... Dreadnoughts, honestly again the dreadnoughts are the foundation of any units their only real downsides are that there is a few pieces of terrain they can't enter and they are not exactly fast other than that they are the best of the best. Looking beyond the dreads the Blood Angel army in this DLC have plenty of requsition and in my play time regular space marines and tactical marines never once saw battle, the cheapest unit I bought at any time was the blackguard space marines which can deal deadly blows to anything on the battlefield, other than that the range of vehicle and infantry include options for supporting fire which seems to be the mainstay of the Blood Angels, making them a nearly immovable object on the enemies turn and the dreads and high value units makes something close to an unstoppable force on your turn, when you get this formular down this DLC will have by far the easiest to date.<br><br>The missions varies greatly from claim X number of victory hexen, destroy all enemy units (which I should mention did not have a single lone unit somewhere you had to spend way to many turns to find, excellent job guys!) to by far my favorite escorting a bunch of chimera armoured personal carriers, which made them highly entertaining and challanging and at no point did it feel repetative, something the base game and Vulcan's Wrath didn't completely escape.<br><br>In a somewhat strange turn around I didn't feel deployment was as important in this DLC as it was in the rest of the game as long as my forces were build around a standard strategy, armoured spear head, support fire back up, and infantry on the same and preferably a leader in the back (not a very WH40kish place for them ohh well). <br><br>I think the only downsides are that the meeting with the Orc warlord was the least memorable of all the content so far, maybe it was simply my setup but he attacked my units and was annihilated same round not even grinding my advance to a halt. It was... anticlimatic. The other downside is that hover and flyers are far far too weak to really have a place in the game this goes for both hostile and allied units they can seemingly be destroyed with impunity by anything they face leaving them no spot in the army at all and their inability to fly over &quot;tall trees&quot; or buildings made them little more than vehicles that could potentially travel across water. AA fire is pointless, whatever they attack will almost or entirely kill them.<br><br>My final thoughts are that I loved the DLC, and the Blood Angels were great fun to play and their mutual supporting structure was far more evident than Steel Legion (imperial guard) or the Salamanders (space marines) making them an easier army to learn to use well. All the missions were fun and II had completed them before I knew it, however I really really still miss the voice acting of the NPCs it gave so much more depth to the missions and the stories. I will recommend this to anyone whom liked the gase game and to some extend I would recommend you play this one before Vulcan's Wrath.<br><br><br>Art: 6 (The maps seemed more pleasing to look at but not enough to change my score from the base game score.)<br>Combat: 8 (Combat was excellent and so is the flow, perhaps a little easy but other than that excellent!)<br>Interface: 5 (it's the same, so no change).<br>Voice acting: 0 (The base game had it and it could have added so much more)<br>Level design: 9 (again much mjuch improved slightly better than Vulcan's Wraith).<br><br>Overall: 6 (same as Vulcan's Wrath but for slightly different reasons, honestlly I recommend this DLC, it is well worth it).<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('15816493', 'summary' );
