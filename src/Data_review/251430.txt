It was such a lovely adventure, I wish it was at least twice as long! The dialogue never stops being funny, and you'll want to say &quot;Awhh, Robeeeert&quot;...and pat little Robert on the head every time his clueless behaviour makes you chuckle. And you will laugh. A lot. Puzzles are not incredibly hard, and the hint system provides you with enough info if, for example, you're actually missing an object (oh, pixel hunting :) ). The story is good, the characters are hilarious with great voice-acting, and Robert... well, he's just a sweet little boy who goes on an adventure! I'm hoping for a sequel actually, only cause I loved the main character so very much! <br><br>Plus, you can sing with your nose!<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('14293211', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '14293211' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary14293211\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '14293211' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary14293211\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '14293211', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14293211_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary14293211_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary26470798\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar in-game\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/f5\/f560c9f13228c205cb0ea28235b18a3cc042cb38_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/\" data-miniprofile=\"192495157\">UN0W3N<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/games\/?tab=all\">2,688 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/\">229 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/UN0W3N\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">3.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: November 6, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"receivedCompensation tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"This reviewer received The Inner World for free.\">Product received for free<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\">Introduction<\/div>The Inner World is developed by Studio Fizbin and published by Headup Games. Dev team\u2019s first and so far only foray onto Steam. I\u2019d say they managed to offer an interesting game even if it never stands out really.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Gameplay<\/div>It\u2019s a coming-of-age type of story, at least at it\u2019s very beginning. Inner World\u2019s protagonist, is a shy and rather na\u00efve little boy named Robert. He starts this adventure like most video game heroes do, fulfilling errands. A less common element would be that you start by working for the game\u2019s main antagonist. The game\u2019s world, Asposia is a rather intricate fantasy realm in which a force of nature (in our case, wind itself) is used as a leitmotif. For an adventure that is also addressed to younger audiences, Inner World contains satire and pop culture references that will amuse older gamers. As far as its storyline is concerned, this title won\u2019t disappoint. Especially if you\u2019re accustomed to 2D adventures and you can imagine just what sort of odd characters you shall interact with. The other almost classic features of the genre, such as the inventory system and dialogue options are under a familiar interface with the occasional mixing of two components, in order to create another one. <br><br>What I found intriguing was that even wild combinations seem to work and even when they don\u2019t, you still receive an Achievement for trying. A nice touch indeed, from the developers. Story seems long enough, since I\u2019ve only seen a small part of the map so far. A minor complaint from me, would be related to the way all the in-game items you collect seem to blend in so well with the scenery. You really have to keep an eye out for them and click on every little nook and cranny.<br><br>The beautiful hand drawn locations and characters clearly show the efforts undertaken by the devs in order to separate from similar titles. And from the artwork perspective, I\u2019d say they accomplished that. Voice acting is more than decent, both in English and in the game\u2019s original language, German. I stuck with English dubs and subs and found no typos or mispronunciations so far. Worth mentioning as well, is the musical score which I found particularly soothing and proper.<br> <br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Pros<\/div>+ Original storyline, filled with humor<br>+ Intuitive puzzles and a comprehensive hint system<br>+ Steam Achievements &amp; Trading Cards<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Cons<\/div>- A few dialogues tend to drag on, thus slowing the story down<br>- Items blend in too well with the scenery<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Result \/ Final thoughts<\/div>If you\u2019re looking for a good fantasy adventure that won\u2019t strain you too much, you should give The Inner World a chance. Since it targets a large part of the gamer demographic, it\u2019s ideal even for a novice as well as a veteran of this genre. While I\u2019m not exactly okay with its pricing, I do realize that a lot of effort is being placed into such games, from concept art and down to the skilled voice actors.<br><br><b>Rating 7\/10<\/b><br> <br><blockquote class=\"bb_blockquote\">This review was submitted for <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/elitegives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >Elite Giveaways<\/a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.<\/blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('26470798', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '26470798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary26470798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '26470798' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary26470798\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '26470798', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26470798_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary26470798_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>4 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary17812282\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"23481495\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/b6\/b6510f3e1159be24ab47cce1c159f7a461a525ed_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/\" data-miniprofile=\"23481495\">TITOMOSQUITO187<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/games\/?tab=all\">1,101 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/\">50 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/titomosquito187\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">24.6 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: August 31, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA hilarious and adorable adventure game that I will remember fondly as one of my favorite point and click advetnures in some time. Phenomenal voice acting, cute characters, charming dialogue, good puzzles, and just an overall fun experience watching the characters try to save their people. <br><br>We begin with Robert, an orphaned boy who is being raised by a man named Conroy. Conroy is the ruler of this little world of Asposia, and right away, as you can in all animated tales, we realize that Conroy isn't the nicest of fellows. In fact, he seems like a downright meanie. :P One day while Robert is playing his flute nose (yes, I said flute nose) for Conroy in his favorite 1 note tune, a pigeon that Robert has been playing with as one of his only friends comes in and steals Conroy's necklace and flies off. Robert, being the ever dutiful 'son' goes after it and finds himself down in the city of Asposia with all the peasants for the first time outside the walls of Conroy's castle. His adventure is ready to begin...<br><br>Robert soon meets residents of Asposia and quickly starts to realize that Conroy may not be the great hero that he was raised to believe he was. Most importantly he meets Laura. A wanted thief, general troublemaker, obvious anti-establishment hero, and the girl of Robert's dreams. Robert is incredibly naive, but falls in love with Laura at first site. She is more worldy and they play off one another fantastically as she teases him and he shows his innocence again and again as a kind and generous boy. Their conversations are great, and Robert is pretty funny no matter how innocent he is. <br><br>I didn't find any issues with the game UI, or the puzzle mechanics. They are the standard hover over the bottom of the screen to pop up the item menu, with options to drag them to world objects, combine them, etc. Some of the puzzles are a bit strange and take some trial and error of jsut screwing aroudn finding what items interact with things, but overalll they aren't too illogical most of the time. The game has a few loading screens between areas that on my medium level PC took about 3 seconds to load wasn't a problem for me. <br><br>I had no bugs in the game that I can recall. Certainly nothing that made me stop, although the save system is not one that is the type to be friendly for Achievement hunters. The game can be saved manually, or using auto-saves, BUT you don't have a choice about where you save other than picking a slot for your current game. So you have one save and if it auto-saves and you miss an Achievement you will have to start the game over. So...if 100% Achievements is your goal then you better take a look at some Achievements guides BEFORE starting. There are a few that are full game achievements and a couple of them contradict. One side is really easy and can be gotten with a quick restart early on, but the other requires the full game to be played a certain way so you want to make sure you understand these early on before finding out halfway through you will have to play all the way through again.  <br><br>Game is probalby anywhere from 6-10 hours long. My playtime is longer because I left the game on for 12 hours one day. :)<br><br>If you are a fan of point and click adventure games, love games such as the ones made by Daedelic, love cute and adorable characters with phenomenal voice acting, then The Inner World is a fantastic game for you. While this is an Indie studio, and this is their first major game, I consider this adventure game to be as good as any of the Daedelic games I have played. It definitely could be considered as comparable in quality to those. I highly recommend it to any adventure fan. I loved the characters and would love to see more from this studio. <br><br>Bringing me to this...<br><br>NOTE: While looking at videos for The Inner World on Youtube I noticed this trailer from 2013 that suggested there might be an animated cartoon coming called 'The Inner World', but I ahve found no other news about it. I would have definitely watched, but it gives you a pretty good idea about the voice acting in the game as it is similar to this cartoon. If anyone knows anything else about this animated series I would be interested. :)<br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('17812282', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '17812282' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary17812282\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '17812282' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary17812282\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '17812282', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17812282_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary17812282_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20468604\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/42\/42d288d99d1f7bc80facc8850f04caed8d4bd5f2_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/\" data-miniprofile=\"40295010\">ownosourus<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/games\/?tab=all\">4,648 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/\">786 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ownosourus\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">15.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 11, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBig things can sometimes come in unassuming packages, and not all adventures have to feature innovative control schemes or frightening scare tactics. There is still plenty of room for traditional point-and-click games that impress by doing what\u2019s been done so often before, but doing it very well. The Inner World is that kind of game: a classic adventure whose hand-drawn, cartoony art style will appeal to young gamers, but whose humor, story, and puzzles will keep even veterans of the genre entertained as well. In short, it\u2019s a game that the entire family can truly enjoy together.<br><br>Speaking of big things in small packages, little Robert is a novice at the Wind Temple of Asposia and court musician to Abbott Conroy, its resident wind monk. Robert has spent his whole life sheltered under the watchful eye of Conroy, unaware of the dire straits his world finds itself in. You see, Asposia is a world within a world, surrounded on all sides by rock. Wind inexplicably entering through the three wind fountains has become the hidden world\u2019s life force; without it there's no light, and industry, trade, even Asposia\u2019s very existence would come to a grinding halt.<br><br>And wind is exactly what\u2019s running out. Years ago, the Basylians \u2013 angry wind gods who control the wind fountains \u2013 became displeased with the Asposians, and since then they\u2019ve been on a rampage, petrifying all they gaze upon while the wind fountains slowly dry up. Robert isn\u2019t the kind of hero to set out on a grand quest to save his world. Rather, he begins merely by chasing a thieving pigeon into a dirty, trash-choked back alley. Before long, he meets the charismatic Laura, a girl searching for her missing father. Following the cryptic clues he left behind for her, Laura not only believes that her father is still alive somewhere, but that he holds the key to discovering a secret wind fountain. Initially an unwilling participant, Robert is pulled into a tale of civil unrest in his own coming-of-age adventure. And if he plays his cards right, he just might learn how to save the world and impress the girl in the process.<br><br>Studio Fizbin, newcomer to the adventure scene, has crafted a charming, player-friendly experience. The game sports high presentation values, chiefly in its hand-drawn animation resembling Saturday morning TV cartoons. It eschews realism for a stylized fantasy world filled with creatures that draw their inspiration straight from a child\u2019s storybook. Most resemble crosses between two animals, like the tumble mice that look like miniature-sized sheep, or the monkey-like wooloofs. Even the Asposians themselves sport an imaginative look, their distinguishing feature a striped, pointed nose \u2013 all but Robert, whose nose is plain and lined with holes, allowing him to play it like a flute. Playing as Robert, you\u2019ll have a chance to explore the throne room of Conroy\u2019s castle, brave the dangers of  a trap-laden root forest, find an underground laboratory, and uncover the secret of the lost wind fountain.<br><br>Along with the clean, colorful art style comes painless navigation and an easy-to-use inventory system. Mousing over an object brings up clickable options, generally things like \u201cLook\u201d, \u201cTake\u201d or \u201cTalk to\u201d. The inventory, popping up when the cursor approaches the bottom of the screen, is unobtrusive; click and drag an item where you\u2019d like to use it, or onto another object to combine them. Items in your inventory, as well as possible dialog options during conversations, are visually represented by button-like picture icons. Holding the mouse button down will cause all on-screen hotspots to appear, avoiding the need for pixel hunting and making it a snap to find any vital items you may have missed previously. <br><br>The audio is equally pleasant, with a catchy title theme that perfectly fits the fantastical world, followed by equally good music throughout the game. Voice acting, however, is more of a mixed bag. Most characters sound fine, like Abbott Conroy\u2019s gruff, authoritative baritone and the plucky, rebellious attitude of Laura, Robert's partner in stirring up civil unrest \u2013 wanted for such crimes as chewing gum in public. Several minor characters also work flawlessly, and the narrator\u2019s smooth solemnity was a great choice. On the other hand, a few characters get decidedly too much game-time, their voices grating on the nerves, like Detze, a little boy with the painfully obvious adult male falsetto. The most unfortunate voiceover comes from Robert himself; while his flaccid, wispy lack of authority seems fitting at first, it quickly becomes tedious as even describing objects in the environment sounds like an overwhelming task for him.<br><br>Perhaps one of the only turn-offs of the game is the sheer amount of dialog to slog through. Not that there are walls of text, but most dialog options require upwards of three or four separate clicks to exhaust completely. Most of these conversations deliver a bit of comedy, fill in some backstory, or simply offer some light-hearted flavor. But anyone who would like to get to the point without starting the same conversation four separate times may get impatient. <br><br>The Inner World's gameplay does not attempt any innovation, relying instead on the tried-and-true, point-and-click formula. However, the complexity of the inventory puzzles ramps up quite significantly after the first chapter or two, providing a gentle learning curve early on but keeping things challenging in later chapters. Even with their increased difficulty, the puzzles remain logical, and can always be solved with a minimum of trial and error.<br><br>I quite enjoyed the creativity the designers employed in implementing the puzzles. In one scene it becomes clear that Robert needs to bake something. A recipe is easily procured, but finding an oven, making it work, and gathering suitable ingredients proves to be quite a bit more challenging, involving a solution spread out over various screens, gathering and using other items in unconventional ways in order to finally succeed. Of course, without staples such as flour or sugar, one truly has to think outside the box to make this work.<br><br>Though each chapter consists of no more than a handful of locations, there are a surprising number of tasks in each segment that must be accomplished before proceeding. Each area typically has a clear goal to accomplish, apparent from the beginning of the chapter, whether unlocking a specific door, retrieving a valuable item, or stopping a piece of machinery. Very few situations, however, have a quick solution. If anything, it feels overwhelming on occasion trying to figure out where to begin sorting through the mess of tasks at hand; sometimes simply discovering what obstacle I was supposed to overcome was enough to set me on the path to resolving it. This was the only time I was ever forced to resort to the hint system.<br><br>Overall, The Inner World is a stylish old-school, point-and-click adventure, and savoring the world and all its little details should provide plenty of play time. It doesn\u2019t break any new ground \u2013 nor does it ever seek to \u2013 but what it does it does well. Puzzles are a highlight, advancing in complexity from simple to vexing, and the world itself is sure to become a favorite locale to many who visit it. Warm and colorful, the characters have a way of growing on you, and even some spotty voice acting proves more of an annoyance than a game breaker. If games steeped in darkness and shadows are your thing, or if you\u2019re looking for a fast-paced thrill ride, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if a leisurely coming-of-age tale with a bit of humor for the whole family sounds good, you may well want to take the trip to Asposia. You're very likely to enjoy your stay, and that's not just a lot of hot air.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20468604', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20468604' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20468604\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20468604' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20468604\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20468604', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20468604_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20468604_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary15031332\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043885600\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"83619872\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a920dfbd7465f536481e565d715179a2b52e24a1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a920dfbd7465f536481e565d715179a2b52e24a1.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/a9\/a920dfbd7465f536481e565d715179a2b52e24a1_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043885600\/\" data-miniprofile=\"83619872\">Sein<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043885600\/games\/?tab=all\">114 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043885600\/recommended\/\">2 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198043885600\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.0 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: March 24, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was a big surprise for me.

It's not a mind-blowing experience by any means, but it's definitely not bad either. You play as a guy named Robert who finds himself thrust into a quest to save the world (naturally). Robert is a very naive and unassuming sort of fella, so a lot of the plot and humor centers around his clueless innocence. The story and dialogue is fairly good for the most part, in turns charming, funny and dark. The voice acting is hit or miss, though - mostly it is decent, but a few lines here and there are inexplicably bad (wrong pronunciations, improper emphasis of words, etc). Mechanically, the game also has its ups and downs. Being a point and click game, you would think that the pointing and clicking would be spot-on, but that's not always the case. Sometimes you can't click on things that you should be able to click (though it usually fixes itself in a second or two). Additionally, half of the achievements don't seem to be working properly. However, the developers have started to release patches to fix some of these problems, so a lot of these things may not be issues in the future. Regardless, none of these faults are deal breakers by any means, anyways. <br><br>The puzzles are fairly standard in adventure game terms. You basically just go around talking to people, picking up objects, and using those objects (or combinations thereof) to solve puzzles and progress further. Thankfully, none of the solutions are overly ridiculous or unintuitive (as is the case with many adventure games), though you will need to really think some stuff through from time to time. Apparently there is also a help system in place if you need it (which I didn't even realize until after finishing the game), so you probably won't ever get stuck for long, if you even get stuck at all. The game is divided into 5 chapters, each of which consists of a self-contained series of puzzles that take place on 3 or 4 &quot;screens&quot;. Playtime is probably around 7-8 hours or so, give or take. So keep that in mind in terms of how much you are willing to pay. All in all, the game is pretty good. As I said earlier, it is nothing mind-blowing for the genre, but it's a nice experience while it lasts. Probably the worst thing I could say about it (aside from the minor glitches noted above) is that the pacing is very slow. The dialogue in particular seems like it takes foreeeeeeeever sometimes, especially with a main character who is so low-key and slow. The pace may test your patience at times. But if you don't mind that and are into classic adventure games, this is probably worth a look at some point. I would probably recommend waiting for a sale, though, unless you are hardcore into adventure games and need something new to play now.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('7362356', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '7362356' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary7362356\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '7362356' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary7362356\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '7362356', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7362356_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary7362356_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"commentCount\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">2 <\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary20515107\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"75389846\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/9b\/9b6865bc458c8f97121f0deca49cbdd8fb408f86_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/\" data-miniprofile=\"75389846\">Stefneh<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/games\/?tab=all\">959 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/\">124 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Stefneh\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product activated via Steam key\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_key.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\">8.5 hrs on record<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: January 13, 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA really interesting game! This one might be a little long, sorry guys!<br><br>I tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.<br><br>The tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.<br><br>In ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!<br><br>Admittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.<br><br>The story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.<br><br>In terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian. <br><br>The graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing\/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the &quot;end of chapter&quot; cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game. <br>I found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.<br><br>That being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!<br>The help system in this  is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of &quot;Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this&quot;.<br><br>Lastly, achievements!<br>This one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it. <br>I basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements. <br>The chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds. <br>There is one lonesome guide for this game that details &quot;missable achievements&quot; you can either read the names\/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)<br>Also, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice. <br><br>All in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you. <br><br><br>TL;DR :  It's great, seriously. The story is inventive, it's fun and humorous. If you are a fan of the genre then definitely try it. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20515107', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20515107' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20515107\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20515107' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20515107\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20515107', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20515107_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20515107_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"header\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentsummary7439196\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"avatar\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971532050\/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"playerAvatar offline\" data-miniprofile=\"11266322\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5ef479f38157a39cba515809b3f6fa43ce97f70a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5ef479f38157a39cba515809b3f6fa43ce97f70a.jpg 1x, http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steamcommunity\/public\/images\/avatars\/5e\/5ef479f38157a39cba515809b3f6fa43ce97f70a_medium.jpg 2x\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971532050\/\" data-miniprofile=\"11266322\">Conditional Love<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_owned_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971532050\/games\/?tab=all\">663 products in account<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"num_reviews\"><a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971532050\/recommended\/\">190 reviews<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rightcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197971532050\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"vote_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title ellipsis\">Recommended<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: October 20, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA quirky cartoonish adventure game in the classic adventure game style.<br><br>Backgrounds are lovely, Character Art is cartoonish but nice.

Asposia runs on wind, but only wind fountain out of the original three in Asposia is still functioning, so the lights are going out and the residents will soon suffocate. Also, there are attacks from the wind gods, who petrify anyone deemed &quot;immoral.&quot; Robert gets unwillingly pulled along for the ride. It's a great story with some interesting puzzles.<br><br>Pros:<br>+ Great story and worldbuilding. Very unique.<br>+ Good humor. Robert is adorable and sheltered, leading to some hilarious situations like him not understanding sexual innuendo or is naive enough to believe a holy man when he claims that he's &quot;meditating&quot; while at a slot machine. There are lots of other fun characters, like helpless researchers and blockheaded guards.<br>+ Decent music. Not super memorable, but good at setting a mood and not intrusive or annoying.<br><br>Neutral:<br>~ Generally fun puzzles, but there were a few that were annoying because they involve combining a bunch of non-related items to solve a puzzle, and it's not obvious what you're making until it's finished. Having the &quot;A-ha!&quot; moment AFTER you've built a thing is definitely the wrong order.<br><br>Con:<br>- Game is a bit buggy. I had a game-breaking bug in the last chapter, but fortunately, there are save game files available in the Steam community for all the chapters. Also, you have to have Adobe Air up to date or the game will freeze after every cut scene.<br><br>Overall: 8\/10. It's a fun game, and definitely worth a play if you like adventure games.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30804390', 'recent_short' );

is a point &amp; click adventure from Germany that is suitable for and recommended to beginners and lovers of adventure games.<br>Its story takes place in Asposia, a world that mostly lives from wind and light but suffers under its dictator Conroy. His adopted son - or should I better say &quot;slave&quot; - is the protagonist and by accident he stumbles out of the palace he has lived all his life and begins an adventure which will make him discover the outside world, love and some (ugly) truths.<br><br>This point &amp; click adventure is easy to control and to understand. The way you select your items and go through dialogues (all displayed with symbols) is similar to &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road&quot; (thus also playable for illiterates by the way).<br>So your main task is to progress in the story by talking to characters, finding items and combining them with other things. You can't die in the game or get yourself into dead ends. <br>The difficulty level is fine, the puzzles aren't child friendly-easy but also not too hard. However, as in classics like several LucasArts adventures or &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; you definitely need to think laterally a lot in order to progress. So it's still challenging here and there. If you're still stuck, there is an in-game help but I personally don't know if it's good (I never used it).<br><br>What makes the game for me is this universe and its culture you're introduced to, the story and its main character. It's a game full of charme and a good dose of humour. However, the further you get the darker the story feels which is also pretty cool. Even though you can't die in the game you experience more and more traces of darkness, dictatorship, superstition and threats in this world. That's when the humour comes handy and brings extra charme to the game. And as for the characters, especially Robert is great here thanks to his naive but optimistic nature, his design and his English voice actor Mike McAlpine.<br><br>Speaking of, let's quickly talk about the graphics and sound.<br>The animations are or are like digital Flash animation. It's not glamourous graphics but the cartoon style is original and likeable, you can connect to those Asposians and the other creatures very well (at least I can). Original is also the character design. The backgrounds look more detailed and not only that, they look beautiful. Also despite of the cartoonish style it's never in too bright colours, the colours are actually quite subtle.<br>The soundtrack is very nice. So nice though that I purchased the soundtrack DLC after finishing the game. It's beautiful and serves a lot of the game's atmosphere. When it comes to voices you can choose between the German and the English language. Even though the game's from Germany and so am I, I personally prefer the English version. I just like chosen voices there better, especially Robert's voice (as mentioned before).<br><br>Are there things I don't like in &quot;The Inner World&quot;? Just a few minor things that never seriously destroy the game. <br>There are little flaws in the animation (people who have created vector graphics in general or flash animation may know what I mean). Also I wished that the world of Asposia had at least more background characters. Most of the time it looks like you save a world that's barely populated at all (and yes, I know, why a certain amount of people are gone but still...).<br><br>What about extras? Well, there's a &quot;Play Flute-Nose&quot; option in the main menu which allows you to play Robert's nose as a flute \u00e0 la &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; (react to the music by pressing certain buttons in the right moments). I haven't played this often because it's not that great for me but if you enjoy this kind of music game or a bonus mini game in general, you might like this.<br>There are also Steam achievements and trading cards. <br><br>So: Do I recommend &quot;The Inner World&quot;? Yes, definitely, if you enjoy adventure games.<br>Personally I enjoyed it very much. I don't consider this one of the greatest adventures ever but it's still very good and since I know that there's a sequel game coming in summer 2017, I'm so looking forward to it and can't wait to play it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('30244946', 'recent_short' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '30244946' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent_short30244946\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '30244946' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent_short30244946\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '30244946', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30244946_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent_short30244946_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review_box short\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div id=\"ReviewContentrecent_short29914789\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/hijiinx\/recommended\/251430\/\" class=\"short_header tooltip\" data-tooltip-content=\"See Full Review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"review_source tooltip\"  data-tooltip-content=\"Product purchased directly from Steam\" src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_review_steam.png\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/store.akamai.steamstatic.com\/public\/shared\/images\/userreviews\/icon_thumbsUp_v6.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"persona_name\"><span data-miniprofile=\"44761267\">Hijiinx<\/span><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hours ellipsis\"> 5.5 hrs<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"shortcol\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postedDate\">Posted: February 13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI went into this game hopeful, but also with lower expecations (if that makes any sense at all).

Its <b>story<\/b> is set in the fantasy world of Asposia. Asposia is a world surrounded by earth. Air is blown into Asposia through only a few large holes. Each of these holes is guarded by a wind monk. Robert lives in a wind monastery with one of the wind monks. He's treated like a doormat and has never left the monastery. By accident, he plunges through a garbage chute and finds himself in a world he knows very little of. What will he discover?<br><br>The <b>graphics<\/b> of <i>The Inner World<\/i> are hand-drawn and cartoonish in style. The world of Asposia looks pretty nice and full of life. The characters look ugly but that's a style the developers chose. I'm sure they didn't think they created the most beautiful animated characters ever, but they consciously chose a simple, cartoonish look for their characters, which fits the world and the story they wanted to show us.<br><br>The game is German in origin but the way it was transitioned to the English version is impressive. This shows in two major ways:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The <b>voice acting<\/b> is top-notch. The voice actor of Robert, the protagonist, manages to capture Robert's innocense and naivety perfectly.<br><\/li><li> The <b>humour<\/b> did not get lost in translation, as is often the case. <i>The Inner World<\/i> is even genuinely funny at times. It's not often that a computer game can make me laugh out loud a couple of times, and makes me giggle a few more times on top of that.<\/li><\/ul>The <b>difficulty<\/b> of <i>The Inner World<\/i> is challenging enough but the solutions to the puzzles are always logical, so the game never becomes frustratingly hard and it never makes you want to look up a walkthrough. To help you play through the game more easily, you can hold the mouse button to see all the objects Robert can interact with. Should you find yourself stumped, you can open a help menu and get a hint on what to do next. If you still don't know how to proceed, you can ask to get another hint. And so on, until the solution is pretty much spelled out to you.<br><br><i>The Inner World<\/i> has 7 <b>Steam Trading Cards<\/b>. You'll get 4 while running the game. Of the 23 <b>Steam Achievements<\/b> some are storybound and unmissable, but other achievements are optional and very much missable. These missable achievements show a lot of creativity on the developers' part, as they are often rewarded for trying out alternative solutions or at least experimenting with the items you collect and objects in the environment.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('29700654', 'recent_short' );
