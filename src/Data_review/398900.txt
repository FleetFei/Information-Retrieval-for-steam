Abilities can be light form, floating form, fire form or metal form. Noteworthy is also that the controllable marble ball is not a flipper ball that gets thrown around helplessly - instead the player has pretty good control over the ball plus ability to execute double or even triple jumps if executed correctly.  This results in the player jumping around pretty nimbly from one ledge to another yet evey now and then there are places where you need to do precise jumping - and the control over the marble ball allows the player to do just that. Rest be assured though if hard platformer games are not your tea as on average this game is more casual and based on overall mood rather than a true skill requiring game. <br><br>Level design is simple but good enough. Mostly ice caves, fire caves etc with switches and collectables.  Light is important in every level as you need to be able to see where you are going. Sometimes you need to flick switches to be able to see properly. <br><br>Soundtrack can be very moody or epic.  Certain songs reming me of Two Steps from Hell which is not a bad thing at all. <br><br>And how does this game compare to some other titles? Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball it is not. This does not require that much raw skill although certain levels may frustrate younger players.  Collisions and Nightsky -games are closer but this game has more control and does not get as frustrating. but may loose on better level design and challenge if that is what you want. <br><br>Game is mostly bug free. Only noticed a bug in the options menu where you tried to use both pad and mouse. it seems to confuse the game but it's easily overcome by using the mouse. Also a con i can think of is the lack of lore or proper in-game explanation on what you are doing and where you are going.  Game got the nice soundtrack so some spoken dialog or even text would have helped. Lacking details where there should be some would be perhaps the best explanation here. <br><br>I got this game for -50% but it's easily worth full price and for me the best purchase during this dreadful steam sale.  Try it out.  As long as you are able to get over the few slow levels early on then this game will start to shine quite quickly.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('20219783', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '20219783' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary20219783\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '20219783' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary20219783\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '20219783', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20219783_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary20219783_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/398900\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 1 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["20219783"]}
