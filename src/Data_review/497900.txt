I don't know... something seemed appealing about it... a show gone wrong basically. <br><br>So you have Kyle and Rachel, just two seemingly happy married people ready to start a family. He works in an office and she's an artist. They've had trouble conceiving in the past however this seems to be their lucky chance... and of course as the title implies \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hits the fan pretty quick. <br><br>From the start, even the first few moments these two just seemed destined to have a failed relationship from the get-go... I don't know... maybe it's the acting of the actors however I think naturally that's just the relationship between the characters... the usual tension with the mother-in-law and the man and his dog vs the wife (for good reason of that later on) and it all boils on through the movie until everything just kind of blows. <br><br>I think there was a nice progression as they wanted it to seem like (without forcing it as one) a &quot;this is what happened found footage film&quot;. The graphics where they tried to make it seem like the camera kept messing up were sometimes a little forced and the ending just felt rushed... I was really wanted a good scare out of the ending or even throughout the movie (one real jump scare and a few times I didn't want to look). But I think it did alright. <br><br>It's no real good scare honestly, but I think it's a nice little movie to pass the time. If you like found footage type movies or just like seeing a movie involving a haunting, you should check it out. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('24788530', 'summary' ); return false;\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text\">Was this review helpful?<\/span>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( '24788530' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnsummary24788530\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"><\/i> Yes<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( '24788530' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnsummary24788530\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"><\/i> No<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( '24788530', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24788530_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnsummary24788530_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"><\/i> Funny<\/span><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"rightcol recent_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear:left;\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ViewAllReviewssummary\" class=\"view_all_reviews_btn leftcol\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/497900\/reviews\/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_\">Browse all 2 reviews<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n","dayrange":30,"recommendationids":["24788530"]}
