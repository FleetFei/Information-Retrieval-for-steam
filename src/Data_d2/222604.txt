							The vast number of SD70 diesel locomotives produced since the early 1990s has seen the Class become one of the most popular diesel models seen on the US rail network, and the SD70M is now available for Train Simulator in Southern Pacific livery.Production of the SD70 series commenced in late 1992, although production of the SD70M ceased in late 2004 when they were placed with the SD70M-2. Despite this, the locomotives were capable of a high haulage weight and were produced in large quantities, with more than 1,600 entering service for a number of US railroads, as well as overseas customers.
