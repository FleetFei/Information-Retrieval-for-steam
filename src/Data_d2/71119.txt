							About This Game
							I am David Lander, swordsman in the service of the great King Frederick of Whitewood.
						A few days ago, I was sent by my lord to an audience with King Weeden of this land of Green Row. Trembling, King Weeden informed me that his townspeople have been disappearing daily. Neither the astrological charts nor even the king’s own oracle can explain. Green Row has always been a safe and charming land. Not any longer. I must find out what is happening to King Weeden’s people, and return them.
