							With the new product series OMSI 2 - Download Pack, Halycon Media starts a new series of add-ons for the popular OMSI 2 - Omnibus-Simulator. In the first part, we provide you with more than 30 different AI vehicles for the existing OMSI maps.Ranging from small to middle-sized cars, from transporters across ambulances to various kinds of trucks â€“ all in up to 20 different colours. The choice of models corresponds to many vehicle models of famous car manufacturers from all over the world. There are many models you can see in German traffic every day, but rare vehicles are not missing either in this add-on.In order to maintain game speed as much as possible despite the addition of more AI vehicles, all 3D models were graphically optimised and adapted. These vehicles have not been used in any commercial OMSI 2 Map / AddOn so far. They are new models and variations.With the OMSI 2 Download Vol. 1 AI Vehicles, maps get a contemporary and realistic look, which makes for traffic exerience close to real life.Featuresmore than 30 different AI vehiclescorresponding vehicle types of known car manufacturersmodern cars, vans and trucksvehicles with different repaints/coloursfor implementation in existing mapsperformance-optimised 3D modelsPlease note:Further distribution of the vehicles in the OMSI 2 Download Pack Vol. 1, whether individually or together with free maps, is not allowed for reasons of copyright.
