							The four-axle, 2,000 horsepower GP38-2 road switcher was part of EMD’s Dash 2 series of locomotives in the 1970s, and is now available for Train Simulator in BNSF ‘pumpkin’ and BN green liveries.More than 2,200 GP38-2 locomotives were built by General Motors’ Electro-Motive Division in the USA and General Motors Diesel in Canada between January 1972 and July 1986, designed for use as a road switcher but equally adaptable to hauling trains on the mainline.The GP38-2 worked across the entire USA for many now fallen flag railroads and current Class 1 railroads, as well as in Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. As a part of General Motors’ ‘Dash 2’ locomotive category, the model was an upgrade to the earlier GP38, with new CTC controls, equipped radios and dynamic brakes some of the new features.Such was the popularity and reliability of the GP38-2s, many can still be seen on railroads around the USA, mainly working freight yards but with some a common sight on passenger services, particularly as double-headed units.The GP38-2 for Train Simulator is available in BNSF ‘pumpkin’ orange and black livery and Burlington Northern green livery.
