							About This Game
							Humanity Asset is a Metroid-style 3D platformer that pays homage to the traditional retro classic shoot ‘em up genre.  

Aliens have invaded Earth to strip the planet of its resources, to save their own dying planet. As in all classic shoot 'em ups, only you can save the day - now there’s a surprise!

With 16 levels, over 400 stages and a multitude of awesome weapons, you must hack, slash and shoot your way to survival and victory.
