							About This Game
							Suit up, boys! The battleground is open and danger has never been more real. Enemies lurk at every turn, their trigger fingers just itching for the opportunity to take you out. Once the mask drops, be ready to pull the trigger. 
Masked Shooters 2 puts you on the front line of a dangerous gunfight that can only end in victory or defeat; there will be no white flags to wave. As a covert ops soldier, you have access to advanced weapons that will blow your enemies away, if you know how to use them. From a pistol and sniper rifle to a grenade launcher and RPG, your arsenal is packed for a maximum kill rate, but it won’t be easy. Enemies have their own weaponry and your ammo is limited, so make every bullet count. 

From detailed graphics to life-like sound, this first person shooter game has everything you need if you enjoy adrenaline pumping, fast-paced gameplay. Choose to join a team or show off your sniping skills in free for all mode, where it’s you against the world. You can play offline against pitiless AI soldiers or join a room online to play against others in real time for a true test of your skill. There’s only one answer in Masked Shooters: it’s time to lock and load.
