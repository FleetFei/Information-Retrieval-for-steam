							About This Game
							No, not that kind of party. 						Lately Castle Aldrheim produced these robes for wizards who like to travel in a group. Whether they quest, grind raid or duel in the arenas, these robes are sure to give the group an edge. Only a wizard that trusts his “friends” would bring a Party Robe to a duel.						Tank Robe can take a lot of punishment and help his “friends” get an upper hand on the situation.						Rogue Robe is mostly nowhere to be seen in a fight, but now and then, he strikes from the shadows.						Support Robe makes sure his groups spellcasting is at its best.
