							Bulleid coaches were introduced by Southern in the 1940s by the Chief Mechanical Engineer O.V.S Bulleid. Bulleid coaches pass a lot of their design on the British Rail Mk1 coaches build during the 1950s but are recognisable by the small window above the droplight in the door.These coaches represent the Tavern coaches based on a Country pub with traditional pub signs. These coaches were later rebuilt into more traditional coaches.The Bulleid Coach Pack 03 for TS Marketplace includes the following coach types in Southern Green, BR Crimson and Cream and BR Coaching stock Green livery:Tavern CarTavern Car (Rebuilt)Tavern TrailerTavern Trailer (Rebuilt)
