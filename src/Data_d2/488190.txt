							This is the complete C++ source code for Crongdor the Barbarian, version 1.4.
It compiles with Clang or GCC. It will build with Visual Studio but you
will need to download or build appropriate library files for MSVC.

We plan to incrementally add commentary, critical review ("post-mortem"), and
tutorials related to this code over the coming months, based on demand. OpenGL
students are usually curious how larger projects can be managed, so this should
be interesting as /one/ way to do that.
