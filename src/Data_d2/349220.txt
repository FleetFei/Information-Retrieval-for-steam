							About This Game
							Warning:This is not your typical game: The Black Watchmen is unlike any other game on Steam. You will have the opportunity to complete tasks unique to PARGs. You must be prepared: There is no virtual world, and you have no in-game avatar. You have an agent name, your wits, and the support of the community, that is all. The game exists in the real world, and many times during missions you will be interacting with real world entities (players, businesses, organizations, etc.).You will not be able to complete this game alone. Only with the help of the community will you be able to rise through the ranks, and become a veteran agent of The Black Watchmen.PricingYou are buying Season 1, which gives you access to:25 in-game missions65 puzzles to solve5 hidden missions (unlocked by obtaining “puzzle pieces” or secret answers in-game)Community sandbox missionsSeason 2 is an optional DLC and includes: 30 in-game missions featuring an expanded narrative82 puzzles to solve5 new hidden missionsThe World of The Black WatchmenThe Black Watchmen are a paramilitary group dedicated to protecting the public from dangerous phenomena beyond human understanding: ritualistic murder, occult secret societies, and paranormal activity, to name but a few.As a global organization, The Black Watchmen offer a wide range of skills and services for covert missions anywhere in the world, on behalf of any group, corporation or government that can afford them. Often called in as a last resort, The Black Watchmen pride themselves on their discretion, strength and efficiency.To maintain objectivity in the field, you, as an agent, are never informed of the identity of the client. You are given only mission parameters and told how to distinguish friend from foe, but the lines are often blurred…Gameplay OverviewA traditional video game has clear parameters - it is played on a screen, within a virtual world, and exists solely within that space. A PARG (Permanent Alternate Reality Game), like The Black Watchmen, uses the real world as its game world, blurring the lines between fiction and reality, turning everyday interactions into game mechanics.Gameplay FeaturesGameplay: Different missions require different skill-sets.Crack ancient codes and investigate bizarre occurrencesJoin a squadron of soldiers raiding a rupture siteHack through the virtual defenses of your enemiesResearch an occult group and uncover hidden connectionsAll Around You: The game is played using coded websites, wikis and real world references.Mission Hub: An interface that acts as a hub for information, mission briefings, puzzles, and more.Agent Map: See the locations of your fellow agents around the world, and keep an eye out for potential location-based missions.
