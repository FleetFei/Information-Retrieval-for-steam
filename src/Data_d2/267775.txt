Do you have the courage to plunge into the darkness and confront its perils? Legends say that in the deepest pits of this abyss, the Lord of Darkness stands watch over a vast treasure that even includes a portal that leads to the renowned Crown of Command!

The Dungeon adds a new Region to the game for heroes to explore and over 100 new cards bring this subterranean realm vividly to life. Five brand-new characters – the formidable Gladiator, noble Amazon, dashing Swashbuckler, enigmatic Gypsy, and sagacious Philosopher all offer fantastic new playing experiences.
