To make things even more awkward, Red Deck 2 comes complete with its own set of equally offensive Location (Blue) and Scenario (Purple) cards.The Red Deck 2 expansion deck comes complete with new Achievements, Titles, and Art to unlock!Once added to SUPERFIGHT, The Red Deck 2 will be added to your Collection and can be selected when joining fights.
