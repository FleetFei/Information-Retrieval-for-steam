							Fatal Experiments is a collection of three independent 1920's adventures for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. Two of the three scenarios are suitable for both beginning and experienced players, making this book a perfect companion for first-time buyers of the Call of Cthulhu game system. The remaining adventure is unusually dangerous -- to be played only by experienced, foolhardy investigators.Requires: Call of Cthulhu rulesetConverted by: Colin Richardson
