							About This Game
							Bliss is a quiet and subtle puzzle platforming adventure. 

Always searching for what he didn't have; the man climbed a mountain his entire life just to find himself alone at the top with a view of all the mistakes he made along the way.

In Bliss you are a shadow trapped in a strange world constructed from someone's memories. The world is infected with dark creatures that you have to remove before you can proceed. To your disposal you have a boomerang and a stopwatch that can freeze time. 

Each level represents a period of a certain person's life as well as a stage in the KÃ¼bler Ross model (the five stages of grief).
