							About This Series
							The first season of "Con Man" introduces Wray Nerely (Alan Tudyk), a cult science fiction actor who is stuck in a rut and feels trapped by the pigeonhole that SPECTRUM, his most popular project to date, has put him in. As he navigates the world of fan conventions and all of the surreal experiences that go along with them, Wray tries to land a serious role that will win him the respect he so desperately craves. On one end of the spectrum is a possible Clint Eastwood western. On the other end of the spectrum is, well, SPECTRUM the movie, much to Wray's dismay.
