							The Robbers Tool Kit offers a wealth of new crazy weapons and upgrades, accompanied by a number of different shop items that are instantly unlocked for you. To top it off there are 2 new maps per game mode.

Find yourself stranded on a Container Ship, not only battling against your fellow robbers, but also fighting against the swaying ship as it travels through the unpredictable ocean waves. The Parking Lot offers a new and interactive environment. Move the trollies to stop an incoming snow ball, or simply run around one to deny your opponents from robbing your dollars.

You’ll be blown away by the Cluster Bomb, Musket, Beer Cans or any of the other new weapons, not forgetting the customization items like the Samurai’s Beard and the Fu Man Chu found within the Tool-Kit. Are you excited? We know the Robbers are!
