							This will unlock the fourth released main story route of Mystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons, focusing on the character Takumi Arai. "I'll find your mother and find out what happened to Yasu. I swear on my life, I will."Rejecting the path set before her by Professor Kazama, Tsubasa turns to her childhood friend Takumi for help in finding her mother – an enigma directly tied to Takumi’s brother, Yasu. Despite being targeted by an all-powerful vampire mafia, the pair follows the faint trails of evidence, spending night after night in the underworld unraveling secrets. But even as Tsubasa and Takumi start to learn about each other again, they begin to realize that they’re becoming corrupted under the shadow of the red-light district, Yoru. With Takumi battling his inadequacy as a human detective in a supernatural world, and Tsubasa struggling with her powerful but out-of-control abilities, is this one mystery they can solve without losing each other – or themselves?Note: Story content may not be suitable for all audiences.Features:Experience a different kind of love story with a balance between dark and light themes, and a strong emphasis on fantasy and action.
