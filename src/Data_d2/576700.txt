There is not a single living human in the dimly lit facility where you remain trapped. From these settings, you'll have to escape, to get out of this place. During that journey you may learn what happened to you, and what went on in here.However, despite there not being a single other human besides yourself in the building, you are not alone...WHAT HOLLOW HALLS IS:- Story based atmospheric horror game- Exploring and investigating- Light and medium level environmental puzzlesWHAT HOLLOW HALLS IS NOT:- Jump-scare-fest- Zombie-shooter-gameGENERAL INFORMATION:Gameplay consists of exploration, solving puzzles and piecing together the story of what happened inside this complex where you are trapped and what happened to you and why are you trapped in here. The ultimate goal, achieved by puzzle-solving and navigating, in the game is to escape the abandoned facility. Saving the game not allowed.This game was highly inspired by the classic 90's survival horror games. However, this game has no combat or survival mechanics whatsoever and your only method of surviving is trying to escape the enemy. Likewise the length of this game is understandably nowhere near those games. I chose to rather keep it shorter and tighter than trying to artificially lengthen it, which would have only resulted in a leaned out and milder experience. On the delivery of the horror theme, I chose to leave out all the jump-scares and opted for constant oppressing and dark atmosphere.Photosensitivity warning: This game contains couple of flashing lights. If you are at risk of having epileptic seizure, you might want to take that into consideration.
