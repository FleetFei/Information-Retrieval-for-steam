							Embraerâ€™s 145LR is a 50 passenger variant of the Brazilian Embraer Regional Jet (ERJ) line-up. Launched at the Paris Air Show in 1989, the 145LR was intended to offer greater speed and comfort than the turboprop aircraft typically in use at the time. The LR suffix indicates a long-range variant with increased fuel capacity. The turbofan engines are controlled by Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADECs) which monitor numerous engine functions, all of which have been authentically replicated in the FSX: Steam Edition incarnation of this beautiful aircraft.The 145LR for FSX: Steam Edition, from FeelThere, includes a separate configuration tool used to customize the way you fly your aircraft.
