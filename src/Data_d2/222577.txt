							The fans’ favourite EMD SD40-2 is now available for Train Simulator, bringing this classic model to the US locomotive stable in two striking liveries –BNSF Heritage and Burlington Northern.More than 4,000 SD40-2 models were built by General Motors’ Electro-Motive Division between 1972 and 1989 as part of the company’s Dash 2 series and an upgrade from the original SD40. The new version included an updated 3,000 horsepower, turbocharged 16 cylinder diesel-electric engine, with some external updates including longer front and rear ‘porches’ and an additional roof-mounted radiator grill.The model was capable of a 65mph top speed with standard fitted gearing and several variations appeared during its 17 year build history, including the SD40T-2 with tunnel motor, SD20-2W with a four window safety cab, a high nose version and even a narrow gauge version, the BB40-2. General Motors also used the SD40-2 chassis to build the Class 59 in the UK, which was fitted with a unique body design specifically for European railway markets.The EMD SD40-2 for Train Simulator is available in BNSF pre and post-2005 heritage liveries, and Burlington Northern pre and post-merger liveries. Features of the model include cab lighting, step lights and dynamic braking.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the EMD SD40-2 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
