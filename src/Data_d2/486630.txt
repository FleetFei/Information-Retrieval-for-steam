							About This Game
							You're trapped deep within the toxic sewers. It's a dangerous place and you have to think quickly in order to survive.

Grab all of the keys in a level to open the door to freedom... or at least the next level.

The Count and Countess have sent their minions and set up traps to stop you. You are defenseless and one touch is fatal. Good luck with that!
