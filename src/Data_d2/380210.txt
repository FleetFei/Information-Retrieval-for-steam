							About This Game
							Signal to Noise is a music-driven action game. However, that does not mean it is a typical rhythm game. Taking inspiration from some of the greatest classic games ever made, it's a high-octane hardcore rail shooter first and foremost that just so happens to build itself in front of your eyes from any music you play.

Analyzing more audio components than any music-driven game before, Signal to Noise pieces together your experience based on the dynamics, pitch and tempo of your chosen track, interpreting it phrase-by-phrase and crafting your experience on the fly. Enemies, power-ups and the arenas themselves act differently each time you play a new tune. The game supports any audio file or playlist, and can even be played at live music events.

Designed by passionate classic gamers, this game has what could be the strongest focus of any modern game on what made point-pressing and competitive high score play in classic arcade games so strategically deep and satisfying. With an understanding of this type of play unrivaled elsewhere in independent games, Signal to Noise has been designed for the players with the greatest understanding of the game and greatest skill to come out on top in the leaderboards. Even still, while competitive play and depth of mechanics is a great focus of the design, the game is fun for everyone that likes music and video games!

Welcome to the next generation of music-driven and hardcore arcade gaming.
