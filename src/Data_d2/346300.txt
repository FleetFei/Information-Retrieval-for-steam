							About This Game
							A top-secret military research facility has gone dark.  Their last communication only had two words in it: “Containment Protocol”

Your task is to infiltrate the facility using a prototype remote control drone and work out what has happened to the facility and more importantly - what has happened to the weapon they were working on.

THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!

This means that it's not the full game, in fact the version that is currently uploaded is about 80% of what was available to play at Rezzed and on my Website. A large section of it has been re-designed.

You can play using WSAD or cursor keys to move around or even a JoyPad. Make sure the joypad is attached before you start the game as there is a bug where it won't be recognised if you plug it in after starting the game.
