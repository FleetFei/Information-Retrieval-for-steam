							About This Game
							Incoming goblins! Lead your bravest elfish warriors into the field and use the forces of nature to push the hordes of goblins, golems and ghosts back!

Gather your units for battle and brace yourself, because they are already on their way.

They are after the gold of the elves!

It is up to you to protect the gold and defend the land of the elves from the goblins.
Knife throwing elves and mages repulse the beastly attackers and mother nature itself is on your side as well. On your command bushes and trees will straggle, explosive mushrooms will grow everywhere and stones will form a blockade.

But until the goblin army is not defeated, their attacks will become more and more aggressive by every assault.
If you are overrun, you may use ancient elfish magic to summon lightning and fire upon your enemy.

Skill, a sense for tactics and a fast mind is everything you will need to defend the elfish kingdom.
