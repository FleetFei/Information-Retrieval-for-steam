							About This Game
							Earth is in the grips of a bitter cold war - nuclear armaments are armed and ready to fire should either East or West make a move. World leaders look to the skies for answers, and in a manner of speaking, an answer is found. An impossible mineral, a compound of elements that fits not into our understanding of the universe, has been discovered in the deepest reaches of space. 

This impossible mineral begins to revolutionize technology - first being developed into weapons in order to control the spaces in which the compound can be found. But neither side wants to see the other gain control over supply. 

A distant solar-system. A fight for the survival of billions. That is where you come in.
