							Mesh Maker VR is an intuitive, easy to use, and easy to learn VR 3d modeling tool based on vertices. Nearly zero learning curve. Just hop into VR and start making 3d models.Current Features / ChangeLog Ability to change skybox from Settings (stars, blue sky, and sunset as the first three choices). - 4/1/2017 Eye dropper tool (Toosl -> Triangles -> Pick Color) - 3/28/2017 Triangle multi-select mode - 3/24/2017 Fill Tool (ability to color faces) - 3/23/2017 Sphere Primitives - 3/6/2017 Lock Reference Images - 3/3/2017 (allows placing vertices directly on reference image for easy extrusions) Cylinder Primitives - 2/28/2017 Circle Primitives - 2/22/2017 3d Tracing Mode - 2/3/2017 Box Select - 1/29/2017 Box Primitives - 1/27/2017 Selection Flip Normals - 1/27/2017 Extrude Face - 1/26/2017 Merge Vertices - 1/26/2017 Plane Primitives - 1/25/2017 Rotation Snapping - 1/25/2017 Multiselect & Copy/Paste - 1/22/2017 Reference Images - 1/16/2017 (top.png, bottom.png, left.png, right.png, front.png, back.png in same folder as executable) Alignment Tools - 1/16/2017 Object scaling for easy work positioning - 1/19/2017 Settings saved as JSON - 1/16/2017 Ability to adjust snap spacing from Settings - 1/8/2017 Wavefront OBJ Load/Save (no UI for load yet - loads "load.obj" on startup. Save has simple button in radial menu.) Vertex Create/Move/Delete Face Create/Delete/Flip Snapping for Vertex Create/Move Object rotation and movement for easy work positioning Teleporting for easy work positioningRoadmapFeatures will be implemented over time according to their priority. Urgent priority first, then High priority.Urgent priority: Extrude Along Normal button (locked extrusion axis) Hide snap 3d crosshair lines unless they hit something Make snap crosshair disappear when near Tool/Settings Panel "airspace" Edge extrusion Mirror/symmetry planeNote: completion of Urgent priority items will be followed by a $5 price increase.High priority: Better User Interface (UI) for Load/Save OBJ, including directory traversal Subdivide Proportional Editing ToolNote: completion of High priority items will be followed by a $5 price increase and officially end Early Access status.
