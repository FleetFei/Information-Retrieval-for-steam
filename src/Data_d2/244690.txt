							A moody tale that combines the intrigue and atmosphere of a Raymond Chandler novel or Humphrey Bogart film with classic point-and-click adventure gameplay, Face Noir follows private eye Jack Del Nero as heâ€™s falsely accused of murdering the man who left a little girl in his protection.

As Jack tries to figure out the identity of the girl and clear his name, the disillusioned detective finds himself up against a city infested with corruption and economic uncertainty. The more he uncovers, the more he discovers about the darker depths of human nature.
