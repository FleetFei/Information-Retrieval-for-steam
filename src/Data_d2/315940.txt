Now he has to to get it back. On his adventure the Hero will visit seven worlds, each one with his own graphic style. The hero will meet many kinds of NPCs:we will help a guy with lost wallet, drink many bottles of rum with a pirate captain, smoke some strange tobacco with an old guy in the desert and more!

Some are meant for killing and some for changing the game mechanics e.g. a platform gun, which shoots platforms, of course on which we can jump,a freeze gun which, of course, freezes our enemies.The game is meant to be hard and addictive, so if you were playing much on NES as a child it's a perfect choice for you.
