							Checkmate ends the game – that's an undeniable fact. Yet sometimes players who gleefully and unashamedly play for the attack are treated as a joke by their colleagues. Launching a successful attack is a skillful business that often demands great creativity. And like most themes in chess, this is a skill that can be honed and polished. In the second edition of the Power Play series, Grandmaster Daniel King looks at attacking play and asks what makes for a successful attack. 

Test your attacking and defensive skills by examining a series of specially selected test positions. The Power Play series is suitable for anyone looking to improve their chess, and provides ready-made lessons and exercises for a trainer.
