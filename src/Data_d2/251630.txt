							About This Game
							The super-addictive and very, very hard platform game finally arrives on Steam - it's quite possibly the world's hardest game!

With just one button, guide your orange square over spikes and jump onto blocks to get to the end of the level. Sounds easy? Any mistake results in instant death, sending you back to the beginning of the level. With an awesome soundtrack synced to the game you’ll quickly become addicted!

Try and unlock medals throughout the game, including beating the game with no flags — all synced up with Steam Achievements — and use checkpoints to learn the levels with Practice Mode, allowing you to lay checkpoints along the way. 

As well as five classic Impossible Game levels, this desktop version includes an EXCLUSIVE new Level Editor. Design your own near-impossible levels and send them over the internet to challenge the world!
