							About This Game
							Shrug Island Play as two separated friends, Li and Shri, as they reconnect with the living home they've been away from for a season. Switch between them, discovering their abilities to explore and change the Island. Shri transforms and moves his surroundings by playing music.  Li reveals a hidden layer of the world where forgotten things lie broken, and puts them back together. As a strange call resonates throughout the land, you use their different skills to awaken the Island and its people on their path towards each other. Along the way, experience the wonders of a nature inspired by nordic landscapes and folk patterns across the world.
