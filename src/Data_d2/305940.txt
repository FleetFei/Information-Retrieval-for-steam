							About This Game
							PROJECT AURA is a simulation/strategy videogame where you take control of a colony of climate disaster survivors.

In the near future, humans will face the drastic consequences of climate change. Forced to take refuge in vital reserves using cryo-preservation, they await a second chance.

At the end of the 21st century, humans — finally aware of the great climate disaster — dedicated their efforts not on preventing the inevitable crisis, but to ensure the survival of the species itself. 
In this endeavor, they embarked on the construction of a network of cities on the sea, resistant to the hostile atmosphere. 
Overtaken by the events and extreme food shortage, they built ultra-secret shelters that would support them in hibernation, to be awakened in a more favorable situation.
