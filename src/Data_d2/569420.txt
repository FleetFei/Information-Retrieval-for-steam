If you're up for a challenge, try the old-school pigskin or relive your backyard days with the foam football.VRQB currently features two game modes with three different difficulty levels: Classic and Two Minute Drill.ClassicIn Classic mode, the player drives down the field by hitting groups of three targets spread out across the field.  Clearing each set of targets gives the player a first down, enabling the player to move down the field.

The player has the option of hitting three different targets, moving to the location of the target hit.
