							About This Game
							Just Alone - adventure game, in which you become a crewmember of a spaceship, that crashed during its flight. Bill Yesterday is the only survivor of the crash. His mission is to survive on a planet, destroyed by its previous inhabitants, equiped only with a radio and pile of debris left from his spaceship. His team was sent to gather samples and do research on the life of people who inhabited the planet. Now, Bill cannot do a lot of research, because most of his equipment broke into thousand pieces.

To survive in this hostile place, Bill has to hunt, gather resources and try not to get in the way of mutants, who turn out to be far from friendly to our protagonist.
Apart from doing numerous missions, Bill can construct a variety of bulidings, hunt and explore the surroundings.

The game is still developing. New updates&fixes come soon.
