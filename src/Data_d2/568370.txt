							About This Game
							Castle Battles streamlines the mechanics of classic, top-down strategy to create a fast paced style of gameplay like no other. Expand your empire by building castles near bountiful resources, collect gold to amass outlandish armies, and swarm your enemies in 40 unique levels.

Explore the illustrated world of “The Great Tapestry” through four story-rich campaigns: Fight to reclaim your lost homeland as Les Moustachiers. Laugh maniacally as The Clearly Evil Empire. Discover the astral mysteries of The Purperilous. And finally, set out on a hero’s journey as The Order of Awesome to stop the narrative from unravelling.

No soulless micro-transactions to help you here! Classic 4X style mechanics are condensed to their strategic core, meaning action packed matches are measured in minutes rather than hours. Thousands of troops can be in action at a time leading to all out swarm warfare.
