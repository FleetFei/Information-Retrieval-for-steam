AF2 is the massively multiplayer online fishing simulator with survival and RPG elements. Here you can not only catch fish but also choose what to do next – carve it, sell it or hand it in as a part of daily quests. You may craft new fishing tackle with its further upgrading in order to be able to catch bigger and rarer fish. But be aware! There are lots of different fish in our post-nuclear ponds – along with usual species you can easily catch some mutants!
