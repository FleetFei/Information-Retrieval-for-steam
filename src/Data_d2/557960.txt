							A lucid dream about getting ship-wrecked on a deserted island and finding that the materials from your ship have been turned into a beach bowling alley by a friendly ghost of a pirate! A fun room-scale experience/mini-game for the HTC Vive.  Can you unlock the pirate's treasure chest?  The lock on it looks fairly brittle...Minimum RequirementsHTC Vive with a reasonable room configuration for swinging your arm in a bowling motion (probably 4'x6' minimum, but larger is better).Playing InstructionsUse the Vive controller's triggers to pick up and let go of the cannon balls.  Bowl underhand or throw them overhand - it's your dream, nobody is going to stop you!
