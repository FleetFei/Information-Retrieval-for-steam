							Have you ever wondered what it would be like to float free in space? Did you think it would be easy? Do you think you can master zero gravity flight? You can find out in Astronaut Simulator.

Forget pushing endless unknown buttons and enjoy the adventure of just being and astronaut and float free in space. It is hard enough already to get where you want to go.

Experience free flight in Space in this "Manned Maneuvering Unit" simulator across twenty daring missions featuring historical space satellites, stations and probes like the Agena docking target, the Skylab and MIR space stations and the Hubble telescope among others.

Fly to the next waypoint and repair position trying to manage your Oxygen, Fuel and Electricity. Make sure you dock back when finished and don't drift away from the Space Shuttle into Space if you don't want to be lost forever.
