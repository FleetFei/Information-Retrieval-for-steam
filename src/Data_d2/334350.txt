							About This Game
							Don't Move is about ninjas, failure, ludonarrative dissonance, and player investment manipulation. Don't Move starts simply: move left or right. But as you try -- and as you fail -- to move, you unlock more of the game's mechanisms. With each new element comes new challenges and more rewards!
