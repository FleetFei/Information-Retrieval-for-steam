							Five college friends head off to the woods for a weekend of drinking, partying and fooling around. But as they sit at their campfire the first night, a blood-soaked hermit approaches them. He appears to have been infected with a flesh-eating bacterial virus, and as the hapless kids start to catch the bug, paranoia and hostility run rampant.
