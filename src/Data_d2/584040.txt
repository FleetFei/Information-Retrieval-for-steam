							About This Game
							The most challenging VR games, Benjamin's Adventures, officially released on Steam. 

Difficult challenge, music rhythm, and casual puzzle combined into one VR game. It's very different from ordinary music game, we don't emphasize music playing, players need to control a cute and little guy and sway to the rhythm of the music on a long road,  jump over obstacles, pass the level.

There are two chapters of this game: ice and fire. With three drums in front of players, you could control direction and jump by beating the drums. Don't think it's easy to play, the difficulty of Benjamin's adventures will drive you crazy. You must be quick with your hands and sharp-sighted to follow the rhythm of music, observe the terrain from far away, you should always be prepared for the challenge, are you ready?

We hope Benjamin's adventures can bring leisure and recreation gaming experience to Viriver fans. If you have any suggestions, please contact us.
