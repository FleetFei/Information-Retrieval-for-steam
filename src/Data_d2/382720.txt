							EntrepreneuREEL presents  One Couch at a Time, The first full-length feature documentary on the CouchSurfing movement and this emerging "age of sharing" humanity is entering. The film follows protagonist and veteran CouchSurfer Alexandra Liss through 21 countries, 6 subcontinents, for 7 months using CouchSurfing.org. As we explore our inner and societal limits, this film pushes us to ask ourselves and our peers, "What would YOU be willing to share with a stranger?‚Äù CouchSurfing is a planet in this "sharing economy" galaxy -- and the platform upon which this entire film takes place. Alexandra also explores crowd funding, co-working, ridesharing, and gifting at the ultimate sharing society - Burning Man! We focus, however, on the micro, by capturing the magical, heart-warming, serendipitous exchanges that occur one couch at a time. Each host and traveler along the way provides a unique experience, each becoming a sub-subject illustrating the incredible exchange. Alexandra, who begins her journey full of confusion, ends up learning lessons of a lifetime with the help of a few worldly friends. We learn that by embracing the "age of sharing" mentality we have access to methods that place your passions and dreams merely a couch away. Featured interviews include sharing economy expert Rachel Botsman, founder of Burning Man Larry Harvey, sacred economist Charles Eisenstein, and of course, the founder of Couchsurfing, Casey Fenton.
