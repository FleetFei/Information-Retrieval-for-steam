							Introducing the awaited KADOKAWA official resource series from the RPG Maker MV developer team! The first Japanese trilogy is packed with sounds and tilesets to express themes of "light" "darkness" and "twilight" in a Japanese flavor. These resources are suitable not only for Japanese RPGs but also just right to present a cyber appearance. Also, as a special perk for buying, we've resized battler data from XP to fit MV and included several pieces in each package.Materials included in Japanese Resource Pack No.1-3 "Twilight Shrine"- BGMCity 1 / City 2 / Village 1 / Village 2 / Shrine 1 / Shrine 2Temple Hall 1 / Temple Hall 2 / Congratulations / Pleasant- BGSRustling Wind 1 / Rustling Wind 2 / Rustling Wind 3 / Temple AmbiencePond 2 / Voice of the Cicadas 1 / Voice of the Cicadas 2 / Voice of the Songbird / Grandfather Clock- MEInn Jingle 1 / Inn Jingle 2 / Gag 1 /Gag 2 /Serious 2- SEHandwashing Place 1 / Handwashing Place 2 / Storehouse Key / Storehouse Door 1Storehouse Door 2 / Shamisen / Offering Box / Voice of the Crow / Pond 1 / Window 1 / Window 2-TilesetsHandwashing Hut / Torii Gate / Storehouse / Lantern / Lion-DogsSacred Tree / Pond, Shrine (Outer Walls+Roof) and other resources for use with shrines- Bonus: RPG Maker XP Battler DataFighter08 / Gunner01 / Snake02 / Goblin03 / Bird04Sample (SoundCloud)https://soundcloud.com/rpg-maker/twilight-shrine* This resource pack is one part of a trilogy of Japanese resources.
