							About This Series
							Produced by award-winning studio Lionsgate, NIGHTCAP is a clever, over-the-top culture-commentary comedy that dives into the hilarity that ensues behind-the-scenes of a fictitious late-night talk show, "The Nightcap with Jimmy." The 10-episode original scripted comedy series stars Ali Wentworth ("In Living Color," "Head Case," "It's Complicated," "Office Space") and features a mix of improvisational actors and real-life celebrities. Each half-hour episode covers the hectic minutes prior to a live airing of a late- night talk show, which are fraught with insanity, urgency, absurdity, laughter and lip-sync rehearsals. Produced by Ali Wentworth, Tom Brunelle and Brad Wollack, Zero Point Zero and Troy Miller/Dakota Films for Lionsgate, NIGHTCAP is set to premiere in 2016.
