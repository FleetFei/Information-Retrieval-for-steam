							Music fit to wake the dead! Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, it's true, but some music truly is the devil's music. An orphan raised by gypsies, now full-grown but still lost and alone, must face once more the tragic curse that destroyed her past. Will her darkling music bring ruin to the village she now calls her home? Can the heroes earn the townsfolk's trust, or must innocence be sacrificed for the heroes to save town from the mysterious hauntings that plague a village huddled in the shadow of an accursed ruin? This dark fantasy adventure is perfect for 1st-level characters using the 5th edition of the world's most famous role-playing game. The adventure can be played on its own or in combination with The Murmuring Fountain, or as part of the beginning of a horror-themed Adventure Path campaign.Requires: 5E rulesetConversion by: Zacchaeus
