Loving or hating math surprisingly enough you’ll really enjoy this game! Get to know a Number’s life each step of the way and help numbers achieve their goals in life. But be careful, just like you they can get sick and sleepy. Numbers will teach you that even the mightiest task can be divided into smaller problems.
