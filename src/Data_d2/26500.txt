							About This Game
							Cogs is a puzzle game where players build machines from sliding tiles.  Players can choose from 50 levels and 3 gameplay modes.  New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently.
                    
                    Inventor Mode: Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines â€” gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more.
                    Time Challenge Mode: If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here.  This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it.
                    Move Challenge Mode: Take your time and plan ahead.  Every click counts when you only get ten moves to find a solution.
