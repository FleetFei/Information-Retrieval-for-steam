							AN ADAPTATION OF A CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BOARD GAME
Background
Alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable – only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and rule the galaxy?

Gameplay
Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. But instead of overcomplex set of rules and overall epicness, it offers more accessible choices, more elegant mechanics and much faster gameplay. And it does all of that without reducing the strategic depth of the game - just like every euro-style board game should.

Eclipse other civilizations and lead your people to victory!
