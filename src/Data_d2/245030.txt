							Reinforcements for the Commonwealth!Explore new tactics with 3 brand new ships from the Commonwealth shipyards.Bluebell: The Bluebell is a great defensive option. Compared to the other ships in its class it is a little slow and lightly armored. However, the Bluebell has the ability to equip a 3x3 weapon, which no other class 2 ship can do. Heavy Scout: An evolution of the Scout, this ship can hold its own in pitched battle situations against larger ships. It is also an excellent vanguard unit, with armament possibilities that can stall the opposing force. Katakus: This catamaran-style ship combines average speed with versatile weapon options. Watch out for the forward-facing Hybrid battery -- it is this ship's main weakness!
