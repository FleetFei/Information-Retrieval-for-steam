When you launch Clans, you will see a window pop up:

"Please insert the CLANS CD! Hit OK when done, or Cancel if you don't want any music."

This is an olde school Diablo type game, back in the days when games were run with the CD inserted. The interesting feature of this particular game is that the
contents of the original CD contained only the music for the game. What this means is that you can put ANY music CD into your CD player and the game will play it! If you don’t want to have music playing, simply hit ‘Cancel’ and the game will launch. Have fun!

The original CD audio has been added to the game files. If you want to hear the original soundtrack, you will have to navigate to your Steam directory where the game files for Clans reside. You will find a folder called "Clans music", and the audio files are in there. Then you will have to burn an audio CD and put into your CD drive.
