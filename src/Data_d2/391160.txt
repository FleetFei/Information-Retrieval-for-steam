							The Deletion is a challenging minimalist puzzle-platform game with 40 levels of awesomeness.  The controls are simple but the levels will test your wits as you use careful timing and reflexes to avoid deletion. Physics can change as you experience new levels and you'll find that gravity isn't static. You'll experience frequent frustration but also accomplishment as you use your mind and dexterity to complete puzzles and get through each challenge.
