This outbreak quickly spread across the world bringing human life down to near extinction. The people who survived named the new era the Aftershock. The game is set on you being a soldier fighting for one of two factions: The Faithless and The GuardiansAt the beginning of the game, you are sent out on a mission to rebuild the Shetlands and clear out the infected but resources are tight and you will mostly have to fend for yourself. The player will spawn in a C130 and be presented with a 20 square kilometre map to explore with friends and survive the deadly infected and dangerous enemy faction. This is YOUR story!"Someone once asked me if I remembered how it all went down, as if it happened so long ago that anyone could forget, so yeah I remember, I remember when our streets and homes turned into war zones, I remember when the world went dark, I remember when they tried to contain it as if it was ever going to stop anything, I remember when we worked together instead of killing, so yeah I remember how it all went down, but none of that matters anymore, I'm a killer, a survivor, and nothing will ever stop me from out living the AfterShock."
