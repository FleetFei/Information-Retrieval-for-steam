							The Leprechaun is back in the hood, all blazed up and seeking revenge! When a group of friends discover his treasure, they soon find out they've unleashed a can of demented whoop ass! With their stack of riches, they go from poor to ghetto-fabulous overnight, spending their newfound loot on pimped-out cars and hair extensions. One by one the friends stand up to the weed-smoking, knife-wielding, car-stealing leprechaun who will stop at nothing to get his treasure back. Evil has a whole new rap and the kids from the hood had better watch their backs!
