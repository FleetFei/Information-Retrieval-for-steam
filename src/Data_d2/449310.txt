							About This Game
							In a secret lab, an evil scientist worked for years to create the ultimate formula that would give him incredible powers. It didn't work out, so the project was abandoned and the formula was left to sit alone in an empty warehouse for years, slowly mutating until it came to life and became Spunk and Moxie!

Help Spunk and Moxie escape in this classic-style platformer with a fresh new twist; one-button input gives the player full control over sliding, jumping, and bouncing through 30 unique levels across 3 industrial themes: The Warehouse, Factory, and Laboratory.
