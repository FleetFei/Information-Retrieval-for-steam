							Bacon.Doors is an atmospheric first person logic game where you traverse a strange world in search of bacon.  Designed for hardcore logic puzzle fans, everything is based on one simple concept.  Use logic to determine where you will go - some doors lead to bacon, while others lead to death.  You will be tested - but you will stop at nothing to achieve the ultimate reward in life: Bacon, and maybe begin to understand where you are.This is a short indie game developed by a one-man-team.  Inspired by Limbo, The Stanley Parable, and the Portal Series, Doors attempts to bring something new to the puzzle genre.Website: http://doorsgame.com/
