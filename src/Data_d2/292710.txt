							Highlighting a few miniature versions of big fan favorites, The Big Little Character Pack is sure to deliver a fun take on some famous Middle-earth residents! Strike a little fear and terror into the hearts of your foes with Baby Smaug, or enjoy a cameo appearance of Baby Gimli from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The LEGO Big Figure Snow Troll is sure to shake things up and you’ll also have the chance to play as Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took or a Stone Dwarf from Erebor. If you find yourself weary of travel by foot, take a ride on the Spider.  Remember: it’s not about the journey itself, but rather the experience we have with those we take along with us!
