							About This Game
							Welcome to a racing game where track memorization is a thing of the past!In Velocity Stream one player takes control over the Paver, a spacecraft that flies through the game world, leaving a trail of energy in its wake.It's on this trail that the other players race each other. The Pavers goal is to create a road so difficult that the other players fall too far behind and get eliminated, while the Racers aim is to be the first to catch up with the Paver. To create more exciting and difficult tracks, the Paver can pick up powerups in the surroundings, including narrow roads and obstacles.This mechanic results in a racing game where victory is solely decided by skill, rather than track memorization. The racer who wins will be the one who can find the best racing lines, master the handling of his or her racer and be able to make the car drift when necessary.Infinite race tracksZero track memorizationOnline multiplayerExciting powerupsSplitscreen modeHuman or AI controlled paver
