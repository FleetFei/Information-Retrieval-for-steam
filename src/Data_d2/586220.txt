							The magical room is about to get even better! Now you can:- watch five great new stories: Gulliver in the Country of the Lilliputians, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Captain Fracassie, Many Miles Under the Sea and Treasure Island;- shoot soap bubbles from a cool bubble gun;- play with new toys; - draw with colored pencils; - turn off gravity and see what happens when ordinary objects become weightless – you can’t do that in a real-life playroom!
