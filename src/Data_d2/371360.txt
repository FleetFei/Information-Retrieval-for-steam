							About This Game
							Once upon a time all was peaceful and serene in the far off land of Camalon, but the silence has been broken as the Orc hordes have returned to the peaceful kingdom to claim the land that they once held most sacred. The only thing stopping them from conquering the innocent people of Camalon is your arsenal of weapons and advanced research towers.

Progress through various waves and stages of Orc and Goblin invasions on both paths and open room scale battlefields, all along developing an increasingly sophisticated tower system to take down even the most powerful of Orcs enemies. 

For a truly unique experience, you can now enter the world of Orc Assault exclusively with the HTC Vive VR headset and oversee the entire playfield. Once you play tower defense in virtual reality at room scale, you will fully understand the complete immersion that VR provides a wide range of gaming experiences. The fully animated characters and detailed animation-inspired world immerses you as you plan your final tactics and use fully tracked controller wands to plot your strategy and defend both the town on Camalon and riches beyond.
