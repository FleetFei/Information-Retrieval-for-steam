 It is presented in this pack in its BR Blue livery.

The British Rail Class 07 was introduced in 1962, to replace steam tank locomotives which were still serving the docks at Southampton. 14 were built by Rustin & Hornsby and they served the docks into the late 1970s, their 275-horsepower engine allowing a maximum speed of 27.5mph. By the time the class was retired, they had been repainted from their original green livery to BR Corporate Blue, which this add-on recreates. As with many classes of shunter, many found subsequent employment with private owners after withdrawal by British Rail, and no less than seven examples have survived into preservation. The Class 07s on heritage railways still fulfil their primary functions of yard work and assembling trains.
