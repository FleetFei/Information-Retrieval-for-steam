							Inspired by reading more than one thousand Russian fairy tales, this is a story about love, spite, greed, modesty, humility and seeking. It is divided into four acts - according to the four seasons. That means you'll visit some of the game locations several times, but every time at a different season and in a different time of day.

Together with the characters of a humble girl Nastienka and gallant hero Ivan you are to overcome many baits and puzzles and in the end you'll try some of the wedding's pirozhki.

You are awaited by mysterious beings and magic objects, wild beasts and domestic animals and pets, guileful highway robbers, evil hag Baba Yaga, Old Man Mushrooom, prudent Father Frosty and many other traditional and non-traditional fairy-tale characters.

Any child able to switch a computer on can play this with parental assistance, however, this is ideal for children aged 6 years as their first game as the PC control system is for the beginner.
