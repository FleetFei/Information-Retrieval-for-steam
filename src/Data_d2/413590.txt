							The unlock key to upgrade to the full-version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms Maker".

So many options for editing become available for the full-version owners! 

Create your own unique scenario and upload it to make other players try!
A wide range of editing options are available, including officers' names, faces and parameters, countries, forces, rewards, battlefields and titles. Freely editing them all will even allow you to create a totally new world, far removed from the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"! There are also a replete selection of support functions, such as auto creation of officer parameters or back story based on selected images.
As well as thousands of available images for officer faces, including those taken from the history of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" series, a function is also provided to easily add your own images to the game.
