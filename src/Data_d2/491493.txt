							The North American T-6 Texan™ was an excellent design that served as a basic transitional combat trainer in all branches of U.S. service as well as in countries worldwide. U.S. Navy pilots utilised the type under the SNJ designation, the most common versions being the SNJ-4, SNJ-5 and SNJ-6. The RAF was very taken with the design and adopted it as the Harvard. Later versions were manufactured in Canada and the type saw service in countries worldwide. An excellent all-round trainer, the type was quite good at teaching new pilots to avoid the accelerated stall, as a wing would snap round quite rapidly if the pilot was unwary. Approximately 17,000 of the type were built and some 350 are still airworthy.Features:Self shadowing, bump mapping and reflection bloomAuthentic T-6™ soundset includedAuthentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controlsRear cockpit included in v-cPhotorealistic all-xml 2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot and radiosTwo unique panel images includedSubtle smoke trail and wingtip vortices effectsStartup flame and smoke effectTogglable pilot figuresSeparate animated front and rear canopiesHighly authentic flight model with illustrated checklist
