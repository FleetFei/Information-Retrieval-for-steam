							WolfWars is a fantasy tactical strategy card game.It may sound a bit weird, but we took & simplified rules from many other card games and created a new concept so anyone on the planet can enjoy it. WolfWars is not a game about trading or collecting cards, but you will be able to build or edit your decks with available cards and heroes. Each player has the same amount of cards from the beginning to the end. There is no f2p/pay2win model, you all have same chances at the start. Before you start the game, you will need to create your deck. Deck needs to have 1 hero and 5 playing cards. You can have as many decks as you wish to have. These 5 cards are all what you have during one game. You do not sacrifice any of them.Key Features:Singleplayer (PVE)Cross platform multiplayer (2-4players)Simultaneous turnsRealtime turnsCo-op (1vs2, 1vs3 2vs2) (players vs players & players vs AI-bot)
