							About This Game
							You can't beat this game!!! Super Hipster Lumberjack is a love letter to very difficult flash platformers. It is a collaboration of ideas I have had since I was a kid and the games I have always enjoyed playing. In this story Noah attempts to make a game for the first time. He then gets trapped in his own creation. He learns that making games is a lot harder than he thought.
