							With strong area-of-effect attacks, the dwarves pack a powerful punch.

The dwarves hail from distant fortresses of stone, seeking wealth and glory through victory at the Hero Academy.

Dwarves are extremely crafty and gain improved bonuses from the playfield's premium squares. They are masters of area attacks.

This add-on includes the Dwarves team, 17 Dwarf avatars, and a unique Dwarf hat for Team Fortress 2 players.
