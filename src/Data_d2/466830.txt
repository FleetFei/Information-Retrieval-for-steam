							About This Game
							An artistic narrative designed to evoke a surreal feeling in the player on a psychological level. The work is not structured like a typical game, one could even describe it as an anti-game in that there are no "Game Overs." Don't let that fool you though, it's a platformer-puzzle-advanture with a handful of different endings!
