							Is there intelligent life in the universe? Are we alone in the stars? Of course not, it's filled with Zombies! That's right, the DEAD have filled the skies and no LIVING creature can hope to fight them. Lucky for us, ghosts are already dead! Sensing the opportunity for plunder, the Ghost Pirates have taken to the stars on their ethereal ships, hoping to loot the graves of the space dead. Now it is up to YOU to take command of the Space Ghost Pirate Zombie Slayer fleet and lead them against the Zombie menace! With Admiral Death at the helm, what is dead may always die!
