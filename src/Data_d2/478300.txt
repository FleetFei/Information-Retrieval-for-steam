							ESSENTIAL READING FOR ALL ROAD USERS
A thorough understanding of The Highway Code is essential for all road users and will help ensure that you use the roads safely and legally. 

REVISE ANYTIME, ANYWHERE!
All road users, not just learners, need to know the rules and regulations within the Highway Code. Plus it's essential that you can recognise and respond to EVERY road sign in the UK. Failure to do so could lead to fines, penalty points or even the loss of your licence.
