							Dive in to help Freddi Fish and Luther keep the ocean from draining and save the sea creatures! Luther’s got to pop an ocean full of air bubbles before they make it to the surface. A souped-up slingshot, a little fancy finwork and some help from you are all he’ll need! Sea sponges, boulders and teleporting whirlpools are some of the useful tools you’ll need to succeed.
