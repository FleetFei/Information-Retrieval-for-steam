							Murchison 2 is a merging of the original Narrow Gauge Murchison logging layout with an extensive Standard Gauge rail network.						By incorporating landscape based on actual New Zealand electronic map data with specially developed Nature Series sets (animated waterfalls, river splines, textures, cliff splines, rail ledge splines, rock splines), Murchison 2 takes Trainz to a new level of realism. The result is a photo-realistic colonial layout, set in the steam/diesel transition era, that users can submerge themselves in for a complete interactive rail experience.						Whether a steam-era NG enthusiast, or solely interested in SG steam or diesel operation, the 440 board Murchison 2 layout contains a huge variety of interactive and inter-related industries for operational pleasure that will keep the train enthusiast immersed for 100's of hours of interactive operation.Key features:						The Murchison 2 pack includes the full NATURE SERIES pack of TRAINZ add-ons. These are used extensively in the Murchison layout and are also available for use in your own layout building (to add that extra level of photo realism).Waterfalls - 40 different animated waterfalls with built-in sound						River splines - 188 river splines from pre-built full rivers splines to river sides for assembling you own unique rivers						Textures - 200 textures from the Lord of the Rings country						Cliff splines - 390 3D textured cliff splines from arid country to mountain cliffs including rail cuttings						Rail Ledge Splines - 408 3D textured rail ledges for creating those unique river gorge and hill country rail effects						Rock splines - 80 3D rock splines.Layout Specs:2 years and 3500 hrs in the building						440 boards of spectacular 3D terrain incorporating the NATURE SERIES 1 & 2 sets						Extensive SG and NG inter-related and interactive industries						Set in rural pioneer country						Country towns and rail yards						Steep hills and spectacular high-county, ravines, gully's and Fiords						Fully signaled with Coloured Light Main line signals and Semaphore Branch line signals						Breath-taking realism						Continually changing landscape and terrain						Comes with 28 sessions for quick familiarization						Operational rail ferries - load and move rail ferries between ports						Operational River Steamer - navigate the interactive river lock						Operational aerial flight - explore aboard the helicopter						100's of hrs of operational pleasureTrackwork:190 km (120 miles) of scenic SG mainline and branch lines						55 km (34 miles) of NG logging and mining lines						175 km (110 miles) of aerial helicopter route						100 km (63 miles) of Ocean / River ship routes
