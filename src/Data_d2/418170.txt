							About This Game
							MicroRC Simulation is a driving simulator for radio-controlled toy cars.
You must practise to learn the different tracks and conquer the
podium.This is not an arcade game, as practise is required to win the
races.
The A.I. doesn't follow a predefined path, but reads the track in real time.

win against highly skilled competitives.
