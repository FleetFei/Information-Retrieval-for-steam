At this point, all islands have the same resources and only differs by amounts and its size, but as new things will be added you will be forced to explore more of the world.Find The Right CombinationsBig part of the game is crafting. To craft something you have to know or guess its combination of items in your inventory. Some items can be made by multiple ways. For alpha purposes most of items can be crafted easily, either from one or two items.Claim Your IslandTo ensure your safety from predators and enemies you can build your own shelter. The game has building menu where you can see all available blueprints. To build an object you have to create its construction site and then add necessary items to it.The gameplay can be quite confusing at first, so I recommend to read this Basic Tutorial.If you have any suggestions, found a bug or just have constructive feedback for me, please visit game’s Steam Forum and let me know.
