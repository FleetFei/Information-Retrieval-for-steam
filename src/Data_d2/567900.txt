							I know it isn't Christmas yet, but we just couldn't wait!
Santa came early, and left Free DLC under the tree for you!

This Christmas DLC is a single-song pack.
It doesn't have an arena challenge, and there isn't any gear to unlock...
But, it does have... some experiments. Some... oddities.

It's... let's say, New.

Playable in Freeplay Mode and Story Modes, here comes "Deck The Dubstep", by Andross!

Getcho festive hat on!!!
