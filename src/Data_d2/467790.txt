If you're interested in programming games from the ground up in C or C++, distributing for multiple platforms, or programming OpenGL computer graphics, or just curious about how the "guts" of these things look, then you will enjoy following along and chatting with us. We will most likely try a combination of written, video, stream, and forum content. We've kept the game really easy to mod, so if you want to replace the art, make new enemies or maps you can do so. You will of course have access to the source code, warts and all, so you can see how it was done and modify it.
