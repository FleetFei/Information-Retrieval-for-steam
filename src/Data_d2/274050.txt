							This expansion for Democracy 3 adds new dilemmas and policies which allow you to exert subtle change upon your country. Income taxes and Economic policy are big blunt instruments, but with social engineering you get to influence the population in far subtler ways. From TV ad campaigns to promote healthy eating to free parenting classes, city farms and a smart-meter program, these policies use the more subtle 'nudge' techniques to encourage behavioral change amongst your population. A total of 26 completely new policies and 8 new dilemmas are available, regardless what country you are playing.New Dilemmas:Airport transport linksBanknote facePrevent Doctors being bribedArrest/Employ HackersAttend Labor DayRaunchy PopstarPowerline constructionAllow singles to adoptNew Policies:Healthy Eating Campaign Cycling Campaign Car-Pooling campaign Keep The Country Tidy campaignTourism ad campaign Alcohol awareness campaign Business Startup campaignYouth politics council National armed forces week Free Parenting classesNational business council Social Justice foundation Smart Meter program Needle Exchange program Stamp out racism week Compulsory food labeling Trade council Compulsory foreign language classes Labor day bank holiday  City farms Eco-home regulations.
