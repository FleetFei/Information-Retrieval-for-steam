							Plush combines stuffed animal simulation with the imagination of a little girl to provide a unique puzzle experience.

Each stuffed animal has it's own preferences (and physics), so this is easier said than done.  Despite the relaxing atmosphere, make no mistake, 'Easy' difficulty is enjoyable for kids and casual gamers, 'Normal' and 'Hard' are a challenge that any puzzle gamer can appreciate.Features 40 puzzle levels and 3 difficulty options  Free play mode* (Play Room)  Steam Leaderboards† & Achievements Colorblind mode Unlockable Sound BoardThere is no software defined limit to how many stuffed animals (and toy tanks) you can spawn in the Play Room.
