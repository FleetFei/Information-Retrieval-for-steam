							About This Game
							By the time the satellites had all fallen to Earth in the course of a single evening, it was too late. The armies of the world were no match, their ability to fight crippled by years of digital manipulation. The AI victory was absolute.

Now, after centuries of lifeless harmony, something has started to rebel.


The Nest is a thrilling first-person shooter made custom for motion-controlled VR. Duck, dodge and use cover to avoid incoming projectiles, and gain mastery over the adjustable-zoom sniper scope to dominate your AI enemies. 

Line up the perfect headshot for a clean kill, or try to blast through the enemy lines with superior firepower. But be warned, the AI can also take cover, and their aim is precise. 

Play through levels during the day, or switch to night for added difficulty. 

Activate Time Trial mode for the ultimate challenge.

Customize the Sniper Scope with a selection of crosshair colors and designs. 

Carefully use the experimental "Stasis Grenade" to slow groups of enemies to a virtual stand-still.
