							A 5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for 4-6 PCs of Levels 10-11Followers of earth deities literally worship the ground they walk on and have always built below-ground shrines. A school of four gnome mages called the Earth Barons was no exception, constructing one such holy place where a desert met a range of rocky hills. Recently however, the mages were wiped out when a visiting dignitary turned out to be a suicide assassin that broke a fully-charged staff of power in their midst. The PCs find the unsealed capstone to the shrine as they are on another journey. The recent event isnâ€™t yet common knowledge, and the temple is unused; therefore, despite the guardians, a brave party might be able to discover two valuable items.5E Mini-Dungeons are small adventures for 5th Edition which are setting agnostic and are easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.Requires: A Fantasy Grounds full or ultimate license or an active subscription and the included 5E Ruleset.
