							----------PLEASE NOTE: Scraps is the side project of a single developer at this time. Consequently development is slow, so my suggestion is to buy Scraps now only if you want to play it as it is now.----------Scraps: Modular Vehicle Combat is a vehicle combat game where you build your vehicle from parts, and where success lies just as much in designing a well-crafted vehicle as in your combat skills. Design from the chassis up, then pit your creation against humans or AI in a combat arena. When you take out other players, scavenge from their wreckage to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.Scraps lets you create a vehicle that’s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons – that’s okay. Maybe it doesn't need an engine because it moves by firing its cannons backwards. You decide what you drive.Your design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle. Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet. Easily host your own LAN or Internet games. Using the Scraps demo version, your friends can join a LAN game even if they don't own the full game.language Note:The only complete language at this time is English, but partial in-game volunteer translations are selectable for Russian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, French, Swedish, and Polish.
