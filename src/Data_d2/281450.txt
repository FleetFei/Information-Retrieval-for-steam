							About This Game
							It is now the dawn of a new age. The most momentous of wars has begun in the heart of 
the Sacred Lands. Four races - the Empire, the Mountain Clans, the Undead Hordes and the 
Legions of the Damned - stand ready for battle as they fight for the survival and dominance 
of their war-torn world, and the gods they have long believed in.

The Mighty Lords watch silently as their Disciples prepare for the daunting tasks ahead. 
Each warrior must engage in a struggle of swordplay, sorcery, and uncommon courage in order 
to complete their sacred quests.

The Empire fight to secure their people's future; The Mountain Clans search to regain their 
rune knowledge; The Undead Hordes seek revenge for their accursed god; and The Legions of the 
Damned battle to resurrect their fallen angel's soul. It is a struggle of desperation.

Every stroke of a sword, each blast of fiery magic must be endured beyond exhaustion. For once 
the clouds of destruction clear, lands will have been transformed, new armies will have been 
forged and the cheers of the liberated will resound throughout the land.

The day of reckoning has come...

Only one race shall claim victory. Only the chosen will survive.
