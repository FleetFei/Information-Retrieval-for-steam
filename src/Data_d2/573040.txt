							Love. 
The "Untalented" one's "Talent", that surpasses all things. 

Welcome to Mikage Academy, a famed educational institute that prides itself on being the home school of prime ministers, world-renowned artists, great businessmen, and all sorts of other movers and shakers of society. What's their secret? They accept only students with Talents – special powers that border on magic, granted by the divine, said to only occur in one in every ten thousand people by the time they reach adolescence.
 
I'm in love with this girl, Yuki Suzu, the dorm leader of the elites on campus, the White Lilies. And you know where I am on the pecking order? The very bottom of the Black Roses, a pack of slackers and rejects. And you guessed it – our dorms get along like cats and dogs.
