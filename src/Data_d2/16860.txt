							The period of Classical Antiquity saw the rise of city states from Phoenicia, Greece, and later Rome and Persia.
						Their struggles all centered on the great sea in the "Middle of the Earth," hence the name Mediterranean. This map covers the entire Mediterranean basin including the nearby peninsulas and coasts where these great empires grew and prospered.
						The Cradle of Civilization map packs are Firaxis-designed maps of real-world locations. You can play random leaders in these settings, or choose leaders appropriate to the history of these areas. The maps can also be opened up in World Builder, where you can even create specific scenarios.
