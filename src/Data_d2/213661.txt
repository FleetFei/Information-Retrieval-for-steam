							This is the Skirmish Pack for Dwarfs!? It adds in the following 3 extra modes for you to play:Sandbox - here is your chance to create your own caves and populate them with whatever bad guys you feel like!Rush Mode - digger dwarfs will continuously spawn, without pause. And you can only let 200 of them die - just how long can you last in this mode> And how big will your score get!?Dark Mode - if the standard Arcade mode is not enough of a challenge for you (or you just want life for your Dwarfs to be a little bit more scary) then play this mode. In this mode, the unexplored sections of the map are ALL dark - nothing is marked for you. Send your dwarfs forth to explore and collect gold and loot. Or die. Or both, of course!And remember - the core game is always FREE! You buy the add-on packs once and can play them with no restrictions, for ever after!
