Create your content using our drag and drop visual interface and intuitive event editor, then with a touch of a button our tools will build a Visual Studio project for you, ready to be deployed to Visual Studio and compiled to test on Windows 10 PCs, Windows 10 Mobile phones and tablets like the Surface Pro.  You can even build and test your app on the Xbox One.Once you are happy with your app, our tools will build everything you need to submit your finished creation to Microsoft, Itâ€™s that easy! Required: to test a app with the exporter you must have installed one of the latest versions of Microsoft's Visual Studio. In order to test on Xbox One you must sign up for the Xbox ID program and set your Xbox One to Developer console mode.Please be aware that this exporter add-on will only work with a full version of Fusion 2.5 - you will not be able to install it against a demo, limited or free version of any of these software titles.
