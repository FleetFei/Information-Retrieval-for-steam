							About This Game
							Behind our comfortable, familiar dimensions, beyond the timeless depths of space, there is a Place that mankind was not meant to know. A Place hostile to all life. We do not belong there. We cannot survive there. At least, not for long…Euclidean; a game of geometric horror; a slow descent into the dark, into madness, futility, and despair, where Things greater than you watch and wait and dream. Struggle for every second of life you have left… Even knowing you’re better off dead.An endless faller through tense otherworldly environmentsThree difficulty levels: HARD, NIGHTMARISH and IMPOSSIBLE9 distinct stages of hand-crafted terrorTerrifying VR support Binaural 3d audio by 3Deception®Haunting ambient soundtrackNo zombies
