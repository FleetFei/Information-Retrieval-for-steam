							The newest release from the Historical Simulation Game landmark series, "Nobunaga's Ambition!"
In this release we include "Officer Play" for the first time in the series, allowing players to advance from retainer to Castle Lord and then on to Daimyo. Experience the reality of an officer of the warring states from differing perspectives!

■Experience the Warring States as an Officer, "Officer Play"
We have added "Officer Play," where players experience the life of a Warring States officer as he advances from retainer to Castle Lord and then on to Daimyo. 
Enjoy a variety of play styles. Conquer the land, advance in status and position, or turn the tables on your superiors. The choice is yours. 

■Carefully develop your territory with "Garden politics"
Some places have water sources. Some have highways. Some have other characteristics. Juggle these characteristics as you develop your territory as you see fit.
Choose the facilities to build and enjoy watching your territory bloom due to your management.  

■Witness strategic battle from the officer's viewpoint! "Evolved Battle"
Experience the battle from the viewpoint of a single officer. Experience the strategy of deep, thrilling battlefields, using different "formations" and "tactics."
We've added a new "Camp Log" system, allowing various missions to occur during battle. The battle will change in real-time depending on the results of these missions, allowing for even more dramatic battles.

■Intense battles, realistically displayed! "Siege Battles" "Naval Battles"
We will portray full-scale siege and naval battles with newly revised visuals. Experience the intensity of real battle with siege battles using cannons, naval battles using armored boats, and more. In addition, we will bring even more spark to the battles with a plentiful variation of castles to host these sieges.
