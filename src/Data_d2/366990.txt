							About This Game
							Puzzle Station offers two game modes: Arcade and Puzzle. Both modes have 50 levels.
In the Puzzle Mode you are given a limited amount of drops and your goal is to clear the playfield before you run out of moves.
If you are looking for a more casual game mode and just want to "zone out" the game offers an Arcade Mode where you can just blast away and hunt for the high score.
