							Expanding author N.R. Burnette's story of the KENJI universe, MANEKI'S CURSE is an old-school dungeon crawler about the slain god of war, Maneki, trying to escape the Labyrinth of the Underworld.

In the realm of mortals, it is Gojun who reigns after killing the former god of war, Maneki. Now Maneki's soul is trapped in the Underworld--a rich labyrinth from which no soul can escape. But the former god of war's soul is unlike any other, and his vengeance has had a millennium to burn.

The game was designed by author N.R. Burnette, who's novels include the PAPHOS Books 1-5, CARGO LOCK 5, and KENJI. Music is composed and arranged by Forrest Clark, with original melodies from N.R. Burnette. This game is a dungeon crawler unlike any other utilizing timeless JRPG mechanics courtesy of RPG Maker VX-Ace.
