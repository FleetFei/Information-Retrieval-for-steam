							About This Game
							Vehicle Simulator in an open world flying/sailing simulator, having accurate flight physics and marine dynamics.
This simulator allows you to fly, drive and sail where ever you wish, to explore and customize your planes and boats and to train yourself on all forms of flight and sailing.

Vehicle Simulator was created by Ilan Papini, its first version released in March 2009.
It is based upon Micro Flight and Virtual Sailor, previous simulators made by Ilan, and combines them into one newer, more advanced and flexible program.
The game has a much denser scenery than the previous games, more advanced physical simulation, and a totally flexible vehicle design.

Vehicle Simulator includes a built in scenery and vehicle designer, making it much simpler for users to create and share content than ever before.
The simple yet powerful vehicle design makes Vehicle Simulator an excellent learning tool and also a powerful preliminary design tool.
