							You've just gotten a new job!

Yes, you're the new apprentice for Death. The Grim Reaper. 

It's your job to help gather souls. Only thing is, you can't just go and kill people to get their souls, it has to look natural, like an accident! And you can make this job in a very fun way, using amazing powers to do things like flood places, turn machines on and off, create dangerous chemical reactions and much more. That means for example setting up bottles, knives, brooms, and other regular objects in such a way as to create deadly (as well as amusing) chain reactions.

The Deathâ€™s Life features a series of challenging puzzle in different daily situations. To advance in the game you must find and interact with the objects in the scene to solve the puzzle, triggering a sequence of events and causing the "accidental" death of your victims.

Try a day in Death's Life. Dying has never been more fun!
