The DLC Yamaha Historical Bikes is a memento of the recent past, featuring bikes that enchanted millions of motorcyclists. The R7 (1998) was specifically designed to compete in the championship dedicated to 750 cc bikes and only 500 units were produced. The R1 (1998) was conceived with the objective of creating a unique bike that would combine the performance of a 1,000 cc with the lightness and maneuverability of a 600 - legend has it that Yamaha redesigned every single component. The R1 (2002), developed under the supervision of Kunihiko Miwa, was the first major revision of the model, bringing better handling and a higher level of riding pleasure.Yamaha YZF R7 1998:•	Displacement: 749cc•	Maximum power: 77.3 kW (106CV) @ 11.000 rpm•	Maximum torque: 72 Nm (7.4 kg-m) @ 9000 rpm•	Wet weight (including full oil and fuel tank): 207KgYamaha YZF R1 1998:•	Displacement: 998cc•	Maximum power: 109.5 kW (148.8CV) @ 10.000 rpm•	Maximum torque: 108.3 Nm (11.0 kg-m) @ 8500 rpm•	Wet weight (including full oil and fuel tank): 193 KgYamaha YZF R1 2002:•	Displacement: 998cc•	Maximum power: 110.8 kW (152CV) @ 10.500 rpm•	Maximum torque: 104.9 Nm (70.71 kg-m) @ 8500 rpm•	Wet weight (including full oil and fuel tank): 193 Kg
