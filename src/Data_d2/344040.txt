I will add most of the requested features in game.What there MIGHT be Local Co-Op Multiplayer with Dedicated ServersPlease note that Voxelized is in very early stages of the development.Even though you can get it now for cheaper at early access, please remember that it is unfinished, but it is fully playable.  As mentioned on the Short Description:This game is on Early Access, and it means this game is not yet finished.It is under development as you play and i will keep on updating as much as possible.There will be many bugs, mayby even crashes. I´ll always fix them as soon as possible.I cannot promise that you will get to keep your saves, but i´ll work hard to make sure your saves will be savedI want to point that out because there have been too much confusion within the Early Access games.
