							About This Game
							Hunter's Grimm, which is inspired by the Dragon Quest Series and Chrono Trigger, is a spooky adventure about hunting down ghosts, monsters, and demons. Embark on a 10 hour adventure as demon-hunters Nicholas and Sarai Grimm(brother and sister) fighting the evils of the world, for a price. For Sarai and Nicholas, life is simple: search for monsters, kill the monsters, accept the award, and get frosty chocolate milkshakes and boring old research books for all. But one night, one favor to a friend has set them on a path neither would have expected. An attempt at a selfless act has them branded outlaws, hunted by an old rival, and left them trying to understand what is happening. What awaits them is the beginning of an adventure neither of them are prepared for. Discover new lands, help those in need, and become the ultimate monster hunter.695 AchievementsEmoticonsAchievement icons provided for free by EmojiOne.com
