							About This Game
							Netw0rm is an 80's sci-fi inspired action game in which the player takes on a number of large corporations as an anonymous hacker, selling or leaking stolen data files, syphoning credits from secret accounts and earning credibility amongst their peers.

They get to see the consequences of their actions as the news media reacts to the data they leak, then use their ill-gotten gains to purchase upgrades to their hardware, and install new ICE-breakers and tools to enable runs on bigger and more lucrative servers in the future.
