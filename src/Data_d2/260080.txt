							About This Game
							Don’t overlook this lost gem! It’s a tasty morsel of trivia that we found under the couch back in the early 2000s, and now we’re pulling it right back out from under that same, dust-mite filled couch!

YOU DON’T KNOW JACK, the trivia game that became a TV show that became a massage therapist (briefly) is hoisting her billowy sails once again! This multi-award-winningest juggernaut wants to party at your house with freshly mined nuggets of GOLD!
