							About This Game
							Line/Dash is an Arcade-oriented game that doubles as a procedural player-controlled multimedia sculpture.	The basic gameplay is extremely simple, and only requires two buttons: The left click of your mouse will drop lines from the sky, while the right click will make those lines dash forward.	As the pace of the opposition gets faster and the line start splitting and crossing Line/Dash becomes a hypnotic and ever-changing visual experience. And you can also get high scores and stuff if you really lean that way!	WARNING Lots of contrasting bright colors, if you have problems with that stuff maybe don't play it	Controller SupportThe game is fully playable with a controller after setting it up in the initial launcher. It will still need keybord/mouse support to get through the launcher
