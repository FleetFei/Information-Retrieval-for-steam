							This is the official Soundtrack of In Between. 

We tried to capture the mood of the different stages of grief by creating a dense and abstract atmosphere. Since the visual style of In Between has the look of a dense painting we decided to have a bold composition for the music, which is basically non-lyrical ambient music. In combination both artistic layers are in a synergetic relationship. While the music fits the character of each stage it also supports the pacing of the gameplay and remains calm and comforting. At some points in the game the soundscape tries to be dynamic by modulating sound and music in real-time while reacting to the player's interactions.
