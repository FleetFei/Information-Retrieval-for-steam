							About This Game
							**NOTE: Skyreach is best played with a console controller, ideally Xbox 360 / One or PS4. It can be played with Keyboard & Mouse.**

Skyreach is a free game inspired by playing with car toys and building tracks for them to drive on. It's an exploration of building track and driving at the same time, instead of the more traditional build track first, then drive on it after. Players are able to build one path piece a head of their current location. This requires players to not only successfully stay on the path, but also plan where to build in order to reach the end of the level. 

The environment for Skyreach was inspired by the Arches National Park of Utah mixed with the floating rocks on Pandora of James Cameron's Avatar. We also drew inspiration from the rock carvings of Petra, Jordan and Palmyra, Syria.
