							VIRTUAnimator is a simple, easy-to-use animation tool, made for VR.Load a scene, spawn some objects, then pose them - create keyframes, and watch it animate between each pose automatically. You can even render out your animation as an image sequence (and an MP4 file soon)!If you're not too great at animation, you can still pose objects, characters, add particles and lights, and more, and render out cool stills or backgrounds!With Steam Workshop support, you can even add your own content, whether that be weapons, props, characters, or even entire scenes!With the addition of Live Recording, Pose Blending, and Collada DAE export, you can even use it as a quick-pose tool for your favorite 3D software!Video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GBs1QsuR23D0Lm6mxP_SZJaZ-LyOwZtContent Creation tutorial: http://www.virtuanimator.com/create-content/
