You must build resilient bunkers through 45 levels and in 5 environments including desert, forest, beach, mountains and city ruins, because the next attack wave is already underway! You will know if your bunker is strong enough when the enemies attack with either their artillery, tanks or bombs. Various materials are available to construct your bunkers, such as concrete, steel girders and armor protection.
