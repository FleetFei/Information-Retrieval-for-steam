These aircraft make up an adaptable fleet able to respond to any incident, and form the backbone of rescue operations across the challenging and dangerous arctic region.From searching for lost ships in poor weather, to dramatic landings on frozen tundra and rescuing casualties from a ferocious fire, Arctic Rescue includes 20 challenging missions, calling for you to respond immediately to a wide range of adrenalin-pumping emergencies that will keep you on the edge of your seat. All the missions are fully voiced by a team of professional actors, acting as your co-pilot and mission control, ensuring you will not have to face the rigours of the Arctic alone. Once the “Scramble! Scramble!” message is received over your radio, there is no turning back!Additionally, Arctic Rescue includes scores of custom models and animations such as distressed cargo vessels, road vehicles trapped in the depths of a blizzard, lost hikers, and dramatic burning buildings.
