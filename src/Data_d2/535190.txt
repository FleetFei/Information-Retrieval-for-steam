							Get up-close and personal with Gravity.Chunky Orbits is a simulation of free-floating objects in space based on real life physics. Each object in the scene attracts each of the others in a cosmic tug-of-war that we call Gravity. Toss out a few boulders and contemplate the wonders of the Universe.Check out the Screenshot and Video pages to see what's new. Fill your Universe with a collection of cosmic chunks: boulders, white dwarfs, comets, and chunky fireballs. Add some trails to your rocks to trace their paths. Or bust out the sparkly photon cannon - a delete button with a kick! It's a big physics based playground. Create a random cluster of boulders and watch as they collect into larger, chunky groups. Launch a super-massive White Dwarf and observe how it affects the other bodies in the system. Create a small 'solar system' and see how many chunks you can get into orbit. It's your Universe. Do What You Want. (^_^)There are two versions of the sim. You can pilot a simple spaceship through the void with your gamepad or go full roomscale with your Vive wands or Oculus Touch controllers. The roomscale version features a new kind of 'pinch and pull' movement that makes it easy to move around in 3D space. This isn't a game - more like a physics-based toy. Might even be educational. It certainly gave me a new appreciation for how Gravity works.
