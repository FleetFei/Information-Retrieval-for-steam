							About This Game
							Drink, Shoot or Die! You are caught by zombie apocalypse caused by a virus, which affects only sober people. If you want to stay alive, you have to drink and shoot zombies

Drinking has its own mechanics. If you are close to sober you shoot accurately. When you get more drunk, your accuracy drops, but time begins to run slower. 
You have a scale that measures your drunkenness (also HP because you get sober when zombies hit you). If you get too drunk or too sober - you loose.
When you kill zombies you get points, amount of which depend on your drunkenness level.
