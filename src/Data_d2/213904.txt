							The fully unlocked “Chant of Mul Daya” deck. Other elf tribes shun the Mul Daya, calling them bone-eaters and death-friends. They converse with spirits and honor the jungle like a god. Put on the shaman’s robes and connect to Zendikar’s life force in a way no one else truly understands. In order to summon the massive creatures that populate the jungles of Zendikar, you will need to generate large amounts of mana and this deck allows you to do just that. Ramp up the power and feel the forces of nature infusing you with untold might! Additional content for Magic 2014.
