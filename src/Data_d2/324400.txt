							About This Game
							It's "Clash of the Titans!" Or, rather, "Clash of the Pygmies and Landians!" In cooperation with Bolt Creative, Nine Tales Digital brings you a new spin on their popular Desert Ashes turn-based strategy game, guest starring a powerful Pygmy army defending their territory.  The Desert Ashes Landians have passed through a magical portal to the remote islands of Pocket God. The Landians' victory over the indigenous Pygmies isn't as assured as they think. Even with their futuristic weapons, the Landians face a resourceful foe armed with spearsâ€¦ who are in turn allies with head-hurling zombies and sharks shooting laser beams!
