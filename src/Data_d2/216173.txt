							About This Content
							This is the AirMech Original Soundtrack by Front Line Assembly! Released as a full studio album, it has been mastered and remixed with the same quality as any of their previous albums. Included with this purchase is a set of EXCLUSIVE AirMech content: all four band members as Pilots, and the "Frontline" Warthog Variant. These items are only available when purchased with this soundtrack and will be instantly added to your AirMech account when purchased through Steam.


Front Line Assembly is the primary band of electronic-industrial legend Bill Leeb, whose other projects include Delerium, Skinny Puppy, Noise Unit, among others. Carbon Games approached Bill Leeb with this project because the rich layers of FLA's songs seemed like a perfect fit for dynamic music for AirMech. After a yearlong collaboration, the resulting instrumental tracks covered a wide range of styles and explored new ground for the band.


The resulting music exceeded everyone's expectations. We are excited to be able to offer this full studio album--the same as you can find in retail stores--here on Steam! If you have found this page because you are looking to enter your code you found in a retail CD, you can enter that code ingame under Customize > Store. If you don't have the CD yet, then buy it here and have the exclusive items instantly added to your account.


Sales of the album here benefit Front Line Assembly directly and will count towards their total sales of this album. Carbon Games is providing the exclusive AirMech Variant and Pilot at no additional charge as our way of supporting Front Line Assembly as an independent band. Us independent developers and musicians need to stick together!
