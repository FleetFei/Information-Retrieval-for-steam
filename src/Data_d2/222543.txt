							In 2012, Norfolk Southern celebrated its 30th anniversary and honoured some of the railroads in its history by repainting 20 locomotives in ‘fallen flag’ liveries.Since the 1820s, hundreds of railroad companies were built, merged, reorganised and consolidated into what eventually became Norfolk Southern in 1982. Each livery was modified to fit the GE ES44AC and EMD SD70ACe, while staying as true as possible to the original designs. The heritage liveried locomotives were unveiled in July 2012 and are rostered in NS’ daily freight timetables.The Electro-Motive Division SD70ACe featured in this Heritage Pack is a high powered, single engine diesel locomotive produced since 2004.
