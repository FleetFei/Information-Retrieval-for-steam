							The F-86 Sabre™ was a natural replacement for the F-80 Shooting Star™. First introduced in 1949 for the United States Air Force, the F-86™ featured excellent performance for its day, outstanding handling characteristics, and high adaptability. The Sabre™ served in a number of NATO-aligned countries and was even produced in Canada. A total of 9,860 Sabres of all variants were produced, some of which are still flying today with private collectors. The F-86F-1™ version featured an uprated engine over its predecessors and a larger wing without leading-edge slats.Features Realistic texturing with detailed weathering and rivet detailV-C self-shadowing Pilot and canopy can be ejected (resulting in loss of control)Highly authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controlsAuthentic all-xml 2D panel, hi-res glazed-effect gauges, custom pop-ups for ECU, autopilot and radios, fully mousableTwo separate flight models for clean and loaded modelDetailed checklist and performance that matches that of the real aircraftCustom effects for turbine glow (3-stage), smoke (startup & in-flight), wingtip and flap contrailsHigh quality soundset includedTogglable realistic pilot figureAnimated canopy and entry steps
