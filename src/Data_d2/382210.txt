							Lizardmen race comes with its own unique AI and players (skinks, Saurus and Kroxigor) but also their own star players: Slibli  and Hemlock!

The biggest strength of the Lizardmen lies in two types of key players available: Skinks and Saurus. Skinks are very fast and nimble. Bringing the ball to the goal line is not a problem for them. While very mobile, Saurus are also amazingly powerful. Their role is to breach the enemy's defense line so that Skinks can sneak through with the ball. The Kroxigor is a true mountain of muscle and scales. He adds an important strike force to his team. He is rather fast for his size, which allows him to act quickly. Unfortunately, he sadly lacks in dexterity. The Kroxigor is the player to use when Lizardmen want to hit hard...
