							When first designed in 1947, the Douglas Skyray™ was on the cutting edge of aviation technology. In 1948, Douglas Aircraft™ was contracted to build the F4D-1™, with the first flight of a production model taking place in 1954. Known as the 'ten-minute killer', the aircraft broke five world records in the time-to-altitude category and exceeded Mach 1 in level flight. In 1953, the Skyray™ shared honors with North American's Super Sabre™ in being awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy. In the late 1950s, an F4D1-equipped squadron was recognized as the top interceptor squadron in the North American Air Defense Command, an area previously dominated by Air Force aircraft. In all, Douglas produced 421 Skyrays, including two XF4D™ prototypes. The last of the type left the El Segundo, California, plant in December, 1958. It was designated the F-6A™ in 1963 and served both Marine and Navy carrier squadrons until early 1964.Virtavia’s Douglas F4D Skyray for FSX: Steam Edition comes with four loadout variations (including one clean), various animations, and an awesome smoke trail effect making this a welcome addition to any virtual military fleetFeatures V-C self-shadowing 	4 loadout variations	Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls	Authentic all-xml 2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot and radios, fully mousable	Automatic (on throttle) afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boost	Animated wingfold, tailhook, speedbrakes and 'beaver tail'	Animated canopy (shift-e)	Authentic flight model with checklist	Realistic, animated crew figure	Automatic smoke trail effect	Fully functional landing lights
