With a variety of single player game modes and a simple intuitive control system,  Starfighter Origins offers a fun and diverse modern Space combat simulator.Space Combat EvolvedStarfighter origins builds on the late 90`s space combat simulators with a focus on space combat.  Unlike other games which which concentrate on other aspects of gameplay such as trading, infinite universes and dynamic content and multiplayer.  Star fighter Origins focuses solely on the space combat and keeps the same feel and diversity of titles it was inspired by such as Wing Commander, Freespace and Star Wars.Unique Pick up and play control systemStarfighter origins is easy to get to grips with even if you have never played a space combat simulator before.   The CDF ships use a gravity drive and magnetic drive which gives much better control over the ship compared to the old rocket propulsion system.  While the controls are easy to pick up and get to grips with each ship is different and will take time to master.FEATURES*Single player with 4 fun and diverse Game modes*6 playable ships with different roles/capabilities*Living Cockpit!
