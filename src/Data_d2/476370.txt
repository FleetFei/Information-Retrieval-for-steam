							About This Game
							Game Details: 
-Take up the role of Cello, a brave young girl who wants to protect the land of Yohoo from the influence of another dimension, Wahoo. 
-A short story, roughly 5 to 7 hours to beat. 
-Monsters you encounter are added to the Encyclopedia. See if you can find all of them! 
-"Yohoo" is styled after Europe, and "Wahoo" is styled after Japan. Both names come from Japanese. European-style = Yofuu (洋風)/Japanese-style = Wafuu (和風). The more you know, right? 
-This is intended to be a light and humorous game. Don't expect any gritty realism or dark and dreary twists. Think of it as a light, fluffy snack. Like the game version of strawberry shortcake! 
-I'd love to make a sequel at some point, but, well... We'll see how people like this first! If enough people like it, I'll try to make the sequel a bit larger. (I'm aiming to release this nebulous next one in a year and a half, regardless.) 

Battle System: 
-Classic turn-based combat. 
-A simple but fun battle system. (Honestly, the complexities of recent RPG battle systems drive me crazy. Keep it simple, keep it fun!) 
-A focus on battle tempo, rather than complexity. 
-Only two types of equipment: sword and shield. Equipment weight affects the speed of your actions. 
-Three types of attack: Physical, Fire, and Ice. Every monster has a weak point! 
-Cast spells to damage your enemies or heal.
