							FACE IT is a game about facing the most challenging feelings of the human experience. It uses a dark atmosphere combining classic platform mechanics with survival dynamics to bring the feeling of wandering in the deepest and darkest places of the mind and soul.Defeat Ghosts with the power of your inner light.Face  dangerous traps in a challenging platform experience.Find your way through mazes and puzzles.Through game design techniques, the levels are made to invite you to make a magical and metaphorical trip to your subconscious thoughts and deal with your inner issues. The levels represents dark aspects of human consciousness, like Fear or Attachment. By beating a level, you shall find brighter states of mind, like Love or Truth. As you might pass through the levels, you may unlock the magical sigils and symbols that represent those new brighter states of mind and unlock the keys for the levels from the Darkest World. The sigils are symbolic representations of the magician's desired outcome. They are symbols created to cut through the walls of the conscious thought and affect directly the unconscious mind. It's at some extent, similar to subliminal messages. One of the techniques we use to create sigils is a Sigilization method created by Austin Osman Spare, who was a magician, as well as a painter and graphical artist. The technique consists in writing spells with your intents, and agglutinate the letters to reduce the written statements in abstract symbols. The conscious mind may not remember the meaning of the symbols, but the subconscious keeps the memories about the symbol being made. This way, the symbols and their intents charge each other, exponentially increasing their influence on the mind.
