							StoryOn Dec 25th 1925, a Japanese nationalist revolutionary group staged a coup d’etat. The revolutionaries acted swiftly, suppressing the prime minister, police, major corporations, and newspapers. Struggling to react, the old government faction sent the order to a secret information organization ‘Igasei’ to initiate an assassination program called ‘Yatagarasu’ and eliminate the leaders of the coup d’etat.OverviewYatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm is an original, traditional-style 2D fighting game with 11 playable characters that takes heavy inspiration from Street Fighter III, focusing on delivering solid game play and high quality production values.The control mechanics are simple and readily accessible to anyone, but gameplay is based around reading your opponent, parrying and countering, and is deep enough to provide an enjoyable challenge for even seasoned fighting game veterans.Dynamic CommentaryYatagarasu AoC features a unique commentary system which provides tournament-style real-time commentary based on developments in the match. Both Japanese and English dynamic commentaries (audio and subtitles) are available and providing the English commentary are veteran commentators Jchensor, UltraDavid, and Maximilian.Other FeaturesOther features include online play with rank matches, lobby matches, online leaderboards, tournament play, Twitter integration, a fully-featured training mode, and GGPO to follow in an upcoming update.Creative Talent★ Yatagarasu AoC features 2D pixel art by KOTANI:Tomoyuki AKA Styleos (King of Fighters, Mushihimesama, Ibara), and arresting character art by Miwa Shirow (Dogs, Black Mind) and Yasuda Suzuhito (Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor).★ Voice acting talent includes Kaji Yuki (Attack on Titan, Final Fantasy XIII, Genso Suikoden), Uchida Maaya (IDOLM@STER, Holy Knight), and TOUGEKI announcer Koori Masoi.★ The Yatagarasu soundtrack is created by Raito (Melty Blood, Under Night In-birth) and performed by the renowned doujin songstress LIQU@.[/list]
