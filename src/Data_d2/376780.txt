							Inspector Smythe from Scotland Yard has informed Watson and me of the murder of General Armstead, a Tontine ticket holder. Of course, I was aware of the Tontine – a lottery that was set up to aid the veterans of the Battle of Waterloo. Something about this case intrigues me. Perhaps it ís that there are only five surviving ticket holders here in London? Perhaps it ís that the General was about to publish a scintillating addendum to his infamous book on treasure.Zojoi teamed up with famed board game company Sleuth Times to reproduce the award-winning Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective video mysteries for Windows and Mac.
