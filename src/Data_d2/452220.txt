							What if we told you there were “countries” the size of the average suburban household? What if they had their own rules, laws, and even currencies? What if we told you one of them almost brought the entire Internet to its knees in a single day? These are data havens. And they are the Switzerlands of the Internet. These bunkers, caves, and sea fortresses offer cybercriminals and freedom fighters alike the privacy to conduct unregulated information exchanges, malware attacks, spam dumps, ransomware breaches, and hosting. Almost every cybercriminal walks these halls, virtually or literally. Here today, gone tomorrow, misdirecting and re-emerging in similar shelters, away from prying eyes, and unaffected by 20-megaton blasts. These independent micro-nations are the only true providers of online privacy, offering 100% anonymity without any government restrictions. Welcome to The Most Dangerous Town on the Internet.
