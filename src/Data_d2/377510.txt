							About This Game
							XField Paintball studio is a small team of veteran developers and paintball pros dedicated to making a very immersive paintball game, real time multiplayer, extremely fun to play, whether you play paintball in real life or not. It is powered by a custom designed FPSâ€“sport hybrid engine specially created for this PC game.

XField Paintball 3 is the official game for all international paintball and scenario leagues. It  will offer new competition layouts ingame before competitions take place (20 per year). The game will also have a scenario map inspired by Hollywood SC Village. New scenario maps will be added quaterly.

It is a fast paced tactical multiplayer shooter game. Players will use coordination, communication and marksmanship skill to win either by eliminating all adversaries or by hitting the buzz button on the other side of the field. The game is a sport FPS that requires team spirit, strategy, tactic and parabolic shooting skills. Ground occupation, situation assessment skills, protection, cross fire, and speed are key to win.

The game comes out with many modes and several layouts (4 competitions and 1 scenario) to avoid everyone waiting too long. We will open the 5 on 5 and 1 on 1 quick play modes first and open more options as the number of players increase. The main initial focus is on the paintball gameplay. We will then open quickly more options and make regular updates, including playing with friends, ranking and creating your field. The road map will be made available to the community.

Our 2017 objective is to create the right conditions to start majors leagues e-sport competitions. Be ready. Train as much as you can before you create your team.
