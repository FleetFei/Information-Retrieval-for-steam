							About This Game
							Dead End Road is an atmospheric driving game, with a low-fi aesthetic, perma-death and procedurally generated elements - Designed for multiple short "runs", featuring a unique "wish fulfilment" text parser system to generate a new ending each play-through.

You had been warned not to dabble in the occult, not to trifle with ancient knowledge that you could not possibly hope to understand. Yet you opened Pandora's box, and you did not like what you found inside. 

Now something is pursuing you, terrorising you - Something that isn't bound to the rules of our reality. Ghosts? Some sort of demon? You wish you knew, although part of you is also glad you don't. What you do know is that you have to finish what you started - and fast. 

Terrified and desperate, the only thing you can think of is to seek the assistance of the old woman who first told you of the ritual. She is the only one who can help you end this nightmare.
