STORY

Times are hard in Pelora. Queen Jezebel rules the island of Belsar with an iron fist, aided by the relentless Empire. The brother-kings Kalan and Abel oppose the Empire on the mainland, but with few troops, their resistance is soon to falter. And there are rumors that the ancient cult of Brax has risen again to stir dark magics.

But there is hope. The Belsarian people, desperate for justice, rally around an unlikely revolutionary leader: Rachel. She is Achab's illegitimate daughter. And at her side rise heroes brimming with courage, power and resolve.

Will Rachel defeat her stepmother and free her country? And what of Brax and the Empire? Only you can answer these questions.
