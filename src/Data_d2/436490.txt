							About This Game
							Enter a realm of enchantment with "FIREBIRD - La Péri", and play the role of Iskender, a prince seeking the "flower of immortality". You will appear on the stage, visit the ethereal world of La Péri, and witness a magical and poetic encounter as one of the characters... As you try to take possession of the precious flower, guardian spirits will gradually appear. Strive to get the petals of the flower from them and awaken La Péri, a mesmerizing feminine silhouette covered in light. Her dance will dazzle you, but will you be moved enough to give up immortality and let the Péri live ?

“La Péri” is a VR experience based on classical music and ballet by composer Paul Dukas and starring John Rhys-Davies as the Narrator. It relies heavily on the Vive's hand controllers, and will enable you to interact directly with the characters and creatures which populate this world. In this unique and visually stunning production by the award-winning french VR studio Innerspace, choreography, music, story-line and the most high-end technology will merge into one, producing an extraordinary audio-visual experience.
