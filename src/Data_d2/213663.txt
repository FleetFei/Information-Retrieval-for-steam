							Product description:  This is the Endless Mode Pack for Dwarfs!? This one is for all those Dwarfs-lovers who just don't get enough time with their Dwarfs. If you have played the 5-minute game, the 15-minute game, the 30-minute game AND the 60-minute game and still need more time - this is the pack for you. This will open up the Endless mode, which is, well... Endless. No time limits. Just play as long as you can! The challenge is no longer to see how big a score you can get in the time - it is just how big a score can you get!

And remember - the core game is always FREE! You buy the add-on packs once and can play them with no restrictions, for ever after!
