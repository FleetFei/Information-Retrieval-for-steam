							Fujiwara Toru is a transfer student. At first glance he seems to be a generic, awkward teenager, but there is more to him than meets the eye.

Sangu academy has a tradition called Ren. each year student choose a different grade partner, and all non partnered people are alone. One other thing - there can be no same sex pairs.

The Gemma Februarii- the jewel of February- is the mysterious prize that each year the winner of the Ren competition will get to temporarily keep in their possession. It's mysterious charm was enough to bring 1st year student Rita Glengold all the way from Scotland to Japan.

Will Toru's talents help him find a partner? Can he win the battle of Ren and get the prize of Gemma Februarii?
