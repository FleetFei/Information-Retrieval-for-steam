So it can be a while between updates. So with that in mind I decided to include the full game in the demo until the game is more polished.Hand made beatmapsEvery song in this game have their notes placed out by hand, so it insure to be perfectly synced with the music.It also allows importing of Osu!mania and Stepmania songs, So you have tens of thousands of songs to choose from.
