							Five places to fly for peace, quiet and plenty of bracing North Sea air.These five airports on the islands of Baltrum, Borkum, Juist, Langeoog and Norderney are all part of the East Frisian Islands, situated off the coasts of Germany and Holland.Borkum is the largest of the islands, located just 30 kilometres from the mainland, and is Germany’s most north-westerly point. Although an island for Whalers and Pirates in the past, it is now part of a National Park, as indeed are all the islands, and is an unspoilt place to escape to. The island’s airport is just one metre above sea level and has one asphalt runway exactly one kilometre long. It also has two grass runways just short of a kilometre each.Baltrum is known as the sleeping beauty of the North Sea and is the smallest of the islands, whereas Juist is the longest at 17 kilometres and is only seven kilometres from the mainland.Norderley has special UNESCO World Heritage Status and Langeoog makes up the fifth island. Each of these islands boasts its own airport, ideal for island hoping with 20 combinations for different take-off and landing places.FeaturesHigh-res ground polygonPhoto-real layout and textures (25cm resolution)Hand placed hi-resolution buildings within airport boundariesCustom auto-gen buildings outside the airport boundaryExtensive library of airport clutterAccurate taxiway lanesCustom made static aircraftCustom night-lightingCompatible with Default and Orbx Global
