The team had noticed that many elementary school kids are afraid of math, and tried to figure out how we can ease up the situation in our own small way. Perhaps creating a math RPG could be a fun experiment, we thought. The game was tested by kids ages 10 and below, and just before graduating, the team decided to push for publication. We were joined by Asia Pacific College interns for the music and quality assurance.OUR TEAM:Lead Designer: Steven EscarlanLevel Designer: Blue VergaraProgrammer: Francisco BateExterior Tile Artist: Jeremy PlanaComposer: Nhyne JunioLead QA: Neil AlcuranProducer/Programmer/Designer: Arvin D.
