							Reiner Knizia’s The Confrontation is a turn-based strategy game pitting two players, Light and Shadow, against one another with asymmetric forces and hidden units.Play as the beleaguered Light, embarking on a desperate quest to save the kingdom from the evil sorcery that has fallen over the land. Carefully guide your forces across the board, avoiding the awaiting dark side armies, and lead your Prince to the Stronghold to defeat evil at its source.Play as the loathsome Shadow, rampaging across the land, destroying any Light character within your path. Seek out and destroy the Prince before he can succeed in his quest, or lay siege to the Capital with 3 of your units to conquer Light at its heart.Deploy your forces, each with its own unique power, and fight your way through the land, using cards in combat to increase your strength or perform tactical feats to outwit your foe. Exploit special features throughout the landscape and powerful spells to navigate around enemy forces or ambush them as they attempt to reach their goal. Many will perish along the way, but will their sacrifices be in vain?Like many of Knizia’s designs, The Confrontation can be played casually between beginners or fiercely between master strategists – it’s up to you and your opponents!GAME FEATURES  Solo play versus multiple AI opponents.  Realtime online multiplayer.
