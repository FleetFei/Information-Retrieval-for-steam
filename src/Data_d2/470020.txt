							Play as Snarf, a Zeetvah from Zeetville on an epic quest for fame and fortune. (Mostly fortune.) Can you help Snarf earn the gold, help the woman, and win his place on the throne?

SnarfQuest Tales is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by the style of such classics as the King's Quest series, Myst, and The Secret of Monkey Island. SnarfQuest Tales: Episode One is the first chapter of five planned adventures featuring Snarf, Larry Elmore's lovable adventurer. For the first time, SnarfQuest fans will interact with the beautiful Telerie Windyarm and Prince Raffendorf they know from the comics.
