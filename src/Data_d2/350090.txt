							In No Pineapple Left Behind, you have to run a school full of children. Children have lots of wants, needs, and feelings. That's a problem, because if they get don't pay attention in class and get low grades, your school loses money. However, you can turn children into pineapples. All that pineapples do is take tests and get grades. They do not have feelings and are not people, but they are much simpler to handle, and therefore much cheaper.Features:Learn about the shortcomings of modern education in this satirical gameNine schools, each with unique challengesManage the school's curriculums, students, and staff without going bankruptDehumanize the children, turning them into orderly pineapplesMaintain a small staff of top-tier teachers or a large group of burned-out, underpaid teachersManipulate a child's feelings with lasersCast magic spells like "Trigonomancy" or "Covalency" to teach studentsAddress parental concerns, or maybe ignore them altogether
