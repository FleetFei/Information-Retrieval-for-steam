							About This Game
							Fantastic 4 In A Row 2 is a modern version of the timeless classic, played on a distant planet with beautiful graphics and music. Participating players take turns dropping colored discs from the top of the screen into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. The game includes 4 levels of difficulty in single-player mode, a 2-player mode and even comes with a unique 3- and 4-player mode using multi-sided grids. Your winning row can now wrap around the sides in 3D! This is a great way to play with family or a group of friends taking the experience to brand new levels.KEY FEATURESClassic Four-In-A-Row reinventedBeautiful 3D graphics and effectsWonderful audio and musicSingle-player mode with 4 levels of difficultyLocal turn-based 2-player modeLocal turn-based 3- and 4-player modes on multi-sided grids
