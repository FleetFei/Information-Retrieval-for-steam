							The L-39 Albatros is a low-wing, high-performance jet aircraft that doubles as a trainer and light attack aircraft. The Albatros was developed in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s to replace older L-29 jet trainers. Powered by an Ivchenko AI-25TL turbofan engine, the L-39 has a top speed of Mach 0.80, a service ceiling of 11,000 m (36,100 feet), and can pull up to 8 G. Although primarily used as a trainer and light attack aircraft, the L-39 has also become popular with several aerial acrobatics demonstration teams.Being a trainer aircraft, the L-39C has a tandem cockpit with the student in front and the instructor in the back. The instructor has several controls to mimic system failures to test the student. The L-39C also has two underwing pylons for bombs, rockets and close range air-to-air missiles. For decades, the L-39 was used by nations around the world to train pilots that later went on to fly aircraft like the MiG-29 and Su-27.A later evolution of the L-39 was the L-39ZA light attack aircraft. The ZA adds two additional weapon pylons and a center pylon to mount a gun pod. The ZA has proved a popular choice for low-intensity conflicts. The L-39ZA will be available later during the Open Beta.NOTE: DCS: L-39 Albatros requires the DCS World 1.5 Open Beta!Key features of the DCS: L-39 Albatros:Professional Flight Model that accurately mimics the performance and flight characteristics of this legendary trainerHighly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpitInteract with cockpit controls with your mouseFully modelled weapon systemsAccurate L-39C and L-39ZA models with correct country markingsDetailed modelling of the L-39 instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel, electrical and hydraulic systemsFly from either the front seat or back seatCooperative multiplayer in the same aircraft
