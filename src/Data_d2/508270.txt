							Like the embrace of a loved one, the Pan-Pan soundtrack envelops you in a 45 minute mix of other worldly sounds, synths and melodies. Lovingly crafted by renowned sound composer, Simon Viklund from Payday fame, the soundtrack captures the ethereal feel of the gaming experience and blends it with a healthy sprinkling of old school puzzle based platforming nostalgia.It's your soundtrack to life in space!Track listPan-Pan Main ThemeCrash Site (Outpost 351)Ship Assembly (Take 1)The LawnDesert (Take 1)Battery PuzzleDesert AppendixShip Assembly (Take 2)Desert Appendix RevisitedGem CaveDesert (Take 2, 3 & 4)My LullabyFrog PassageCrab CaveMimic PuzzleForest: MysteriousForest: FriendlyShip Assembly (Take 2)LagoonEye PuzzleStone Face CaveCrash Site RevisitedDerilict Ship CaveDistant ShoreLagoon RevisitedShip Assembly (Take 3, 4 & 5)Pan-Pan Main Theme (Credits Version)-----------------------------------------------------The soundtrack is located in the sub-folder called ”Soundtrack” (directly under the Pan-Pan root folder)-----------------------------------------------------
