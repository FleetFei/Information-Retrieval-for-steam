							About This Game
							During an exclusive tour of the "Science Lab of Creating Viruses that can Murder the hell out of Humanity for Science Reasons" an excitable Australian broke a vial, labeled "The Good Stuff". It unleashed some of the deadliest viruses known to humankind...

Dr. Boffpow, the not senile scientist sprung into action creating an "extremely viable" solution to the outbreak. 

The Virus Scanner, which shows where viruses are located. 
The Virus Magnifier, a glass box that contains and magnifies the viruses.
A ball of drugs. Similar to a bouncy ball, but with pharmaceutical goodness.
