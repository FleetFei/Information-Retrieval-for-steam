With a focus on active play, a few rounds of Boost is sure to wake you up and get your blood pumping!Teleoperate your Luma-Jock in the 3rd Galactic Quadrant's finest arena.  Use your Luma-shield to Thwonk the Booster Orb and keep the rally going as long as possible.  Every four returns you'll achieve a Boost and the orb will increase its speed.  Keep it up for long and you'll be rallying with your opponent at near relativistic velocities!  Watch out for Mines as you leap and dive for survival.  Mines have a reverse photon charge and will destroy your Luma-shield and the Orb on contact.  Not to worry!  Your Tele-gloves have a positive charge and you can use them to bat Mines out of the way.  However, be warned that Mines will accumulate with every Boost and you'll need to keep their numbers low if you want to prevail.FeaturesContext sensitive sound track that intensifies as you playTracked motion controls provide a physics based full immersion experienceIntuitive physical UI system designed around the strengths of VRHeight calibration to accommodate all playersMultiple control configurationsAim Assist mode provides visual feedback for beginnersDesigned with a strong focus on play mechanics that are specifically suited for VRGraphically rich environment featuring numerous animated textures, glow effects and a sense of enormous scaleExperience the buzz of a natural endorphin release after extended play sessionsComing soonAsymmetric Multiplayer: player two contends with a gamepad or mouse while player one competes in VROnline leader boardsAdjust play space size optionAchievements
