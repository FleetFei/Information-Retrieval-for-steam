							New emission standards for diesel locomotives in the US introduced in 2005 saw many new locomotives enter service to replace more ageing fleets, including the Evolution Series of locomotives and the ES44DC, now available for Train Simulator.The first pre-production models of the GE Evolution Series were built in 2003 and were equipped with either AC or DC traction motors, according to the customer’s request. Four models in the Series were produced for the North American market, the ES40DC, ES44DC, ES44AC and ES44C4, all with a low emission four-stroke diesel engine.The ES44DC replaced the Dash 9-44CW model in GE’s locomotive roster, and are similar in appearance to the Dash 9 and AC4400CW, although small differences are evident. In total, more than 1,100 models were built primarily for BNSF, CSX Transportation and the Canadian National Railway. Barring those damaged in accidents, the models still continue hauling freight services to this day.The EMD ES44DC for Train Simulator is available in BNSF Heritage livery and features dynamic braking, cab lighting, step lights and associated freight cars, including a coal hopper, pipe flat car and tank car.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BNSF ES44DC on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
