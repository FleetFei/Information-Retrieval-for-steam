							FIGHT ZOMBIES...WITH SCIENCE!

Dead Stop is a manic, mad-science filled zombie tower defence game that would even have Einstein reaching for his 'How to deal with a Zombie Invasion' handbook! 

IT'S ALIVE! OHâ€¦OH NO IT'S DEAD
The undead have sprouted from their graves and you must help a lone mad scientist stop them. Use his crazy contraptions to send the undead back to ground and save the survivors.

WEAPONS OF MAD DESTRUCTION
Whether it's an electric-powered machine gun or a deadly laser made out of an old oven, you'll be dealing destruction to the undead hordes in style. 

UNDEAD ON TOUR
Travel to various locations as you push the undead hordes back. Gameplay gets spiced up with the inclusion of zombie maze games as well as survival modes for each location. How long can you last?
