							A famous name from the 1940s comes to FSX: Steam Edition! The Hawker Hurricane lost out somewhat in the fame stakes to the much more renowned Spitfire, but the reality is that Hurricanes proved more effective than Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. It was a more robust aircraft, and its fabric-over-frame construction meant that it was cheaper and quicker to build and repair than the Spitfire with its monocoque all-metal construction. The prototype first flew on the 6th November, 1935, and the aircraft was steadily improved and altered to eventual production standard. Developed by Just Flight, Battle of Britain Hurricane add-on for FSX: Steam Edition includes three versions of this remarkable aircraft, from the Prototype through the early Mk1 two-bladed Rotol propeller version to the Mk1's more refined three-bladed propeller type. With an incredibly detailed cockpit, several model variations, exacting flight dynamics, realistic engine sounds and top quality paint schemes, the Hurricane makes an ideal stablemate for its famous sister, the Supermarine Spitfire (also available in the FSX: Steam Edition store).Features:	Highly detailed exterior models 	High quality interactive 3D Virtual Cockpit 	Realistic sounds 	Canopy jettison feature 	11 authentic liveries 	Animated pilot figure 	Detailed Merlin engine visible 	Numerous animations 	High fidelity flight model 	Detailed manual 	Engine start and gun effects 	Multiple viewpoints 	Opening inspection hatches and a fully detailed exterior cockpit 	Removable features include fuel tank cover, inspection panel on starboard side and gun hatches on wingIncludes Hawker Hurricane  Mk1 'Battle of France' period model with wooden two-bladed propeller, ring-and-bead gun sight, fabric wings as well as Hawker Hurricane Mk1 'Battle of Britain' period modelInterior models recreating early Hurricane with ring-and-bead gun sight as well as Mk1 production cockpit with reflector gunsight	Exterior models built following the most accurate plans available, to achieve highly accurate profiles and shapes 	Features modelled fabric over stringer rear fuselage 	Specular and bump mapped where appropriate 	Engine start battery trolley	Virtual cockpits completely modelled to portray the real cockpit in full detail 	Every switch, knob and lever works, most with bespoke animation code 	Shadow textured where appropriate 	Animations include sliding canopy, animated pilot figure, canopy jettison feature, undercarriage, movable radiator flap, retracting foot step and hand grabs, flaps, rudder, elevators, ailerons and trim tabs	Fuel tank cover can be removed to reveal tank, supply pipes and fittings 	Inspection panel on starboard side can be removed to reveal cockpit detail 	Gun hatches on wing can be removed to reveal Browning machine guns, ammunition feeders and fully modelled shells 	Special effects include engine start smoke effect and gun firing effects and sounds	Highly detailed texture mapping without compromising frame rates 	Layered paint kit included to help create your own liveries (suitable additional paint program such as Photoshop required)
