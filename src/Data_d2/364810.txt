							About This Game
							There is a place in the galaxy where legends are born...Kirk, Chekov, Sulu.  Before they were legends, they were cadets at the most celebrated training facility in the Universe -- Starfleet Academy!Now it's your turn. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy includes over 25 missions designed to test your ingenuity, leadership and courage -- and determine if you have what it takes to graduate first in your class.  Going where no simulator has gone before, you'll take on 30 of the universe's finest starships, from the cloaking Klingon Bird-of-Prey to the Romulan heavy cruiser.  To succeed, you must pass all the simulated missions, from simple combat situations, to a recreation of Kirk's near-disastrous  confrontation with Khan Noonien Singh, to the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario.  All the while, Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Captain Sulu (featuring a special appearance by George Takei), will be there to provide instruction and inspiration!
