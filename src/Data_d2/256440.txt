							About This Game
							Monsters & Munitions is a physics-based Collectible Card Game (CCG) that has you firing devastating shots at your enemies.

Shuffle up your deck, pick your artillery, and face off against the maniacal Dr. Frank and his monster army in Monsters & Munitions. Send Dr. Frank and his monsters back into the dark ages with the help of your trusty tank, blasting a wide array of over 80 different munitions that can be boosted and leveled up for even more monster exploding fun in this explosive physics-based CCG!

Annihilate your foes through a world of destructible environments and structures where monsters surround explosive barrels, volatile lab equipment and other incendiaries just begging to be ignited. As you progress, you can build up your card deck to gain access to new levels and improved weapons that will give you the upper hand in your quest for total monster domination. Monsters & Munitions is just what the evil doctor ordered to satiate your thirst for explosions, destruction, and mayhem against monsters.
