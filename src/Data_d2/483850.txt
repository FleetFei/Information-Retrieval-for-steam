							About This Game
							Guns N’ Boxes is a top-down single screen arena-style multiplayer shooter in which you shoot boxes, collect random weapons and use special items to unleash destruction upon everything that moves! Choose your favorite character from across the space-time continuum and duke it out using rifles, hot dog launchers, rail guns, tomatoes, arrows and tons of other weapons. 

Pick-up-and-play!

Guns N' Boxes is surprisingly easy to pick up and play with your friends. Learning the basics takes a minute, but becoming an expert takes lots of effort. Foes of all skill levels will feel welcome in Guns N' Boxes.

Multiplayer Frenzy!

Brought friends? No problem! Up to 4 player local and online competitive modes. Fight for survival and prove your skills against the internet. Outshoot your foes, run for cover and become the best in this non-stop, wacky multiplayer gauntlet of bullets!

A Classic Charm

Pixel Art-style aesthetic and animations made with more love than your grandmother's cookies. Modern visuals with a classic feel that will take you back to the 16-bit era as if time hadn’t gone by. Guns N’ Boxes is some sort of a... "neoclassic" with unrelenting action to sate your thirst for adrenaline in pixels.

Pistols, Rifles, Foodstuffs and more!

Arm yoursef with the myriad weapons that are hidden within the boxes! Quick-firing pistols, foe-smiting railguns, exploding hot dogs and many other kinds of armaments can be used to wreak havoc around you. Master and fire laser beams, grenades and shotguns as you adapt to your situation. Oh wait... such a pity they all drop randomly!
