							The Robinson O4 is a workhorse from the days of British steam, and you can now drive this faithful old ‘kettle’ in Train Simulator, with scenarios specially created for the Woodhead Line. The O4 has its origins in the Great Central Railway Class 8K 2-8-0 steam locomotive, of which the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) acquired more than 300 examples under the grouping process between 1923 and 1927. Using the 8K as a basis, John G. Robinson developed the O4 utilising a super-heated boiler and larger cylinders and valve gear, then adding a front pony truck to carry the extra weight. Used for hauling heavy freight trains, the O4s proved their capabilities and 92 were requisitioned for war work in the Middle East in 1941, with many more 300 remaining in service in the UK until final withdrawal of the class in 1966. The O4 for Train Simulator is highly-detailed with realistic sounds and controls including operating cylinder cocks – just watch out for the clouds of steam!Key FeaturesRobinson O4 steam locomotive in British Railways black livery with lion-and-wheel emblem4 scenarios for the   Woodhead LineQuick Drive compatibleCheck out additional Robinson O4 routes on the Steam Workshop!
