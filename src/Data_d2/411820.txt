							This is Virtual Reality! The FOO Show is a 3D rendered, interactive talk show, featuring Will Smith. Every week, starting this summer, Will will chat with interesting people from the world of games, virtual reality, film, television, and more, and you can come along. This week's episode features Firewatch. You can explore the fire watchtower in room-scale (or standing) VR! The FOO Show is just our first program. In the next year, we'll introduce many new shows.
