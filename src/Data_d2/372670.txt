							About This Game
							The journey begins with four silent protagonists. They go into dungeons, fight 
enemies, defeat bosses, and level up. But, is that all there is to their lives? 
Meanwhile, in the real world, a group of bored game designers are looking 
to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. Will your protagonists 
simply fight respawning enemies for all of eternity or will they achieve 
greater things? (Intended to be part 1 of a trilogy).

This is a game for those that like snes-era rpgs and dungeon crawlers.
