							“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.”-H.P. LovecraftH.P. Lovecraft is the founding father of modern horror, and nobody has been able to plumb the raw, emotional, fear-filled depths of the human psyche the way he has.
