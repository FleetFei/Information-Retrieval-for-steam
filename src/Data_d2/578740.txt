							STORYSomething has happened to humanity. You are the last man on Earth. As a microbiologist, you possess the knowledge and skills needed to unravel the mystery and save the human race. Unfortunately, the materials needed to perform your experiments are far from your rural home and scattered across the nearest city. Even worse, creatures roam the streets and buildings you need to search in order to locate ammo, food, fuel, and DNA for research. As you gather supplies during the relative safety of the day, you must return home every night to stockpile supplies, re-fuel your generator, and stay safe from the dangers lurking outside.Gameplay: Why procedurally generation?The core gameplay loop of this game is risk vs reward. As you explore buildings for supplies, you never know what will be around the corner. Will there be a fire escape on this floor if I get cornered by enemies? Will there be a ton of ammo behind that door, or several enemies to encounter? You will never know as the building design is randomly generated. As you gather supplies and explore what has happened in this world, you will want to return home before dying or you will lose the supplies on your person at that moment. Mankind needs your help! As you explore deeper, you will find DNA that might be a link to saving humanity. FEATURES•	Open-Exploration•	Explore Procedurally Generated Buildings•	Precision Aiming Combat•	Atmospheric Style
