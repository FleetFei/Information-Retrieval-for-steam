							About This Game
							Welcome to Elsewhere High, "a school for exceptional children."

In this visual novel, players are able to immerse themselves in the world of the outcast. Each student at Elsewhere High has fallen short of expectations at their original high school; they've flunked out, skipped class, wrote threatening notes, or grew to be a reprehensible bully. Friendships spawn, and feuds arise, but amidst the teen drama and angst it quickly becomes clear that Elsewhere is much, much more than it seems. 

Chapter one is the free first chapter in a planned multi-chapter series. Subsequent chapters will be sold at a small cost.

Largely kinetic, Elsewhere High allows players to make various choices that lead them down intermittently varying paths. Each reader will reach the same destination, but is able to make small choices that affect individual scenes rather than the arching narrative.
