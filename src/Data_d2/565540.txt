							The Turkey of Christmas Past is a third person, swordplay orientated, action game about Tom de Cat, master swordsman, and his one cat stand against the Turkey menace. With a fowl army hell bent on destroying Christmas, Tom is our last and only hope. 

The Turkey of Christmas Past is set in turkey HQ with a zombie like mechanic. Tom must use all of his abilities, including swordplay, ranged attacks, mousetraps, and his inner Felid Power, to prevail. 

The game features high quality environments and models, motion captured animations, and an original soundtrack. It blends frantic gameplay and epic action with a touch of absurdist humour. Caution: May Contain Turkey
