							In Drizzlepath you are set on a journey to the top of the Mountain of Fire. This game is what you'd call a "walking simulator". It aims to be an atmospheric, relaxed and enigmatic experience. It was made in CryEngine 3 to achieve an immersive graphic quality. If you enjoy games that are about the experience of discovering of the world around you, you will probably love Drizzlepath.

When you download the game, you also have the game's OST in your "...Steam\steamapps\common\Drizzlepath\Drizzlepath OST" folder.

Note: Drizzlepath is a short game and has no save feature. The checkpoint system in game is for situations like getting stuck in a hole or dying by falling down from high grounds. It only works in game session and resets when you quit game to main menu or desktop.
