							Demon Hearts is a 2D platformer game that will leave you feeling blood thirsty for victory every time you play! Take the winged and dangerously swift Vampiress Snow, through many challenging silhouette environments while withstanding the many divergent demons, evil forces, and bosses you will stumble across. Be vigilant to your surroundings as you traverse through many puzzling levels and transform into invincible blood sucking bats to battle your way through each checkpoint! Use your remorseless katana skills to find each level's Demon Heart and then cut into its flesh to advance to the next level! Will you slay all the Demon Hearts? Will you slay them faster than your friends? Will you become the ultimate Demon Heart slayer?Music by Phat Boi J: http://phatboij.newgrounds.com/Download the Soundtrack on http://demonhearts.com* 50+ Levels* Unlockable Characters* Timed Levels For Speed Running Fun!* Bumpin Trance Soundtrack* Steam Achievements* Steam Trading Cards* Drippy Pink Blood* Active Developer Support
