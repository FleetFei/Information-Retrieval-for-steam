							About This Game
							Vanishing Realms: Rite of Steel is an immersive Role Playing Game designed from the ground up for Virtual Reality play.  Use one-to-one motion controls and movement so that you are fully in control of combat.  To swing, duck and block, you don't hit a button, but physically move to perform these actions as if you were there - because you are!  Treasure chests, weapon shops, a horde of undead foes, mystic writings, banished gods, lost artifacts, ancient tombs and moonlit forest - it's all here waiting to be discovered in a beautifully hand-crafted VR realm.   Battle life-sized monsters in stunning, face-to-face melee and magical combat.  Hold weapons directly in your hands, learn to block enemy strikes, seek openings in their armor and defenses and strike back.  The longer you play Vanishing Realms, the more you'll hone your physical skills.  You'll take on more powerful and advanced enemies as you move deeper into the world.Explore, Discover, Collect, Solve, Play.  Directly interact and move freely through a rich and varied fantasy world.  Vanishing Realms combines the long tradition of hand-crafted game design with the intuitive and immersive experiences made possible through Virtual Reality and hand-held tracked controllers. Surround yourself with Adventure.  Pause to take in the moonlit vista before you.  Rest beneath a gnarled apple tree - it's good to see the night sky again.  How long have you been fighting and exploring in this place? Rummage in your backpack, take a few bites of bread and cheese, drink a healing draught, think of all you've seen and...is something moving over there...on the tree line, beyond the rock outcropping?
