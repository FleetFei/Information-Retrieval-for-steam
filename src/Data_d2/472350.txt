							It's time to get your hands on the Club Starter Pack DLC! This unique add on will give you access to a whole host of new content through unlimited access to the special Club Arenas. These Arenas feature exciting new game modes not available in standard Arenas or game modes. Send Bloons earlier and faster in the Speed Mode Arena, plan your upgrades wisely in Mega Boosts and be prepared to handle your own heat in Play With Fire. All of these exciting game modes and more are available once you unlock Club Access.

That's not all though, this DLC also contains a huge value pack of Medallions, Energy and Decals - exclusive to this add on.

The Club Starter Pack contains:

* Unlimited Club Access (which also grants a permanent 2x medallions on all future purchases).
* 5000 Medallions.
* A Large Energy Potion (50 energy).
* 5 exclusive decals to show off on the battlefield (Angry, Smile, Nuked, Super Monkey, LOL).
