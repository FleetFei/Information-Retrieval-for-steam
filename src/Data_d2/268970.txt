							When was the last time you played a game, any game really, where you walked into someone's home, nonchalantly opened drawers, cabinets, picked locks, upturned a bed and talked to the freaking homeowner in hopes of finding something you could loot? Oh, right before this game? Yeah I thought so. Aside from more humble games like Skyrim, where you had to steal items instead of taking them, every game that has item management lets you play the bad guy without being the bad guy.

Let me tell you something: NPCs hate your guts, they just can't say it to your face! Just cleared a forest of roving bandits? Well they were the only ones keeping a population of meerkats in check. The local farms can't keep them at bay and you've just triggered the worst national food shortage in the past decade. Good job, hero! I think it's time for some payback.

You Are Not The Hero is a 2D Action Platform RPG that ditches the battle system to focus on richer RPG gameplay elements. Instead of playing a traditional hero that saves the world, you're playing a bystander swept into the affairs of heroes and villains alike.

You play as Petula, an unemployed, emotionally charged, ill-tempered, otherwise average young woman. With the royal army hot on their heels, the heroes have made their way to your village where they begin scavenging for supplies in everyone's homes. After you confront them for stealing your pendant, they rush off to continue their quest, giving you a quest of your own to retrieve it.
