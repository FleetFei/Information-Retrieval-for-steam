Each ‘Drum Session’ contains all the parts you’ll need to create your song (Verse, Chorus, Fills etc). Simply choose a drum session that matches your tempo and feel, then drag and drop the parts into your sequencer software and arrange as you like to create professional drum tracks in seconds. Mix and match loops from different sets and use the full single-hit collection to add crash cymbals, kicks or extras to the loops to increase realism or build your own custom kits. For high quality, ready-to-rock drum tracks, check out our Stereo Loops available in Acid WAV, Apple Loops, REX2 or Stylus RMX format. For more control - and to create your own custom drum mixes - we recommend the matching Multi-Track libraries, enabling you to add effects and EQ to the individual drum tracks. Either way, they’re simple to use, and sound fantastic.
