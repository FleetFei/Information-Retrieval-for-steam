							4 new army lists are added to the Skirmish mode of Sengoku Jidai, introducing a Yuan army list (Mongol Invasion) and 3 Japanese ones (Hojo and two generic clans called Aoi and Akai). This skirmish module allows you to experience the very different tactics of late 13th century Japanese warfare both against the Mongol invaders and against other Japanese clans.
