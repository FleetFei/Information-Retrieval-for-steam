							About This Game
							Fergus was caught by spiders and almost became their lunch. But he’s not giving up! Even being completely wrapped up in a web, our hero doesn’t lose courage, and continues moving, hanging on for his dear life!

Fergus isn’t the only one strayed in these gloomy rooms: a couple fireflies also couldn’t find an exit. Help Fergus pass all tests, save the fireflies and find a way out.

In this game you’ll have a long and hard journey through the abandoned house, filled with danger. You’ll have to guide the brave fly past the ingenious traps, outsmart the enemies and save those poor fireflies.

We hope that you have enough energy, nerves and savvy to get Fergus out of the scrape. Good luck!
