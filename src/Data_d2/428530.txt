							About This Game
							It's the year 2033 - the future. Magnetic levitation trains run worldwide. The criminal group A.S.S.H.A.T. has begun hijacking these trains all over the globe to steal stuff and generally cause a ruckus. It is now up to the Power Assault Leader Squad to put an end to A.S.S.H.A.T.'s shenanigans once and for all. 

Take control of international commandos Sledgevessel & The Hammer and travel the world across 4 locations to deliver swift justice to your enemies. Experience classic arcade run n' gun gameplay with crisp visuals for all the P's your TV can handle.  And most importantly, there's 2-player couch co-op.
