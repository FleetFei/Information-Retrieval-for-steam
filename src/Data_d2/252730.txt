							About This Game
							The original PC sensation that started it all! We've brought it back in all its virginal glory!

The world was a much simpler place in 1995. The kids were listening to the grunge, the first test-tube gorilla was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, and a little trivia game called YOU DONâ€™T KNOW JACK took the interactive CD-ROM trivia game show world by storm. Play now and relive that crazy, mixed-up time all over again!
