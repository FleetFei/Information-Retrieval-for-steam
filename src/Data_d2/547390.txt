							About This Game
							Mosaic: Game of Gods is a game of mosaic puzzles made of different materials. 

The Universe exists balancing between Chaos and Creation. They bring harmony and equilibrium; they are watching the flow of life. But, when one of the forces prevails, the world becomes unrecognizable. And so it happened once, when the furious God of Chaos decided to wipe all the life off the Earth. 

And now only the Goddess of Creation is able to bring everything back and tame the heart of the God of Chaos.
