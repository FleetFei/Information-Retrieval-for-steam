							COMMANDER DLC for Wargame: European Escalation extends the conflict with brand new content.

Wargame’s DLC features "Economy", a new game mode available in both multiplayer and AI matches with new objectives for commanders worldwide. To earn victory in this mode, you will have to reach a certain number of Command Points before your opponents (points obtained by taking control of areas in the field). These points can also be used to deploy reinforcements, and a hard choice will quickly be imposed: continue your march toward victory or batten down the hatches and build your defenses!

In addition to Economy mode, two new maps (Bystrany & Thüringen Wald) are now available for Destruction, Conquest and Economy modes. On these rugged maps, hilly regions provide a serious height advantage, while ambush opportunities will keep players on their toes!

For even more excitement, the new Eye of the Storm map is now playable in Alamo mode, while the maps Two Flanks and Blood River are available for Conquest mode.

New game mode Economy for multiplayer and AI matches
2 new rugged maps for Destruction, Conquest & Economy modes (Bystrany & Thüringen Wald)
