							Along with 542 face graphics from "Warriors: Legends of Troy", "BLADESTORM: NIGHTMARE " and "ROYAL BLOOD II", we have added a new scenario, "208 Sousou Kahoku wo seishi tenka wo nozomuu."
By setting the face graphics using "Officer Edit" in EDIT mode, players will allow those faces to appear in the game on those characters. The scenario uses the face graphics from "RTK 12." In addition, this scenario can be edited.
