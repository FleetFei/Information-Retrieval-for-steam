							The fleet is ready for your orders commander!

Assume control of your fleet to confront your opponent. Pick and place your ships to deploy them on the battlefield. Seek and destroy your opponent's fleet before losing yours.

Clash of Vessels VR brings the well-known strategy game to VR. Your opponent's is out there on the horizon to confront. Seek out your opponent's fleet consisting of 5 ships (Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine and Destroyer).

Clash of Vessels VR introduces realistic VR controls. As you aim and fire, homing missiles will target your opponent. You will see your ships getting hit, catch fire as they take damage and sink when they can no longer fight. You will love the way you can interact with your ships and the battlefield. Make sure you check out the controls to ensure maximum fun.

In the near future, we are planning to improve our game by adding multiplayer option to battle with real life opponents. Any kind of feedback to improve our game is much appreciated.
