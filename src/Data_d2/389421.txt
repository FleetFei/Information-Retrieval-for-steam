							Welcome to Russia, Comrade. Failure is not an option.

Expanding upon the award winning Panzer Corps game system, Soviet Corps puts you in command of the forces of the Stalinâ€™s Russia and expects nothing less than Total Victory!

Can you resist Operation Barbarossa with defensive actions such as at Bialystock-Minsk and Moscow before counter-striking to relieve and encircle Stalingrad and start the reclaiming of Soviet soil? You will also see action in Finland, The Crimea, Romania and Hungary before breaking down the doors of Berlin itself.

Panzer Corps: Soviet Corps is an expansion for existing Panzer Corps owners and a full stand-alone for new players.

Soviet Corps includes more than 25 new scenarios in a branching campaign stretching from Murmansk to The Crimea and from Khalkhin Gol to the banks of the Elbe.

Players will also have access to over 60 new regular and special elite units including the PT-34 variant of the T-34, GAZ-67B jeep recon, G-11 glider and even the IS-3 Heavy Tank!
