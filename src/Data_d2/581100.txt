							Langoth (Old English) means a very specific yearning, when a person had a vision of Paradise â€“ and it was gone, but the rest of his life he was looking for it reflections.The world around you is not real - it's only a high-quality multi-level simulation. Due to a virus attack on the basic simulator system, the program was corrupted and all living entities disappeared from the world and have been replaced with virus cells, eating the remains of the matter. Hope fades by the minute, and the higher beings are planning to reset the simulation, beginning the long process of evolution all over again.  If that happens, the world will never be the same. Simply changing the basic code while it's being run is no longer possible, but fortunately, all is not lost!  You, a being from the outside world, have been sent as a drastic last resort to clear the viruses from inside the simulation. Will you be able to accomplish your mission and restore life on Earth as it was once before?Features:Three large locations (and one secret location)Various secret placesA variety of generated enemiesBombs!Beautiful stylized graphics powered by Unreal Engine 4Arena mode
