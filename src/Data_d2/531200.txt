							"There are bodies buried beneath the cherry trees!"

A Japanese poetic literature "Beneath The Cherry Trees(1928)" by Motojir≈ç Kajii starts from a shocking sentence.
We made a short Visual Novel based on this story with Illustrator Kotori's watercolor works, beautiful photographs, and imposing musics.
