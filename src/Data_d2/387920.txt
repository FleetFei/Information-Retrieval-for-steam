There are a number of additional changes specific to MAX mode:You begin with a fully powered weapon right at the start of the game, but at the cost of increased difficulty and bullet speed.Collecting amber chips increases your counter.  You can generate large amber by shooting enemies at point blank range to increase the counter faster.Bullets are much faster when the counter is over 10,000 or 50,000, but you will get increased points.You begin with only one bomb, but with the MAX mode enabled Reco will defend herself automatically if hit.  MAX mode encourages a very aggressive play style right from the start of the game and presents a different challenge for veteran players to enjoy.
