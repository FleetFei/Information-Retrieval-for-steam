							About This Game
							Itâ€™s the first time developers have taken a risk to combine magical fantasy style and pragmatic steampunk. Players try the role of merciless warriors who destroy enemies using armored wheeled monsters. Each machine is a result of ingenious military engineering. In addition to tens of weapon and armor types all the machines are equipped with exclusive bonus modules.  

  Battles full of adrenaline take place on earth and in the air, under the blinding sun and in bitter frost. Interactive maps and well-detailed physics considering landscapes and peculiarities of all mechanisms supplement rich gameplay.

*For Mac-players : if you have an issue with the game (black screen) - please turn off Steam overlay.
