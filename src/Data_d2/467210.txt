							About This Game
							• If something looks real - it is real! If you don't see a problem - there is no problem at all. Just trust your eyes!

• The regular laws of physics don't apply in Evo Explores. Even the gravity is under control of your imagination.

• Manipulate surreal structures to solve mind blowing puzzles. Every level will unravel the history of Byte planet and its citizens.

• Construct optical illusions to built impossible paths and guide Evo to the finish door.

• Evo Explores was inspired by a gorgeous Monument Valley game. We are big fans of original game, but we love Evo Explores even more! Come share this feeling with us!
