							About This Game
							You are Dehon, the Great Disciple of the Caste of the 40 000 Moons. You have slain and devoured your brothers because they lacked courage in the face of the mysterious Evil that decimated your universe. Bravely fighting him in your fortress temple, you gradually lost your mind, and in a moment of lucidity you took your own life.
Your body and soul drifted through the spirals of time, going back to the origin of everything. When you woke up in the temple of Evil, you felt your hate towards this Evil hadnâ€™t faded. You will have to follow an initiatory course that will lead you to confront this Evil, guided by your father and mentor Gommend. Will you really keep the promise you made to yourself?
