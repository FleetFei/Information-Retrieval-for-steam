							Heroes are forged in times of crisis. The fate of empires can turn on the actions of a single individual.

Heroes are a new type of card for your Trade Deck. When you acquire a Hero, it goes directly into play instead of into your discard pile. Then the Hero awaits your command to rally their allies and give your turn a boost.

This expansion contains 12 cards: 2 Cunning Captain, 1 Admiral Rasmussen, 2 Ram Pilot, 1 Blob Overlord, 2 War Elder, 1 High Priest Lyle, 2 Special Ops Director and 1 CEO Torres.
