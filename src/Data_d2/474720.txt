							Catlateral Damage is a first-person destructive cat simulator where you play as a cat on a rampage, knocking as much stuff onto the ground as possible. See the world through the eyes of an ordinary house cat, now with virtual reality support for the HTC Vive! Use your motion controllers as paws to swat at all your owner’s beloved belongings within procedurally-generated houses. Race the clock in Objective Mode or just chill at your own pace in Litterbox Mode. After experiencing the life of a cat in VR you’ll finally understand why cats are so mischievous: because it’s fun!
