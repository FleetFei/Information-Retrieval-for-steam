							About This Game
							Your world is a world of trees. These trees need to grow and multiply. In this world you represent life, light and color, everything thatâ€™s good and everything that is in danger of imminent destruction. Carefully plan how to use your precious seeds and resources to expand your territory and fight those who would corrupt your world. Prove that you can survive in the world of Nanuleu.

Nanuleu is a RTS/Tower defense game where you control a network of magical trees that need to survive and defeat the enemies that attempt to destroy them. In this game your only task is to plant, but while doing so you need to choose between expansion, resource acquisition and defense. Your objectives are to capture certain points on the map and destroy your enemies, before it is too late.
