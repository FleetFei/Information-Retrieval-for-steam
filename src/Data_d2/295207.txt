							The EWS Class 58 Livery Pack requires the BR Class 58 Loco Add-On to be installed. This pack contains three variants of the EWS Class 58 livery as carried by Class 58 locos under ownership of the English, Welsh & Scottish (EWS) company following privatisation of the BR network in the late 1990s. This pack is an ideal upgrade to the original BR Class 58 add-on for those who wish to run the Class 58 in the post-privatisation era.Liveries included:EW&S EW&S with high stripeEWS
