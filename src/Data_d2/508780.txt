What originally started as a festival to honor the rare Winterflower has grown into an annual gathering for families, soldiers, and hunters to eat, drink, and dance the night away.The festival is named after the rarest flower in the world.

When carefully transplanted near the village the Winterflower is considered a blessing which protects the village from harm.It is customary for the men of the village to ask the women to the dance by presenting them with rare, difficult to obtain gifts.
