							About This Game
							Turret Architect is an incremental game where you get to build your own gold-farms.There is always something to do, build new tiles, upgrade the old ones, collect gold, expand your map, find the sky islands.Kill Mobs to get gold, use Turrets to automate that.Then use Spawners to spawn more mobs in selected locations, filling them up with life essence collected from Life Plants.Automatically pick up gold with Gold Collector's, and speed up time in selected areas with Overloaders.Expand your map, finding the sky islands with goodies that include useful Player Abilities.Upgrade the Turrets, increasing your damage, upgrade Spawners to fight tougher mobs that drop more gold, upgrade the Life Plants to feed the increasing needs of spawners, continue the cycle.This game is still very much under development, and we are planning to add many more features like: New buildings, Multiplayer, Reset mechanics and Bosses.
