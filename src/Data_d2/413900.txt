							About This Video
							This video tutorial mainly talks about how to handle MATTE and METAL materials using some simple tricks and tips I use on a daily basis. This is for those who are more intermediate and have control of their paintings, but not their materials. You should refer to the Painting with Confidence video (Coming Soon to Steam) if you are a super beginner, before this video.Topics CoveredCapturing the shapePicking a light sourceAdding SpecIncludedTool PresetsHi-RES PSD, JPEG Files
