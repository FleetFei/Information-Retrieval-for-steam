Get yourself a little summer day with a raspberry jam adventure!Our hero was spending summer happily at the cottage until curiosity forced him to try unknown berry at the stream. Before he knew it, everything became incredibly huge, and he was reduced to the size of a bug!Trying to understand what happened to us and how to return everything back to normal, we set off into the invisible for human eye tiny world, where the worms, beetles and spiders live their life, build bizarre vehicles, disguising them so that people can guess nothing.Our new friends will surely help us by discovering the secret of healing potion, which will bring us back to the previous size. All we need - to collect enough raspberry for cooking the jam by grandmother's recipe. And as we all know - it is a remedy for any trouble!
