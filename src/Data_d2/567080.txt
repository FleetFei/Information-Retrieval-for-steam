							Please note that the game is currently in Early Access. Please familiarize yourself with the current state of development, and make sure it matches your expectations, before making a purchase.Wizards and Warlords is a turn-based strategy game, where you play as a wizard in a randomly generated fantasy world, filled with rival wizards and warlords. Create a customized sovereign or choose from one of many predefined templates. Blending grand strategy with aspects of the 4X genre, the game offers a plethora of settings and randomly generated cultures and races. It is up to you if you want to fight great wars, crushing powerful rivals in the pursuit of world conquest - the challenge of survival in a grim and dangerous world, perhaps even beset by planar invaders and ancient evils - or a balanced game, where you control but one of many realms in the world, immersing yourself in an emergent story driven by random events and the interactions of AI personalities. Manage your cities and fortresses, increase your power through research and industry, design arcane constructs, recruit armies and heroes, explore and exploit dungeons and ruins, and experience random events and event chains. You can mod several aspects of the game and create your own world maps.
