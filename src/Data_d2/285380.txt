							On the Road – the realistic truck simulator for the PC by the developer Toxtronyx is currently in an advanced stage of development. Use the Early Access phase to tell us about your own wishes and ideas, while being able to explore Germany’s roads already – for a discounted price!In the Early Access version, there are already about 1500 km of motorway and more than 300 km of country roads at your disposal – including 12 detailed motorway interchanges. The player can already stop by in 7 cities in North Germany (for now) like Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin, with unique road designs and sights. During the Early Access, 11 more cities will follow, e.g. Cologne, Dortmund, and Munich. Additionally, numerous other points of interest are waiting to be discovered during the journey, as well.The terrain rendition is based on real satellite data. Additionally, different weather conditions and an authentic day/night cycle are already implemented, with seasons following shortly.Thanks to the cooperation with MAN, the truck appears very realistically – including the MAN TipMatic transmission, retarder/Intarder and service modes. Articulated truck trains with different trailers, lift axles, and vehicle styles with consequences for the reputation are planned for the Early Access.On the Road also features a basic economic system, allowing the player to found his own company. In the long term more features are planned to make this system more complex, e.g. purchasing licences and hiring drivers.
