							About This Game
							Destroy the cubes before they constrict to crush you in this 3D and VR capable casual puzzler. Designed with Virtual Reality in mind, but VR is not a requirement. It can be controlled with a Mouse, Gamepad, or using the Vive Motion Controllers. All modes support a 3D match-3 style puzzle experience where the cubes will constrict on you over time. A ping pong style game mode is also supported for those with Motion Controllers.
