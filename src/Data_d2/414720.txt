							About This Game
							Exiled to a deep space mining sector, you are left with a crappy ship, a laser, and a small mining beam. It is up to you to survive by working your way through galaxy. Mine asteroids, refine and trade their ore, buy upgrades for your ship, hunt pirates in the procedural star systems and youâ€™ll have only scratched the surface. This all takes place in a lush 3d environment with full 3d camera control at all times. Akin to eve and homeworld, the intuitive interface provides everything you need, right where you need it.
