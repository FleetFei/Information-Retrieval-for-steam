							Audio Arena: Player versus Music.

Audio Arena is a single player arena game in which the gameplay is generated by music. The arena stretches 360 degrees around you and the enemies get spawned on the beat of the music.
Dodge your enemies using Gaze or Motion controls. Powerups are placed in the arena to kill your foes. Picking them up on the beat of the music increases your sync bonus for higher scores.
At the end of the song you score will be recorded, if you can make it that far.
