							About This Game
							The journey begins with four silent protagonists. They go into dungeons, fight 
enemies, defeat bosses, and level up. But, is that all there is to their lives? 
Meanwhile, in the real world, a group of bored game designers are looking 
to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. Will your protagonists 
simply fight respawning enemies for all of eternity or will they achieve 
greater things? (Intended to be part 1 of a trilogy).

This demo allows you to play the first 2 dungeons.

Features: 
Free-turn Stamina Battle System (Mixture of SMT Nocturne and Chrono Cross). 
Full recovery after every battle.

10 Classes to choose from at start of game. You pick a class for all 4 of your starting characters at the beginning of the game (Like in FF1). High replayability value.
