							About This Video
							IVERSON is the story of one of the most electrifying and polarizing athletes of all-time, told largely in the NBA legendâ€™s own words. Allen Iverson rose from a childhood of crushing poverty in Hampton, Virginia to become an 11-time NBA All-Star and universally recognized icon of his sport. Off the court, his audacious rejection of conservative NBA convention and unapologetic embrace of hip hop culture sent shockwaves throughout the league and influenced an entire generation of basketball fans. The tell-all documentary charts the career highs and personal lows of one of the most distinctive and accomplished figures the sport of basketball has ever seen.
