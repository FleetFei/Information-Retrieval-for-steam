							About This Game
							You limp down a dark tunnel, blood dripping from your hands as you struggle to hold your light. You try to look at your map, try to remember where you are and where you need to go. You hear a sharp cracking sound behind you, the map falls to the floor as you realize the truth, it has won. You feel something behind you, a cold wind blows past...darkness...

This demo is meant to test your courage and push you to your limits as you navigate your way out of this nightmare. The demo can be played multiple times as every time you play, the game changes.
