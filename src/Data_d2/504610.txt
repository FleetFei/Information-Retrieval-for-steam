							Enter a new world.

Take the role of warrior controlling giant SaberSaws to defend yourself from waves of ever more challenging bots. Slice bots that come close with your sword, deflect lasers with your shield. Complete challenges to unlock new game modes. 

SabreSaw uses 2 vive controllers and you can switch the controller between sword and shield at any time by pressing the trigger. Just slice a TV with your sword to start!
