							Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 HD Revert Pack, the downloadable content for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD, expands on game’s winning formula with the inclusion of three levels from the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 (Airport, Los Angeles, and Canada). Skateboarding legends Steve Caballero and Geoff Rowley make their return to the world of Tony Hawk games and James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo from Metallica make a surprise appearance as playable characters. But perhaps most importantly for true fans, the Revert move makes it return for mind-blowing combos!
