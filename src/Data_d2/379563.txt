							Aerosoft’s Diamond DA20-100 Katana 4X is proof of the old saying ’what looks good, flies good’. The Katana is a cutting-edge GA aircraft made out of fibre-reinforced composites. Originally designed to be a training aircraft, it is primarily used by private pilots who enjoy the wonderful flight dynamics and its economical running costs.

The FSX: Steam Edition version of the DA20 gives you the full owner’s experience as you do the maintenance and cleaning, and even decide what type of oil to use. 

The DA20 for FSX: Steam Edition comes with three modes:

Realistic - Wear and damage can be encountered and will be stored. Fluids will be used and the aircraft can get dirty. Maintenance and services are available. Flight hours and landings will be counted and special features unlocked. 

Simple - No wear and damage will be simulated. Aircraft stays clean. Flight hours and landings are not locked. No special features. 

Instructor - Aircraft is as new every reload. Wear and damage can be encountered or be triggered, but will not be stored. Fluids will be used and the aircraft can get dirty. Flight hours and landings will not be counted and no special features are available. Instructor Panels are available.

Additionally, the airframe is fully operational with canopy animations including opening cowling, fuel tank covers and oil access doors, wear and tear, and your aircraft can also get dirty as you fly. 

The level of realism in the Rotax 9125 engine is more than ample. You can even hand start the engine via the prop! The Katana is equipped with state-of-the-art avionics, as well as a fully simulated carburettor and fuel system.

This, combined with both sound and visual effects (every operational switch has its own sound), makes Aerosoft’s Diamond DA20-100 4X a shining addition to your FSX: Steam Edition fleet.
