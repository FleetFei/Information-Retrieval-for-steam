							About This Game
							Dark Future: Blood Red States puts you in command of a team of hired road-mercenaries plying their brutal trade on the ravaged highways of mid America, 2023. The government barely functions as huge corporations hold sway in the cities, while the rest of the land slides into chaos. On the highways of mid America - aka The Big Empty - pollution, stagnation, catastrophic climate change and gang warfare has resulted in a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In this dystopian alternative America, the ‘Sanctioned Ops’ - highway warriors for hire - hold sway, enforcing what few laws remain - but only if you can afford to pay. With violent gangcults hunting on the broken roads, contracts are plentiful, morals are flexible and the ways to die are growing day by day. Run your Sanctioned Ops agency how you see fit; take jobs that help citizens, catch criminals, and clear the roads of murderous scum, or engage in the murky world of corporate sabotage, industrial espionage, and hired hits. Having equipped your team with high-powered vehicles - complete with a devastating array of weapons and defences earned throughout the single player campaign - you issue your commands to your Interceptors in real time, helping them navigate the hazardous roads, attack relentless enemies, and avoid the myriad threats that lie ahead. This real time strategic play, combined with a physics-defying time manipulation mechanic, bleakly beautiful visuals, and a mysterious universe filled with danger, makes Dark Future: Blood Red States a truly unique car combat title occupying a genre all of its own, that we’re calling "RealTimeShift Vehicular Action Strategy".
