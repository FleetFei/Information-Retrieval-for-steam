One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions’ leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace… but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.
