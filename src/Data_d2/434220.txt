							About This Game
							Welcome to the Bear Haven Motel on you new part time electrician job! 

There's temporary er... lack of guests at this time, but this shouldn't worry you. Also we have some strange problems in our electrical system at nights, but we're sure you'll manage to fix them.
Don't forget, if there's something broken by 6:00 am you will be fired!
So don't miss a chance to get a huge payment for your job.
Yes... And about our dear guests. Just try not to get in their way.

Bear Haven is a great indie horror game where you have to survive scary nights.
Please note that it is not yet another "five nights at freddy's" clone. 
You don't have just to watch at cameras as a night security guard, but you can freely walk around and interact with the environment.
Participate in atmospheric and intriguing nightmare adventure.
Fix broken electricity and hide from angry bears so they couldn't catch you.

Run if something goes wrong. Then close the door and turn of the light. The phone shouldn't ring and TV shouldn't work while you are hiding. Then you can survive the first scary night!
