							Choose your space, select drive or reverse and you are done! ... Not really. Choose the difficulty wisely being aware of your skill. Once you did so, try again and again and again until you get it at least a little bit right...Just like in real life, only incredibly frustrating!It is only a matter of time - when will the RAGE start? Do not give in, combine your mouse skills with your arrow reflexes and prove you are not a danger in traffic.
