							Have you ever wanted to be president? or prime-minister? Convinced you could do a better job of running the country? Let's face it, you could hardly do a worse job than our current political leaders.Crime, Unemployment, National Debt, Terrorism, Climate Change...Have you got the answers to the problems that face western industrialized nations? Here is your chance to find out...An entire virtual countryDemocracy 3 simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. A custom-designed neural network is used to model individual voters, each which varying memberships of voting groups, political parties and pressure groups. Each voters income is modeled, along with their levels of complacency and cynicism. This is the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created.Unique user interfaceDespite being vastly detailed under-the-hood, Democracy 3 has a unique user interface that makes visualizing the connections between laws, policies, voters and situations easy. A simple iconic-based view of your countries issues allows you to 'drill-down' through all the relationships between policies and voters to quickly analyze the impacts of your decisions. Your trade policy may affect GDP, which will affect unemployment, which will effect poverty, and thus crime, leading to a change in tourism, which affects GDP...Complex simulated votersEach individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example. Not only this, but the extent to which they identify each of those groups is both variable, and can be affected by your policies in the long term. Convert your country to religion, or atheism, to capitalism, or socialism by careful and nuanced adjustment of your policies and laws over time. A 'focus group' feature lets you look at individual voters and see exactly how they came to a decision to vote for you (or not!).Read the reviews!http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/18/democracy-3-hands-on-losing-elections-with-land-mines-in-a-complex-politics-sim/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/07/greatest-britain-democracy-3-hands-on/http://indiestatik.com/2013/10/09/kill-your-starry-eyed-romanticism-in-real-time-with-democracy-3/http://www.jumptogamer.com/reviews/democracy-3-review/http://www.kernelmag.com/reviews/game-review/6167/democracy-3/http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2013/10/28/democracy-3-review-pc/http://tiger-gaming.org/democracy-3/http://www.bagofgames.com/2013/10/democracy-3-review/http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/pc/Democracy-3-Review-393388.shtmlhttp://www.n4gtv.com/threads/democracy-3-review.592/... and lots more...Mod SupportDemocracy 3 is very configurable and trivial to mod.
