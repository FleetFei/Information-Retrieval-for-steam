The SNCF BB 75000 (also known as the SNCF BB 475000) are 4 axle diesel electric locomotives ordered in 2000 by SNCF for freight operations to renew its aging fleet.
The locomotives are also classified as Prima DE30BAC

They are similar in appearance to the SNCF Class BB 27000, but are in fact the result of a collaboration between Alstom and Siemens. The internal electrical components are similar to those found in the Siemens 'EuroRunner' made for Ã–BB; the Rh 2016, and the bodyshell, bogies and other equipment being of the Prima type made by Alstom.

The initial order was for 400 machines to be delivered from 2007 onwards with an option for a further 100 additional machines. The order is valued at 1 billion euros.

The order for the BB 75000 resulted from a long and arduous project of renewal of diesel freight locomotives, which began in 2000, and spans a period of seven years from the announcement of the tender to the delivery of the new BB 75000s.

SNCF had a requirement for new diesel locomotives for two reasons:
The current diesel fleet is very old and expensive in terms of operation and maintenance.
The changes in European pollution and emission regulations as well as noise regulations make it necessary for the organisation to renew its fleet.
