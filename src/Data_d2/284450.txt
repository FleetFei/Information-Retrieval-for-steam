							Delve into the Lost Crowns Trilogy with the DARK SOULS™ II Season Pass.

By purchasing this Season Pass, you will get at discounted price the three  additional chapters from the Lost Crowns Trilogy and start a journey through underground caverns spanned with stepped pyramids, a massive tower engulfed by black mist or an ancient temple wrung with freezing storms, towering walls and a hollow emptiness.

This quest will lead you through:
-Crown of the Sunken King
-Crown of the Old Iron King
-Crown of the Ivory King

Those 3 chapters will lead you to confront new fearsome bosses and hosts of new enemies through entirely original areas and will respectively be released on July 22nd, August 26th, and September 30th. 

Each DLC will be added to your Steam account as they become available. 
The season pass requires "DARK SOULS™ II" to function.
