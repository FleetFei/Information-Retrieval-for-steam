							Gathering of Power expansion introduces 4 new classes: Warrior Priest, Vampire Lord, Cultist and Golem Master.Other improvements: Visual appearance of the game in fullscreen mode was improved (especially in Windows 7). Campaign was changed. Players now start the campaign with all cards unlocked, and learn upgrades to the cards during the campaign. Upgraded versions of cards are available in the campaign only. Now it is possible to select cards and slots with arrow keys (useful on laptops). Blitz duels were implemented in the online league. Each player has 15 seconds for their turn - these battles are quick as lightning! Good news for players with unreliable internet connections: now it is possible to reconnect after a broken connection and finish the duel.Note: Spectromancer: Gathering of Power is not compatible with saved campaign games and replay files from older versions!
