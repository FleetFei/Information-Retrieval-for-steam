							About This Game
							A rogue-lite river journey through the backwaters of a forgotten post-societal America. Forage, craft, evade predators.

From the Art Director of BioShock and a team of veterans of the BioShock, Halo, Guitar Hero and Rock Band series comes The Flame in the Flood.

Travel by foot and by raft down a procedurally-generated river as you scrounge for resources, craft tools, remedy afflictions, evade the vicious wildlife, and most importantly, stay ahead of  the coming rains.
