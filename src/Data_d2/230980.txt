							About This Game
							Starseed Pilgrim is a game about tending a symphonic garden, exploring space, and embracing fate.


You are a gardener, tending to empty noise and empty space to fill them both with colour.
You are a refugee, building your own world away from the spreading darkness.
You are an explorer, discovering new places, new rules, and new fascinations.


The Universe Is Bigger Than You Know.
