							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Starstorm expansion.Captain McPain was a feared pirate throughout the seven galaxies. The man was well-known for his stature, his ability to carry around a full-sized cannon by himself, and his skill in actually firing the thing. He boarded many shipping vessels, claimed some booty, and distributed it fairly amongst his crew. He was as much a gentlemen as he was a fearsome rogue.But disaster struck when one day he boarded a vessel operated by the Order of Popae Monks. When one of the monks was accidentally sucked out of the airlock, The Grand Space Butterfly took offense and cursed the pirate and his crew. On that day, Captain McPain became a ghost that would forever haunt the shipping lanes throughout the Galaxy. A haunting visage that strikes fear into those that travel the void!This DLC contains a custom skin for Ted McPain in Awesomenauts: Starstorm. The Scourge Captain McPain skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for his abilities.
