							Vision Runner is a First Person Parkour game currently in development with Unreal Engine 4.The concept of Vision Runner is the Build, Share & Play principle. You got the opportunity to make your own maps/parkour’s with the In-Game map editor and then sharing them by uploading it automatically after the press of a button to our servers. Then all players can download and play the map in a race against the clock from the map browser or as we call it “Parkour Central”.The Editor is easy to use, since we’ve made it completely grid-based. Players can simply place Blocks or Objects on the floor or other blocks.Early Access FeaturesIn-Game map editor with basic features and map sharingParkour Central (map browser)Playing maps from other players against the time.Basic parkour movement: climbing, sliding, wall running, jump overPlanned FeaturesMultiplayerMore Game Modes like Trick RunningVarious Textures for ObjectsMore Content for the EditorMore TricksVarious CharactersWeatherMap LocationsMini-Story Creator**Low Priority
