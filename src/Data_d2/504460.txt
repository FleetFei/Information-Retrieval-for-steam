							About This Game
							Team Racing LeagueTeam Racing League is the first team-based racing game where you win and lose together as a team. Compete in an online 3v3 race where skill and collaboration are key to victory. Team up, strategize and use tactics to disrupt and beat the opposing team in a MOBA-like clash! In Team Racing League, there are lots of skill-based mechanics. You can race, crash, boost, drift, block, jump and brake your way to success. Choose to fight for position, play a support role or turn around to troll your opponents. Not everyone on the team needs to race, the others can support the racer by blocking opponents or by connecting your hovercraft with someone from your team. Once connected, you can create speed boosts or extend into a roadblock, making life harder for the opposing team.Team Racing League was inspired by retro arcade racing games like Super Off Road, Micro Machines and Championship Sprint. Instead of relying on power-ups, Team Racing League is all about teamwork and racing skills. It aims to be a pure racer, without artificial equalizing mechanics. During the game the complete track and all racers are visible in a top-down view. The mid-poly atmosphere is enhanced by an 80's style synthesizer soundtrack and palpable sound effects.Features:Team-based 3v3 racingWin together, lose togetherSupport your teammates and block your opponentsUnique connecting mechanicsSkill-based racingNo power-ups or weaponsPractice against your own ghost
