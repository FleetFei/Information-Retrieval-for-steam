							An essential member of Cessna’s 205, 206, and 207 series of single-engine GA aircraft, the Stationair is used commercially in addition for personal flying. With a spacious cabin and rugged build, the CU206 when fitted out in different guises is used to carry out such tasks as observation and photography, sports and leisure activities and providing lifelines to remote areas. More than 8,000 of all variants were built up to 2006. The ‘U’ variants included in this add-on were designated ‘U’ for ‘Utility’ and feature a pair of clamshell doors at the starboard rear to allow loading of larger cargo.
