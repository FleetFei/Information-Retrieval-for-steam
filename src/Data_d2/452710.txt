							About This Game
							Realities allows you to virtually travel the world by transporting real places 1:1 into Virtual Reality. Realities uses a highly sophisticated photogrammetry workflow to capture real places with all their details - seeing these worlds in Virtual Reality is the closest thing to actually being there. Do you want to travel to a cave in France that was used by humans and their ancestors for over 40,000 years? Want to see an 800-years-old German castle or an abandoned, off-limits hospital complex that was used by the Nazis and the Soviets during WWII? With Realities you can pick a spot on the globe and travel there by the push of a button.Exploring is possible with the HTC Vive & the Oculus Rift
