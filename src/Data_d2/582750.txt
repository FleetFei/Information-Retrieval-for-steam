Zeus explodes with anger and hurls a thunderbolt at Hercules who plummets into the sea and is rescued by a freighter bound for New York. There he is befriended by Pretzy who whisks him away from a brawling free-for-all with his shipmates. The plot thickens as Zeus' jealous wife Juno sends the dreaded Nemesis to take away Hercules' God-like strength. Some local hoodlums have just bet a small fortune on Hercules in a weight-lifting competition, and when he fails to win, a chase all over New York is on!
