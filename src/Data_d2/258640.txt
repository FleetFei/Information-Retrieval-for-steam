							The modern, dual-voltage Class 319 EMU is here for Train Simulator in the familiar First Capital Connect livery as seen on Thameslink services out of London.Typical of EMUs built in the 1980s, the Class 319 was built by BREL York between 1987 and 1990 for north-south cross-London services from Bedford to Brighton, entering revenue-generating service in 1988. The four-car units were able to run on both overhead electrification – on lines north of Farringdon - and third rail pick-up, for lines south of Farringdon.Two sub-classes were originally built and over the years, the 86 trainsets have been refurbished, creating five sub-classes in total, of which four still exist. Following privatisation of British Rail, the fleet was divided between two operators, Thameslink and Connex South Central; in 2006, First Capital Connect took over the Thameslink franchise and now operates Class 319 units on Bedford to Brighton services.The Class 319 EMU for Train Simulator is available in First Capital Connect livery and includes a full four-car unit, comprising DTSO, MSO and TSO vehicles. Features of the model include passenger view, fully detailed cab interior, cab lighting, working cab fan, opening cab windows, two-tone horn, cab window blind, day/night running light selection, window reflections in passenger compartments, and driver vigilance device (which can be enabled and disabled).The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the First Capital Connect Class 319 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the London-Brighton route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).ScenariosFour scenarios for the London-Brighton route:	Training: Class 319 Simple Controls	Training: Class 319 Expert Controls	City Flyer	Coast FlyerMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
