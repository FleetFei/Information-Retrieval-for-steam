							The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR) is a fondly remembered name in the minds of steam fans everywhere, and now you can drive along this wonderful railway line from the golden age of steam in Train Simulator. The S&DJR was formed in 1862 during the great era of railway building in Britain, and was a challenge from the beginning as it required building the line over the Mendip Hills, resulting in some tricky gradients. The line carried local freight and passenger traffic, and was particularly busy in the summertime as it carried families from northern England down to the seaside resorts in the south. The line became part of the British Railways Southern Region in 1948, and remained busy throughout the 1950s and 1960s despite more and more cuts being made, culminating in the final closure of the line in 1966. The Somerset and Dorset line for Train Simulator runs from Bath Green Park to Templecombe and includes the classic 7F and Black 5 steam locomotives with rolling stock, as well as scenarios to put you to the test on this wonderful line.Key FeaturesSomerset & Dorset Joint Railway line from Bath Green Park to Templecombe, including Evercreech Junction 7F steam locomotive in British Railways and S&DJR liveriesBlack 5 steam locomotive in British Railways livery, including weathered versionScenarios10 scenarios:A Day of Two HalvesBruised and BatteredDelivery DayMeat MarketRunning on EmptySwift and DelightfulThe Pea-SouperThe Pigeon SpecialGoods to MarketLast OrdersPlease note: if you have already purchased RailWorks or Train Simulator 2012, you already have this route and its contents.
