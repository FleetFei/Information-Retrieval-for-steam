							Hidden away in the serene Scottish countryside above Loch Ness, sits Devil's Ridge Manor. But the tranquility of the estate is an illusion- spooky ghosts and supernatural phenomena have invaded this once peaceful home. At the request of the famous physicist and owner of the manor Allister MacFarley, private investigator Alan P. Cameron leaves his Chicago office for the mists of his ancestral land. But when Cameron arrives, the old physicist is nowhere to be found...

In this thrilling point-and-click adventure game, you’ll confront strange phenomena while exploring the dark corners of the Medieval castle, the old scientist’s secret laboratory and finally the troubled waters of Loch Ness. 

Can you help Cameron discover the mysteries surrounding the lake of Loch Ness?
