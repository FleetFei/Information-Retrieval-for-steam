							About This Game
							BOTOLO is a beautiful, new multiplayer game from The Floor is Jelly creator Ian Snyder. BOTOLO is a fast paced mindreading competition, a dance inside the negative space between your opponent's thoughts. Mind-wrestle your opponents into submission inside hypnotic fields of pattern and color. Steal the ball and protect it from your opponent in this hybrid game of keepaway and king-of-the-hill. 

No friends? No problem. BOTOLO has built-in, state-of-the-art friend simulations! Granted, these incredible programs might not appreciate the simple beauty of a sunset, or lend you a reassuring hug in a time of need, but they DO adapt to your playstyle mid-match, which is almost as good.
