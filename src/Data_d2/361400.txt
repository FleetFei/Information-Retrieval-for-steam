							About This Game
							How well do you remember the 5th grade? Was it as easy as you think it was?  And most importantly, do you recall anything you learned? Comedian Jeff Foxworthy gathers a group of intelligent, full-grown men and women to test their knowledge against children.  Watch in awe as these people try to prove that they are, in fact, smarter than a 5th grader.
