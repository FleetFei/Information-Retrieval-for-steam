							CONSORTIUM Original Orchestral Score by Jeremy SouleMusic.The language of emotion and imagination.It is one of the cornerstones of storytelling, from the bards of old, to the symphony orchestras behind major motion pictures of today. We recognize this, and we recognize the role that music will play in interactive storytelling as the medium grows from its current state of infancy.In most games, music is an afterthought. Something which is created and produced, often separately from the game production. With such evocative titles as “Battle music,” “Exploration music,” etc., it is often placed into the game piecemeal wherever it happens to "sound good".Jeremy Soule has always approached his games with a keen eye, and a steady determination to advance the role that music plays. His scores are spellbinding, embodying the spirit of whatever work he is contributing to, and his standards are impeccable.We approached the score for CONSORTIUM in much the same way one would a film. The non-linear and branching nature of the game means that players will experience the story in their own way, from their perspective.  Jeremy’s music will always be there, complimenting what you’re doing, playing with your emotions. There are musical foreshadowing and powerful thematic moments that will help you to interpret the events and unravel the mystery. This music has deep meaning within the context of the narrative itself, in precisely the same way that the dialogue contributes to the narrative.TRACK LISTING:01:  projectb6 - 00:1502:  Our Little Blue Planet - 05:1803:  The Utopian Dream - 02:4704:  Interdimensional Rift - 00:4305:  The First Glimpse - 00:3906:  Imagine a Future... - 01:0707:  iDGi-1 Control - 01:3208:  Hello Seeker - 01:4009:  Consortium Bishop Six - 01:2610:  The Consortium - 02:0911:  Training Complete - 00:3612:  A Shocking Discovery - 00:5913:  A Dark Deed Explained - 00:3614:  Impossible Surprise Attack - 00:3415:  E.M.P.

Or in other words, it is a hint book to the extremely detailed and rich back story and lore behind the entire concept which makes CONSORTIUM unique. Or in other-other words, it makes for an excellent alternative to playing the extremely complicated (and sometimes tedious!) A.R.G. Essentially, if you play through CONSORTIUM and find yourself wanting more story, more lore, more world and character building, look no further than this document package. The whole package was written by Vidal Desertch, principal inventor of the iDGi-1 satellite, and takes an unbiased look at the early stages of the long-standing conflict between the Consortium King and the Guardian Church. These events are during the King’s early development, back in 2028, whereas the events of  CONSORTIUM are 14 years later.The core 140 page iDGi-1 Discoveries document is split into two sections; Part One covers the high level history and overlaying background information on the King, the Guardian Church, and everything else A.R.G. related. A good starting point. Part Two is the direct guide to the A.R.G. itself with walkthroughs for all the puzzles, screenshots, links to videos, and fully detailed information on every story development. Included in the package is every important image, video, or sound clip linked to from the core document and the A.R.G. itself.
