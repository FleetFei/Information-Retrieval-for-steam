							The U.S. Army is the most powerful ground force in the entire world. The backbone of a ground invasion is the U.S. Army Infantry, and in the midst of combat, their skills, courage, and teamwork are put to the test.					While readiness continues to be the U.S. Army's top priority, how it goes about its business is changing.
