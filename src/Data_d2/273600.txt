							About This Game
							The ruthless Shivans emerged through subspace near Earth, harboring technology light years ahead of anything seen before. They made no attempt to communicate. They did not respond to your heralds. They simply attacked and destroyed everything in their path.

As a pilot for the Galactic Terran Alliance you are no stranger to war. However when racing through space to engage your new enemy for the first time, you sense something different. Suddenly darkness blankets your spacecraft. Your stomach sinks as your eyes pan across the Shivan flagship's massive body. Then it begins. Swarms of fighters pour out of the belly of the flagship and scream towards you. Youâ€™re about to discover everything you know about space combat, dogfight style - just changed.
