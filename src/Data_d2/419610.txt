							In this tutorial, we'll create a Biomech bust in ZBrush starting from a sphere. We'll use features like Dynamesh, Curve Brush and IMM Brushes. I'll show you every step of the process from designing in 3D, blocking out forms to adding realistic micro-detail. Learn how to use Keyshot to light, shade and render your Biomech bust. Then using Photoshop, we'll composite our renders and add finishing touches to create the final render. This is a live video demonstration covering every step of the process.Basic knowledge of Zbrush required.
