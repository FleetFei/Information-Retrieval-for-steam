							Stand strong young crustaceans, for no matter how strong the tide moves, we shall always stand tall! With ebb and flow of battle, a different thread of sound drives you forwards. 

Our battle cry runs deep an the sonar runs through the ocean. Grab your earphones, your lasers and get ready for your adventure down under.
