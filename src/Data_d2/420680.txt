							In A NutshellThe FaceRig Live2D Module brings the amazing Live2D Cubism technology to FaceRig, enabling hand-drawn avatars that move and behave as if they were 3D while keeping all the aspects that make hand-drawn 2D avatars special. Use the provided brand-new 2D avatars (seven new ones!) or create your very own  (by using the Live2D Cubism Editor) and import them in FaceRig! Read on to find out more details!What is Live2D?Live2D is an amazing external technology developed by very talented and passionate people from Tokyo, Japan. It allows for 2D artwork to be animated as if it were 3D.With the optional FaceRig Live2D Module, Live2D models can be imported in FaceRig as avatars.If you are an artist you'll be happy to know that the Live2D Cubism Editor for creating new Live2D models is available for FREE for individuals or small business entities (as defined by Live2D in their EULA), for both leisure and  commercial uses! For legal details (especially if you are a business) please read the Live2D Cubism Editor EULA.How do I create Live2D avatars for FaceRig?You simply create a regular Live2D model by using the Cubism Editor and tutorials provided by Live2D, and then you tweak it using the FaceRig documentation and import it in FaceRig as a user-made Live2D Avatar. You can even upload them to the FaceRig Steam Workshop!Check out the Steam FaceRig Live2D Community Creation Forum for more details, links and technical info http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/8/ .Commercial use of FaceRig content that features Live2D avatarsYou only need to read this paragraph if you want to use FaceRig and Live2D for monetary gain. Monetizing strictly the Live2D model files (which are created by you and saved by using the Live2D Cubism Editor) is in no way regulated or limited by us, Holotech Studios (the makers of FaceRig). The only rules you have to obey are those stated by Live2D Inc. on the Live2D sample website  and in their EULAs. Those rules also apply to the provided Live2D avatar samples (bundled with FaceRig Live2D Module), and to new content that you create using the Live2D Cubism Editor. Monetizing the FaceRig video output that features Live2D content (video files, video streams/feeds, screenshots etc) is subject to both sets of rules and EULA's, (both FaceRig AND Live2D). The FaceRig commercial use limitations are listed in the FaceRig EULA,  http://store.steampowered.com//eula/274920_eula_1 but you can also find them summarized in non-legalese on the FaceRig Pro DLC description page. Feel free to also ask for clarifications via email to info[at]facerig[dot]com. The Live2D commercial use limitations are listed on the avatar sample page and in the Cubism Editor EULA that you must agree to when installing the Cubism Editor. It is worth noting that for individuals, Live2D permits use of the free version of the editor and samples even for full commercial purposes.Please note that licensing FaceRig Pro or FaceRig Studio DLC's does not include in any way the Live2D Cubism Editor Pro (or anything else from Live2D). If you are a medium or large company that wants to use the Live2D FaceRig Module for profit, you will have to license the commercial versions of both Live2D and FaceRig separately.That's about it. We hope to see many amazing creations :D.
