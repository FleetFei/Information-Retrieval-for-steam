							About This Game
							The Wizard has vanished, and only you can find him in this spellbinding hidden-object adventure! The clues to the Wizard's whereabouts are in his workbook, but all the pages are blank. You'll need his magic pen to uncover and guess the image on each page. The better your guesses, the better your score â€” and every image you uncover brings you closer to finding the Wizard. Plus, you can play mystical mini-games, unlock special challenges, score bonus points and earn potent potions. It's a unique new twist on the seek-and-find genre that you've gotta try!
