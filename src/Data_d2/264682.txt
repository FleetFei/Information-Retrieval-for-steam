Touched by the palm of chaos, Possessed Bears charge into battle without fear. Ghosts feast on the souls of fallen enemies, restoring their losses. Inventors and Eyebeasts attack from a distance, while Demonologists, endowed with almost infinite magical power, sow true chaos on the battlefield. Buy the kit and command chaos itself!
