							Add three limited-run custom machines to your garage with the Modified Car Pack – the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster, Ariel Atom 3 Mugen, and the all-new Ruf CTR3 SMS-R…
• With only five chassis ever built, the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster is an open-top hypercar with a monstrous top speed, racecar levels of downforce, and extravagant beauty to match its multi-million dollar price tag.
• Created in celebration of the ten year anniversary of the original ground-breaking track racer, the Ariel Atom 3 takes just 2.9 seconds to go from 0-60.
• Further blurring the lines between reality and gaming, the Ruf CTR3 SMS-R is the result of a collaboration between veteran developers Slightly Mad Studios and Ruf to make a race-spec version of the already-impressive CTR3 super sports car.
