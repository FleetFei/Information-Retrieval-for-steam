							Thank You Bronze DLC contains two items in Skeet: VR Target Shooting. Included is a trophy beside the gun table, and an icon on the new leaderboards! The trophy in this DLC is bronze, and if you also purchase any of the other Thank You DLC you will be able to swap between the different trophies. The leaderboard icon included in this DLC is an image of the clay pigeon target.

Most of the Skeet 2.0 update is free for all players. However, we've seen interest from our fans in supporting Flatbox Studios, which we truly appreciate. This update is our way of thanking the fans of Skeet for their interest and warm reception to the game. if you're interested in thanking us back, please do consider purchasing the Thank You DLC in Bronze, Silver or Gold!
