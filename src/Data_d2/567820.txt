							Call of Cthulhu - Mythos MagicA Library Module for use with the Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletopAn Optional Magic System for Call of CthulhuFor decades magic has been a backbone and prominent feature of Call of Cthulhu. Whether it is a race to stop the summoning of some god or alien, the need to communicate with things on other worlds by means of arcane scripture, or solving murders done with hexes rather than guns, magic has been inevitably wedded to the game narrative.Here is, hopefully, a useful breakdown of what magic is, what it can do, how it works and how Investigators can make it work for them. Of course, humans are not the only ones who can use this mysterious force and Mythos specific magic is also examined.MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ASSOCIATION monographs are longer works by one or more authors on a subject of import to Call of Cthulhu roleplayers. On these products the author has also fulfilled the functions of editor and layout artist; we at Chaosium have done little in the way of editorial. We found these works compelling and thought that you would enjoy them. Through the publication of monographs we can offer our most loyal fans more information more easily, and evaluate the potential of these works for eventual release to the wholesale market.Conversion by: Alan NeilsonCALL OF CTHULHUHorror Roleplaying in the Worlds of H.P.
