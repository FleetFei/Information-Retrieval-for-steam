							The Sea of Stars Soundtrack includes two contrasting medleys by the two musicians who contributed to the game's score. The main feature, "Sea of Stars Suite" by Edwin Sykes is composed of the fully-orchestrated theme, traveling and combat music. The second track, "Alien Space" by Rich Carlson is a journey through the many musical and ambient soundscapes you hear when encounters, discoveries and other events occur in the game.

Edwin Sykes is an award-winning composer who has written a huge variety of music for film, concert and dance including feature films such as Tuesday, Resurrecting the Streetwalker and The Hit Producer. He has composed music for all episodes of the radio show The Scarifyers (staring the late Nicholas Courtney, David Warner and Terry Molloy) for BBC radio 7. His concert music has been performed by members of the London Symphony Orchestra, Spiral Saxophone Quartet, The Ebony Quartet, The Paddington Brass Quintet and The Ariel Ensemble in San Francisco.
