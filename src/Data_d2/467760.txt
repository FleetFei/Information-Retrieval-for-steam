While you laugh at your friendâ€™s misfortune, you notice a strange tingling sensation all over your body. This is the feeling of Trapper's Delight, the emotion you experience when you witness the glory of your opposition falling for your own cunningly elaborate trap.Trapper's Delight is a competitive multiplayer party game where players create a gauntlet of lethal contraptions and secret traps.
