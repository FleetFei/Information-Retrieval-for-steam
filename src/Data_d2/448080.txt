Just type in your lies to questions like: “The mayor of Rabbit Hash, Kentucky is a _____.” Baby? Rabbit? Ham sandwich? It’s up to you! Fool your opponents into thinking your lie is true and you’ll rack up the points! But be careful, if you pick an opponent’s lie, they’ll be doing a Fibbage fancy dance.
