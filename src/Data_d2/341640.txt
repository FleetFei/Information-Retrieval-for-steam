							About This Game
							Relativity Wars is a god-type strategy/action game, set in a universe which obeys Einstein’s theories of relativity!

DON'T PANIC

While Relativity Wars uses some pretty crazy physics concepts you really don't need to understand them to play this game. Hopefully some physics will rub off as you are playing the game and you will suddenly start impressing* your friends in the pub** with phrases like "space/time continuum" and "time dilation".

* Please Note: Actual level of impressed may vary. Relativity Wars is not responsible for any lack of impression that may occur.

** bar, coffee shop, watering hole, street corner, etc, etc.

Start your campaign today, you'll be conquering the universe before you know it, and you might even learn a bit of science! 

Note: Internet required to start only the first ever game session, after this the game can be played offline.
