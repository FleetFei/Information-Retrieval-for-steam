							In the unknown expanse of the deep sea, survival of the fittest is taken to a whole new level. The weak and slow perish while the strong survive. To withstand the unforgiving nature of the depths, its denizens must adapt. For many, the only survival option is to evolve into an exotic and dangerous being. In Qualia 3, you take form of an evolving creature - a "Multi Agent", comprised of three base creature elements. To become stronger and to overcome your adversaries, you will need to adapt and gain access to new forms. The only way to do this is to kill other creatures, collect their energy, and obtain trophies that unlock new forms. If successful, you will gain dominion over the deep sea and become its apex predator! Should you fail, your fate will be sealed as just another forgettable part of the food chain.
