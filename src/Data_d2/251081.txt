							So we asked the guys at Team Meat if they would be cool with us making a Dr. Fetus skin for Admiral Swiggins. They told us "awesome. do as you wish with it :)", so here's what would have happened if Swiggins went to Med School instead of War School. He still ends up as an Admiral in the Navy, somehow - but now with an extra degree and a violent hatred against jumping pieces of bloody meat.

This DLC contains a custom skin for Admiral Swiggins in Awesomenauts, and will automatically unlock the character if you have not already done so.
