							About This Game
							Four Sided Fantasy is a game about pushing the limits of the screen. In this world, you can wrap the screen at any time, so that you emerge from the left when exiting right, and falling down a pit turns into falling from the ceiling. Discover a strange world where a man and woman journey through four seasons in a year, constantly separated by the boundaries of the screen.

Each new season in the game brings a new twist to screen wrap. Just as you think youâ€™ve mastered a screen wrap mechanic, the world will change its rules and present a new way for you to look at the confines of your screen.

Four Sided Fantasy is a concise puzzle gaming experience that respects your time; an experience that lasts around the same time as Portal.
