							NOTE: You do NOT need a heart rate sensor to play Nevermind. With or without a heart rate sensor, emotion-based biofeedback will be available via almost any standard webcam on a min-spec (or higher) Windows or Mac machine*.  Without a webcam or heart rate sensor, the biofeedback-specific features will be unavailable, but the core game itself will be fully playable and enjoyable as an atmospheric mystery-adventure game.Nevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced psychological thriller that takes you into the dark and surreal world within the subconscious minds of psychological trauma patients.As you solve puzzles and explore the twisted labyrinths of the mind, biofeedback technology monitors your feelings of fear, tension, and anxiety with each passing moment. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game becomes harder. If you’re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.Nevermind’s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that can help teach you to be more aware of your unique internal responses to stressful situations.
