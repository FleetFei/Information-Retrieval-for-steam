							About This Game
							The old gods have forgotten this land. No one could save our people when darkness started spreading and collecting human souls for its army. Odallus is a classic exploration/action game, inspired by Ghosts’n Goblins, Demon’s Crest and Castlevania. Player takes place of Haggis, a warrior tired of fight who must wield his sword once more to rescue his son from Darkness.Original Sound Track: http://serenati.bandcamp.com/releasesFeaturesEight levels open to explorationHuge bossesSharp controlsRad 8-bit graphicsThrilling atmosphere8+ hours of gameplay50+ types of enemiesVeteran Mode
