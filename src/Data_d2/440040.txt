							The never-ending war for galactic supremacy has given rise to bold new ships and powerful new bases.

The Bases and Battleships expansion provides you with eight new ships and bases for your Trade Deck. The Machine Cult can bounce bases with the Mega Mech and the Star Empire can lock down your opponentâ€™s hand with a Fighter Base.

This expansion contains 12 cards: 1 Construction Hauler, 2 Defense Bots, 2 Fighter Bases, 1 Imperial Trader, 1 Mega Mech, 1 Obliterator, 2 Trade Rafts and 2 Trade Wheels. Use these cards in online play, versus the AI or a friend, or in the 5th chapter of the campaign.
