							The Rockwell B-1B Lancer™, affectionately known as the "Bone" to its crews, is a key element of the American Strategic Long Range bomber fleet. The aircraft, while not technically stealth-capable, is designed to present only a fraction of the radar profile of earlier large bomber types and incorporates extremely advanced navigation, weapons, and avionics systems. Its swing wing technology, combined with four 30,000-lb thrust turbofan engines, creates a beautiful, fast, and instantly recognisable package. The development of this successor to the B-52™ began in the early 1960's and resulted in a contract being awarded to Rockwell in 1970. The B-1A™ first flew in 1974 but only 3 prototypes were built. 1981 saw an order placed for a fleet of 100 B-1Bs™, the last of which were delivered in the early 1990's.Features:Native FSX model with all FSX features Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls Many custom interior and exterior animations including automatic wing sweep on load-up Opening bomb bays with various era-specific payloads Animated afterburner cans with realistic flame effects Night lighting textures and effects inside and out High-fidelity sounds set from Turbine Sound Studios custom afterburner rumble sound Many simulated cockpit systems, including the VSD Researched and authentic flight dynamics 37-page PDF illustrated user manual in .pdf format**Note – this aircraft does not feature a 2D panel
