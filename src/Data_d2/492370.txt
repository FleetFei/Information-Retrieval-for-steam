							About This Game
							Plunge into court politics and change the course of history, or pursue a love affair that rocks the kingdom to its foundations!

"Affairs of the Court" is an epic interactive fantasy novel by Heather Albano and Adam Strong-Morse. It's a tale of romance, deception and court intrigue, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--223,000 words, without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

Will you play as male or female? Gay, straight, or bi? Match wits with the schemers of the court, or play your suitors off each other? Will you find true love? Gain a crown? Lose your head?
