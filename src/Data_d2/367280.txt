							Miniature Gods is the fourth DLC available for 'Fortune's Tavern: The Fantasy Tavern Simulator!' 

In 'Miniature Gods' you get the chance to make new, unique allies in the form of spirits, demi-gods, and demons who will fight beside you as you quest in the Enchanted Forest or help you carry out raids on rival taverns. Each Mini-God will require something different from you in order to join you, whether it be in the form of an expensive gift or for you to have aligned yourself with a major deity, and once joined they will fight beside you as loyally as any pet.

Features: 

   * Nine Small-Gods that will join your team: from Sam the Spirit-Turtle to an evil Djinn.
   * New Forest areas with shrines to summon the gods.
   * New High-Level enemies.
   * New items.
