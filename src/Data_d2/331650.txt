Nothing wrong with that.Anyway, here's what the blurb on the back of the DVD case had to say about Carmageddon: TDR 2000:The world's most controversial racing game returns with incredible graphics, fantastic game play and even more outrageous fun!Max Damage, imprisoned for life, plots his escape. However, there's the small matter of an army of police, hordes of gangsters and thousands of enraged inhabitants - all with homicide on their minds.
