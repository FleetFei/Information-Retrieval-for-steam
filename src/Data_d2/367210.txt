							Contains the 'Art of BADLAND', digital art booklet (20 pages, PDF) and an ambient BADLAND Medley soundtrack.

Written by BADLAND's lead artist, Juhana Myllys, the booklet contains almost all of the artwork created for the game. There are also some original sketches and concept paintings and even some scrapped ideas. It gives a glimpse of all the building blocks of the final product. The booklet starts with a brief intro in English to the background and the influences behind the BADLAND art style and continues with sketches, handpainted assets, marketing assets and shows the evolution of producing some of the final quality assets. 

Made by BADLAND's audio lead, Joonas Turner, The BADLAND Medley is a 11min 20s long atmospheric sound journey through the world and the moods of BADLAND.
