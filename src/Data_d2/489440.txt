							About This Game
							Looking out on Pleasantville one afternoon, Lord Cthulhu realized he was very lonely. He decides to send a single Tentacute to go make new friends with these "Bonies." After enough friends have been made, the portal to R'lyeh opens &each friend will be sacrificed. In a style that is a cross between "Hotline Miami" and "Pikmin", convert your friends into fellow cute cephalopods! The problem? All of your newly converted friends are frickin' morons that mimic your every move! Luckily with strategic planning you can manipulate them against the environment to get back to the portal home to keep Lord Cthulhu company.
