							About This Game
							Chunks is a block-based sandbox game built for virtual reality.

Build cities and monuments while you're the size of a giant, then shrink yourself to walk inside your creations. Weave elaborate and hair-raising rideable roller-coasters around your world, or tear it apart with a bomb cannon. Share your constructions on the Workshop and download custom tools and game modes for endless fun in an infinite world.

You must own a HTC Vive to play this game.
