							Europe, 1938: The lost Ark was just a warm-up! Now Adolf Hitler is after the most powerful talisman of all - the Holy Grail. A few brave men stand in his way. Fortunately, one of them is Indiana Jones, and this time he has his dad with him.			The bad guys are in your face all the way – mercenaries, traitors and spies. Not to mention everything the Luftwaffe can throw at you.... Can you handle the heat?			If you can, you just might earn a higher I.Q. (Indy Quotient) than the man with the whip and the hat.			Visit dozens of locations you never saw in the movie!			No typing to slow you down…. Just point 'n'click!			Outstanding high resolution 3d graphics.			Over 100 sound effects…. Plus movie theme music.
