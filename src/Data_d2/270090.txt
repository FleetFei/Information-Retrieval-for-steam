							About This Game
							So nauseous pines,
This noxious abyss,
I feed from the milk,
of ultra violet,
Yet I'm lost with you,
My floating twin,
You're the anchor to the drain,
but I am the key, 
To nothing.


Speedrun your Police super bike right into the white hot heart off the skirmish to save the souls of the cities junkies!

Developed by UK based micro-indie team Rail Slave Games, N.P.P.D. RUSH: THE MILK OF ULTRA VIOLET is an intense, vehicular, open world, arena shooter combined with lite RPG elements and a 80s British bedroom programmer feel. There is also an exclusive track written by British electro artist MANPANICS plus classic tracks written by Dylan Barry, Founder of Rail Slave Games.

“Rail Slave Games are to today’s indie dev scene as punk rock was to the music scene back in the late 1970’s” commented Darryl Still, CEO Kiss Ltd.  “I can guarantee you that you will not play anything else like this - it is about as original as it gets”.
