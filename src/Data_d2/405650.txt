Surviving brings you to the next challenge, but don’t take it lightly: if you die, EYE will send you back to the previous level(s)!Why “Black Eye Edition”?

Do you have what it takes? Fun Fact: the initial code name of the project was The Reflexx 2. Due to similarities with many other published games the team decided to go with the name "Eye Will Survive!" which is a pun title inspired by the song "I will survive" by Gloria Gaynor, which after the soft launch was again renamed into Zero Reflex.
