							About This Game
							Frantic Freighter is a rather simple game with a simple premise: get some cargo from planet A to planet B. However, staying alive & reaching your destination isn't easy!Every time you use your warp drive, an important system will likely break down. Hopefully, you'll have a part to fix it! Friendly planets, stations & ships may have spare parts for you, or information on nearby points of interest. Pirates will try to chase you down for your cargo, so hopefully your cloaking & shields systems are available when needed!Successfully deliver your package to unlock random special challenge modes!* Frantic Freighter is best enjoyed in virtual reality with tracked controllers. However, it can fully be played without a virtual reality headset. There is no game menu & the game will immediately start (and restart as needed), with or without VR equipment. Press the Escape key to quit.Trailer Music: Dire Space Emergency by Shane Ivers
