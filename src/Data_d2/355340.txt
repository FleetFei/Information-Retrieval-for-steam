							The six-seat, high performance, PA-32R is one of Piperâ€™s most popular single engine aircraft, brought to FSX: Steam Edition by well-known developer Carenado.

The design began life as the Piper Lance, a retractable gear version of the Piper Cherokee Six; later models are known as Saratogas. A number of PA-32R variants were built between 1975 and 2009, including the PA-32R-301, built in the early 1980s and reverting to a standard tail design. Designated as the Satatoga SP, the aircraft has a maximum speed of 190mph (306 km/h) and a cruise speed of 160mph (258 km/h).

The Piper PA-32R-301 Saratoga SP includes three paint schemes and one blank scheme, with two-blade and three-blade propeller versions. The model is extensively detailed, including window reflections, 3D pilot figure, real propeller effects and interactive virtual cockpit.

The aircraft has also been modelled with extensive animations, including ailerons, elevators, rudder, flaps, trim tab, rotating wheels, operating doors, animated sun visors and vibrating radio antenna.

High quality digital stereo sounds recorded from the actual aircraft are included, alongside realistic aircraft performance based on real aircraft information and pilot observations.
