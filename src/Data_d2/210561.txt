							Rebellion brings you the ultimate mission for the ultimate sniping game – "Kill Hitler!"

You have the leader of the Nazi war machine in your sights and one clear shot. Do you have the skill and nerve to take that shot?

As the Thousand Year Reich collapses, you have received intelligence that Adolf Hitler is returning to Berlin on board his personal train. Intercept it as it waits at the station. One brief opportunity to do what so many wish had been done – Kill Hitler!

The Sniper Elite V2 DLC also includes two extra authentic sniping weapons – the Soviet semi-automatic battle rifle SVT-40 and the standard German service rifle Kar 98:

With its big clip and semi-automatic fire, SVT-40 is the brute of the sniping world. But its lower muzzle velocity leads to more bullet drop over longer ranges, challenging the skills of even the most experienced player.
With the Karabiner you have access to the most powerful zoom in Sniper Elite V2, perfect for long range pinpoint shooting – but only if you can successfully master the ‘Empty Lung’ technique.

One bullet can change history. Purchase the Sniper Elite V2 DLC and take the shot…
