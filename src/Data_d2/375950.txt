							About This Game
							Nurture a small pot of succulents that grow in real time. 

Viridi is a safe haven, a place you can return to for a moment of peace and quiet whenever you need it.

Leave Viridi open in a second window to keep you company while you work, or check in on your plants as a meditative moment every night. While not fully realistic (they're very forgiving), your succulents will require some maintenance and can die from over- or under-watering. Name your favorite plants, give them special care and attention, and they might even flower for you.

Viridi is free to try and comes with your choice of plant assortments. If you think it has a place in your life, you can buy your favorite plants from the in-game nursery for just a few cents a piece. Remember to visit the nursery occasionally for the weekly free seeding!
