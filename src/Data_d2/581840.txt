							About This Game
							All or something is preventing and helping, freezing and melting, braking and slipping, glowing and fading. The devices are subordinated with the common laws of a puzzle. That, that is melted that will not be frozen and will not swim. But there is something unfired that drowning and freezing. The Ice bridges are not for the fire coals. The Steps in the portal come from the place of falling, clamping or a star.
