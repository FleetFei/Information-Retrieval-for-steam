							Toposim Mexico for FSX: Steam Edition provides LOD12 / 10m Multi-LOD terrain mesh for the whole of Mexico, improving the accuracy of the default terrain mesh and offering a marked improvement to the landscape profile. VFR flying over Mexico has never been more realistic with lakes, mountains and ground undulations all where they should be. Please note this pack corrects the default terrain mesh and does not include any textures.
