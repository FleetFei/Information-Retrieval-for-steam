							About This Game
							You may think it's simple enough to run and jump your way through life.  But there's more to this world... or, rather, these worlds. You're entering the duality of a distressed mind, controlling light and dark versions of the same environment.  You hold the key to switching from one to the other.  Every step forward shows a new obstacle, and a new way to alter it between dark and light.  Become comfortable in both worlds and you may be able to make sense of the dreamy landscape around you.  You may even find an explanation for why you're here. Maybe.Key Features2D world-switching actionSurreal pixel-art landscapesImmersive sounds and striking music tracksIntriguing, ambiguous, downright disturbing psychotic atmosphereAn unsettling, humanizing platformerI'm no hero...This is a cold world I've entered — all alone —where only my questions remain to keep me company.

It is your choice to make sense of the answers slowly revealing themselves through time.  The mental landscape you must explore is none too friendly.  You are charged with following my descent into madness.  I can't promise that I can explain what weaves the fabric of this world we've entered.  All I know is that the yarn being spun is shaped by your own beliefs.  I just hope your will is strong, and your faith resolute.
