Every ship contains a highly detailed bridge for you to explore in first person mode.Included is a detailed Mission editor which allows players to adjust wave height, create a selection of triggers and spawn AI ships. This game is a core product for the development team and will continue to be supported post launch with new updates and DLC.Features ListEight ships with highly detailed bridges and Six ports to exploreMission editorWeather conditions include rain, sun and snowRealistic water physics20 missions including some of which can take 40 â€“ 60 minutes to complete
