							Earth Girls Are Easy melds the best of alien-invasion films and musicals to offer great fun. Three aliens (Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans and Jeff Goldblum) crash-land in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. A manicurist (Geena Davis) and her boss (the wacky Julie Brown) befriend the threesome, give them makeovers and show them the town.
