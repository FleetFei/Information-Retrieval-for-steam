The SD70 series of diesel locomotives, launched by the General Motors Electromotive Division in 1992, have become a familiar sight across the length and breadth of the United States, with over 4,000 of the different variants having been produced to date. This add-on includes 3 main variants: the SD70MAC, with AC traction motors, the SD70ACe also with traction motors but developed to comply with new emissions regulations, and the SD70M-2 which is based on the SD70ACe but which has DC traction motors. This add-on depicts the various external detail differences between the models including the ‘Whisper Cab’, and depicts them in realistic prototypical BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National color schemes.
