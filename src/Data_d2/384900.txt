							The Arkona are on the attack. With every move they make they change the world; Devouring history as they go. Only the Brandt Foundation can stop them but not everything is as it seems to be. A darkness has come over Dr.Brandt and the world now seems to dance to his tune. Will you and your friends sacrifice everything to be the last best hope of humanity? 

Temporal Shift tells the story of the Brand Foundation's Defenders of Time taking you through 40 exciting campaign levels. Built upon the idea that its always fun to be doing something in Tower Defense Temporal Shift will ask you to manage dozens or hundreds of towers at once giving you the ability to sell and rebuild anything at any time. The question isn't what can you build and just live with the question is: what combination of towers are you going to need next wave?
