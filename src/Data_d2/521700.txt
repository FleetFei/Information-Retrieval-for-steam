							About This Game
							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. 

In this third round of releases, we offer "Nobunaga's Ambition: Sengoku Gun'yuden," the third release in the series, released in the US as "Nobunaga's Ambition II." 
In this simulation game, players take on the role of a Daimyou of the Warring States period, attract followers, and use strategy and tactics to gain control of the 38 domains of Japan.
