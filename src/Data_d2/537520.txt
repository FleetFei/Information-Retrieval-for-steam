							About This Game
							A research spaceship reaches an abandoned planet. Nothing is what it seems here and the situation quickly slips out of control. Can the crew manage to survive and get back home? SYMMETRY is a time-management survival game set in a postapocalyptic world. Your main goal is to manage the survivors and help them withstand the desolate, extremely cold environment in order to fix the spacecraft and escape. The deep and compelling plot is surrounded by an atmospheric musical score and graphic design that sustains the harsh and mysterious ambience.  Throughout the game you gradually discover a well-developed story and the mystery of the symmetrical world. All characters are members of a research group which crashed on an unknown planet during their expedition. Not only do they need to survive, but also fix their ship and set off back home. Extreme weather conditions and life-threatening supernatural activities make their stay a true fight for survival. Your task is to manage the survivors’ life functions crucial to their existence, such as eating, resting, mental health and individual skills. You also have to fix the ship as quick as possible by gathering all necessary repair parts. You will also be facing difficult moral choices which will affect the entire expedition. Vector graphics give the game a feeling of mystery and severity of the deserted world. Using dimed and pastel colors throughout the scenery creates a sense of remoteness from reality and builds an unreal atmosphere of the landscape. •	Base management in a postapocalyptic world •	Surviving in an unknown world: nutrition, mental health and other attributes of the survivors •	Deep and non-obvious plot •	Mysteries of the symmetrical world •	Difficult moral choices •	Incredible vector graphics and ambient sound setting
