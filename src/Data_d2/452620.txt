							Away at college, Sidney Prescott (Campbell) thought she'd finally put the shocking murders that shattered her life behind herâ€¦ until a copycat killer begins acting out a real-life sequel. Now as history repeats itself, ambitious reporter Gale Weathers (Cox), deputy Dewey (Arquette) and other Scream survivors find themselves trapped in a terrifyingly clever plotline where no one is safe - or beyond suspicion.
