							This explosive, action-packed thrill-ride stars Sylvester Stallone and all The Expendables plus some exciting new recruits. Barney (Stallone) and The Expendables come face-to-face with Stonebanks, one of the original team members who became a ruthless arms dealer that Barney was forced to killâ€¦or so he thought. When Stonebanks returns to destroy The Expendables, the latest mission becomes a clash of old-school style versus high-tech expertise in The Expendables' most personal battle yet.
