							About This Content
							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Overdrive expansion.Even an infamous bounty hunter needs to let off a little steam sometimes and Chucho could do with a little sun. Equipped with two water pistols, a swim ring, and an inflatable plastic mammal, he's ready to just lie in the sand and work on that tan a little. That said... the water pistols look surprisingly similar to his regular pistols with some cool modifications, and you can hear a couple of sticky bombs rattling under his swim ring. Who ever said you can't be ready to collect bounties AND relax on the beach at the same time? This DLC contains a custom skin for Chucho Krokk in Awesomenauts!
