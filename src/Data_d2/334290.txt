Period.No "pay to win": should we ever decide to have microtransactions in the game, it will be for vanity items only, with absolutely no advantage in game: maybe a fancy paint for a ship, or a unique agent portrait, but no more than that.We listen: we made this game so that players can have fun. When it'll be the time to add something new, we'll ask our players first.
