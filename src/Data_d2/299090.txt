							You're the newcomer on the cosplay scene and it's time to make your mark. As you progress you'll get to choose from over 25 costumes inspired by video games, anime, comics and movies. Manage your week's activities between working on your costumes, earning money, deepening friendships and remembering to take a bit of time to relax. Of course nothing comes easy and you'll soon find yourself embroiled in a storyline exploring the dramas of the cosplay scene.

Cosplay Maker is a management and dating simulation game. Inspired by the real world of people who love to make costumes of their favourite characters.
