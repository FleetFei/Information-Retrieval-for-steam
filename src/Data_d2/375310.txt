							About This Game
							WayForward’s award-winning Mighty Switch Force series, transformed into a pick-up-and-play puzzler!

Team up with Officer Patricia Wagon to save Tangent City from a fiery blaze! As a member of Planet Land’s Fire Brigade, your job is to douse the fire in each building — and to evacuate any Hooligan Sisters who may be trapped inside. It’s a dangerous job, but if anyone can save the city, you and Patty can!

Slide blocks around the playfield, and let loose a powerful water spray from Officer Wagon's Infinity Dousing Apparatus (err… hose).  Douse all of the flames, and the stage is clear! Sounds easy, right?

Block types vary from simple slide-puzzle obstacles to full-blown brain-busters like Turnpike Blocks, Mud Blocks, and Cloak Blocks.
Each level has been lovingly crafted and is WayForward Certified, guaranteed to challenge, befuddle, and tickle your fancy.

This version includes:

-50 puzzles spread across 10 Worlds.
-Fully illustrated cutscenes
-Speed Run challenges
-An incredible soundtrack by Jake “Virt” Kaufman
