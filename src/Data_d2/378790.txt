							About This Game
							We are currently planning an English release of Kagura Douchuuki!

Kagura Douchuuki is a roguelike RPG where you control shrine maidens (miko) and battle against monsters. 
Dungeons are randomly generated, so the map layout, enemies, and items will be completely different with each play-through!

Every time your character enters the dungeon, their level will be reset back to level 1*.
You must venture further into the depths of the dungeon to gain more useful and powerful items needed to complete your quest!

Beautiful and charming characters, five different maps, and a final, ultimate dungeon awaits players in the wonderful tale of Kagura Douchuuki!

* In easy mode, the character's level will not be reset.
