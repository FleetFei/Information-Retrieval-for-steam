							About This Video
							Two American college buddies Paxton and Josh backpack through Europe eager to make classically hazy travel memories with new friend Oli, an Icelander they meet along the way. They are eventually lured by a fellow traveler to a particular hostel in an out of the way Slovakian town stocked with Eastern European women as desperate as they are gorgeous. The two friends arrive and easily pair off with two exotic beauties. Initially distracted by the good time they're being shown, the Americans quickly find themselves in an increasingly sinister situation that they'll discover is as wide as the vast web of post-Communist government corruption and as deep as the darkest, sickest recess of human nature itself - if they survive.
