							The Stirling Pack includes an additional Ironcast, ‘The Stirling’; as well as a new Commander.
The Stirling utilises a magnetic limpet cannon to blast an enemy target with electrical energy. Commander Katherine Chapman's signature augmentation has a chance to reward players who match long chains of nodes with additional resources of every type. In addition, she has double the chance to locate rare blueprints on fallen enemies.
