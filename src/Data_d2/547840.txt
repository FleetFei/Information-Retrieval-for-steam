							About This Game
							Alis decides to go on a hike one day, but comes home to find her younger sister brutally murdered! Overcome with grief and vengeance, Alis embarks on a mission to find her sister's killer by following the trail of bodies the murderer leaves behind. She must return the favor of death!
Interfectorem (which means 'killer' in Latin) is a murder mystery visual novel designed by a game dev team (called the "Team Who Must Not Be Named"), comprising of 4 middle school girls who won the annual Grand Prize at Girls Make Games Demo Day. The game went on to raise over $12K on Kickstarter.

Striking a delightful balance between humor and horror (think Nancy Drew meets Shaun of the Dead), Interfectorem will keep your attention from beginning to end!

Will you be able to solve the case and save yourself before it's too late?!
