							Garruk Wildspeaker’s fully unlocked “Apex Predators” green deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Since his spark ignited, evolving him into a Planeswalker, Garruk Wildspeaker has traveled the planes in search of the deadliest prey he can find. Inevitably, he crossed path with fellow Planeswalkers, and Garruk knew the hunt was on. Garruk’s deck is packed with new cards, but his game plan hasn’t changed: cast the largest creatures around, and pump them up to gargantuan dominance.
