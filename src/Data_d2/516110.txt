							Yo!  Check it out... ToeJam and Earl are back on Earth once again, getting funky and running from those crazy Earthlings.  Deja vu! (deja vu!) Here’s the basics… TJ decides it’s a good idea to “borrow” the Rapmaster Rocketship from Lamont (no point waking him up, right?), so he and Big E. can take Latisha and Lewanda out for a joyride. While they’re in orbit around Earth, maybe showing off just a little, TJ tells Earl to crank the bass on the speakers and “Press the RED button!” Unfortunately, that’s the button that says: “Black Hole - Do Not Press!!” (Doh!) You can pretty much guess the rest, TJ and Earl once again find themselves searching for the pieces of their Rocketship, collecting power-up presents left lying around by Santa, and dealing with the less-than-rational human beings.Back in the Groove is a mash-up of the very best features from the classic console games (that's one and two, y'all), with a pile of new features thrown in.  The goal is to give old skool TJ & E fans a pure blast of funky nostalgia, and give new players a taste of the light-hearted, co-op play that is TJ & E.Features:  Nine playable characters including: TJ and E, Latisha, Lewanda, GeekJam, Peabo, and Earl’s mom, Flo.Randomly generated stacked levels, just like game one, but now you can see down! Lots of secret locations (yes level 0 is there too!), and new terrain types.A TON of funky music.  13 remakes of old favorite songs and 13 new songs in the same old skool funky style.A dynamic split-screen for couch co-op play, as well as online play - supports up to 4 players! Randomly generated, improved Hyperfunk Zone allows for multi-player co-op too!A huge number of new presents, Earthlings, player character stats, character-specific dialogue, permanent power-hats, and many features that enhance cooperative play and make this the best Toejam and Earl yet!
