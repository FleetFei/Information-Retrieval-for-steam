							An arms race is taking place in Gemini. The three largest factions are racing to develop true weapons of mass destruction, the massive Titan class vessels. The democratic Korkyra is producing a titan class vessel that is based on the latest shield technology and will feature the strongest shields ever seen in the Gemini universe. Baeldor baronies are united together in an effort to quickly produce a space behemoth that can land a strong punch. The Nyxian consortium used its informants and monetary wealth wisely and is able to quickly join the race by taking what is not theirs: a titan class sized vessel based on Imperial Leviathan designs.Join one of the factions in their worthy attempt and become the deciding factor.
