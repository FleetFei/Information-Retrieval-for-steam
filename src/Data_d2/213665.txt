							This is the Base Defend Pack for Dwarfs!? We know everyone likes a good tower defense style game. Well, this is the Dwarfish take on it. Here, YOU create the maze for the enemies to follow, from up to four enemy spawn points. Well, actually, one of your Dwarfs will create the maze - so you'll want to direct him very carefully each time! Then build towers to destroy the enemy minions as they attack through your maze. And the only limits are your maze and tower-building skills. No time limits. No wave limits. How long can you hold out... ?

And remember - the core game is always FREE! You buy the add-on packs once and can play them with no restrictions, for ever after!
