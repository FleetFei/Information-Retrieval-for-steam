							DescriptionYOU... and who else? is an addictive Strategy game developed by Aldorlea Games (Asguaard, Moonchild, Dreamscape etc.).Recruit troops, improve your skills, conquer castles and progressively unite the world under one banner.Before entering the battlefield, use awards to enhance the capabilities of your generals, and then select one of them according to their units and skills to face off and defeat an enemy wave. Strategy is a key element. If you choose well, a general can defeat 3-4 enemy waves. But on the other hand, one mistake may have drastic consequences.Are you a good enough tactician to defeat all the enemy waves and conquer the world?Features10-20 hours of playtimeUp to 80 playable characters with their own strengths and weakness30+ locations to exploreTons of items to increase the strategic aspect4 difficulty modes and end ratingKnow your TroopsThe more you play the game, the more you can know about your own troops (and your enemy's, since they are identical) but also the monsters.The best strategies come with the greater knowledge of the game. It's important to note that, like your troops, monsters have levels, and can develop new skills and behaviors as they level up.For instance, the rat cannot poison early on, but can at higher levels.The best tactic is to pick a general that will suffer little to no damage against a wave. If you're able to predict how the enemy side will behave, you can emerge victorious!A General gets a 3rd unit at Lv3 and a 4th (and final) unit at Lv6. Try to have your most important Generals reach these levels as soon as possible by letting them kill the final wave (gives the most experience points) or awarding them with medals that give extra experience points or levels.NB: All achievements in this game can be obtained in Conquest Mode.Basic TroopsTo know the attributes of a character or troop, look into the equipment menu (WPN TYPE).TALENT(S) indicates what the character is able to do.THE ARCHER: has pre-emptive hitsTHE DUELLIST: counters hitsTHE CHAMPION: counters skillsTHE CRUSADER: has a very strong defenseTHE WIZARD: is the master of fire magicTHE THIEF: can steal a few gold coins every fightTHE MUSKETEER: has pre-emptive hitsTHE PROTECTOR: decreases damage taken by any party memberTHE MIMIC: gets stronger with more goldTHE ACROBAT: can tame the enemyTHE BEASTMISTRESS: can tame and seduce the enemyTHE LANCER: hits twiceTHE PRIESTESS: can learn a strong spell against dark enemiesTHE VAMPIRE: is deadly against humans and can seduce themTHE ZOMBIE: is even deadlier against humans and can tear them apartTHE SPIDER: hits multiple timesTHE DARK KNIGHT: deals crazy damageAND MANY MORE TO DISCOVER!
