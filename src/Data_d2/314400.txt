							Smugglers 5  is the fifth installment in the turn-based  single-player space trading game series. Will you be a greedy trader, an ambitious fleet pilot or a ruthless pirate? Board enemy ships, manage factories, conquer star systems and forge your own galactic empire - ultimately, your actions will have an impact on a galactic scale.This downloadable content (DLC) is a compilation of background stories for the indie game "Smugglers 5: Secession" and is named after the first of the three stories. Upon installation, the player can choose to play one of three short but dynamic and multiple-pathed background stories, which will lead the player through the game.The first story, "The Smugglers Guild", starts with the retirement of your trader father through ill health. There's no money in being an honest trader these days. Smuggling contraband is a risky business, but the rewards are great - especially for those lucky or connected enough to join the exclusive Smugglers Guild. "The Smugglers Guild" is playable with "Smugglers 5: Secession" and "Smugglers 5: Invasion".The second story, "Thirst For Vengeance", recalls the pirate raiders that killed your parents and kidnapped your sister when you were a child. As a graduate of the space academy with a ship of your own, the time has finally come to seek your revenge.In the final story, "SolomonÂ´s Treasure", your father dedicated his life to finding the hidden treasure of Solomon McTavish, legendary pirate, and died without success. Perhaps you can do better - but you are not the only one seeking this vast fortune.
