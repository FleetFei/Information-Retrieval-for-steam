It means that Astroneer is still very early in to its development. We've designed Astroneer from the ground-up to be a game that is developed in Early Access. When you first play the game, you will notice that the core gameplay is there but that we have a lot of work ahead of us. In addition to the features mentioned above, here's what you can expect of a game like Astroneer that is in pre-alpha:Core gameplay and features implemented (see above bullet points). BugsCrashesLost save gamesUnstable multiplayer experienceIf you think our core gameplay is compelling enough to want to support Astroneer while its still in pre-alpha, we'd love to have your support. Otherwise, we recommend waiting until Astroneer is out of PRE-alpha and in an alpha state where the game is more stable and gameplay and content is further along. We're committed to making Astroneer the best it can be and including you this early in to its development is a crucial step that that.If you're curious about the direction we're aiming to take Astroneer in, be sure to check out our road map.
