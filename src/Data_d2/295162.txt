The British Railways Standard Class 4 is a class of steam locomotive built during the 1950s primarily for mixed traffic use on secondary routes.

The 4-6-0 locomotive, designed by R.A. Riddles, was essentially a tender version of the Standard 4 2-6-4T, with similar characteristics to the GWR Manor Class, but built to the universal loading gauge.

A total of 80 locomotives were built at the BR Swindon Works between May 1951 and May 1957. The class was initially allocated to the London Midland Region and the Western Region; the last 15 were allocated to the Southern Region, albeit with BR1B tenders.

Withdrawals of the Class began in October 1964 and all had ceased mainline operation by August 1968. Six locomotives have survived into preservation, with two in operation on preserved railways in the UK.
