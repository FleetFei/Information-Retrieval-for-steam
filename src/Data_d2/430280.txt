							About This Game
							The small and independent  Nordic Mist Team presents Nature Defenders! 
Nature is in danger and the animals have decided to do something about it! Nature Defenders is a tower defense game where you must organize your lines of defense with the intention that humans do not continue deforesting and killing nature. There are five scenarios, rainforest, forest, industrial, desert and tundra, each with its inherent characters which were mixed as the game progresses.

The game takes advantage of having been developed in 3D, with swap positions, air strikes, changes of camera and much more!
