							About This Game
							Chicken Invaders puts you at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have hatched a devious plan to block out sunlight and freeze Earth to death. It's up to you to travel around the galaxy in order to piece together an ancient artifact and (quite literally) save the day.

Hero's log, Stardate 8008.5

As the last intergalactic chicken invaders flee our Solar System
and lingering feathers still smolder in interplanetary space,
I ease up on the trigger and wipe the sweat from my brow.
My work here is done.

Saving the world sure works up an appetite.
I'm plotting a course for the nearest Space Burger.
I think I'll have the spicy chicken wings tonight.
Or perhaps their galaxy-renowned chicken pie?
Ah, the choices of a hero are never easy.

Suddenly, I am yanked back to reality by the whine
of my trusty spaceship's automated warning system.
Why are all my dashboard lights flashing red?
Why has the Earth darkened so?
And why does it all have to happen just as I'm about to eat? 

Looks like tonight's dinner will have to wait...
