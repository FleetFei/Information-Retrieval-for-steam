							About This Game
							The Shrouded Isle is a human sacrifice cult simulator in which you play as the high priest  of a secluded island village, preparing for the awakening of a dark god by purging sinners in your community. Each member of the village is randomly generated with hidden traits-some virtuous, others heretical. As high priest, you must uncover and kill the heretics, while carefully maintaining the loyalty of their powerful aristocratic families.

Closely examine your citizenry to find the best strategy for your people and your beliefs. Families may not like it if you choose their favorite children to sacrifice on the altar.
