							By popular demand your favorite developer has given their level designers the task of creating even more retro extravaganza in the same spirit as the Toader level of the main release. 
									This map pack contains new levels that bring back the irrepressible charm, and also that daunting touch of hardcore difficulty, that could only be found in the 80’s. They are inspired by famous levels found in legendary NES titles and carry names such as It’s a me, Hamilton! and Dungeon #9.
									Accompanying the levels are brand new and shiny achievements to ensure that your bragging rights are properly boosted as well.
