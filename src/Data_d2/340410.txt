							About This Game
							SuperBike TT is a single-player, physics-based racing game within a multi-team and multi-bike livery for built-in replayability. SuperBike TT is inspired by classic console   racing games as well as the popular Isle of Man TT, considered the most challenging motorcycle race in the world. With these influences in mind, we’re creating an epic, replayable VR SuperBike Time Trial racing game for you to race for the best times on the world’s most difficult tracks.

Core Game Features

• Racing control via keyboard or Microsoft 360 Wireless Dual Stick Controller
