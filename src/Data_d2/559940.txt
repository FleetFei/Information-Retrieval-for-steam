							About This Game
							Years have passed since our hero Sleengster has defeated the Tikkirama for the first time. But the enemy is regrouping. 

Betrayal and anger has led to the regrowth of the Tikkirama Organisation and all Sleengpeople are in danger. This time no mistakes, they have attacked during winter.

The only thing on their mind is the gems, they need to steal as much of them as they can to disrupt the Sleengpower.

One more battle, Sleengster has to decide about the future of his homeland. Will he be brave enough to go through the winter hell once again and burn some tikki heads? 

Or will he be too weak to last on the cold air of Tikkirama evil. This is where you get in! 

Help your old Sleengster pass 30 completely new levels and dive through the ice cold waters swarming with vicious murderfish. Enemies stronger than ever, cold resistant
and very angry!

Do you have what it takes to sleeng them off and save the sacred gems?
