"Summer:Message on the Paper Plane" is the first chapter released. The other three chapters will be released later as DLC."Paper Plane" is a partly nonlinear story about childhood memories. Collecting all pieces from different point-of-view, then the truth will emerge.This is our second project, if you are interested in our previous work, please visit Gaokao.Love.100Days.
