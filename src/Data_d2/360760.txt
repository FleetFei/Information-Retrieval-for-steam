							About This Game
							Global warming, hunger, poverty, terrorism, epidemic on planetary scale and mutant invasion to cap things off, all entangled into one tight Gordian knot of doom â€” this post-apocalyptic panoply makes a perfect background for fast and ruthless MMOFPS such as Run and Fire! The world of near future definitely needs a whole team of super soldiers to sort the mess out. Hot-blooded gunfights, where both realistic and futuristic weaponry can be put to use, along with tons of cooperative and competitive experience in 10 different game modes deliver everything you would expect from an online shooter which means business. Run and Fire has some additional trump card up its sleeve: fairly good graphics which comes with reasonably moderate system requirements. You can enjoy this game even on the most basic PC!
