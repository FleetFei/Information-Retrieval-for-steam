							About This Game
							Nobunaga’s Ambition, a series synonymous with Historical Simulation Games, has now released an extension of the 13th release in that series, Nobunaga’s Ambition: Tendou, at the Steam Store as Nobunaga’s Ambition: Tendou w/Power-up Kit!
On a beautiful 3D map of Japan, players not only fight over castles, but also find a new strategical element in fighting to whittle down their opponent’s territory. For the power-up kit, we have added a new element, “Culture,” that expands the depths of the game’s strategies. Battles become deeper, more brilliant and more exciting.
The popular edit mode has been upgraded. 
And with the AI Editor, a series first, you can even adjust how the computer itself thinks.
