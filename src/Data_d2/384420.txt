							About This Video
							Creature Factory 2 is the second installment of the original Open Movie Workshop DVD. However, this is not a simple refresh, it's an entirely different workflow. Like the first part of the series, Creature Factory 2 is not meant to be a simple follow-along tutorial. Instead we witness an inspiring creative process from start to finish.

Originally published on cloud.blender.org - August 2014. 

Total duration: 13 hours, 45 chapters.
