							The name says it all; become a legend on planet Nexus.

This unique collection of items will see you take your rightful place as a legend among mere mortals. You’ll have 90 days of Signature, as well as a ton of flasks, which all ensure you get more; more XP, more gold, more OmniBits, more from gathering professions—more of pretty much everything. Add to that some C.R.E.D.D., which you can sell for gold on the in-game exchange, or redeem for more Signature time, as well as mounts (including an insanely fun hoverboard), weapon cosmetics, a pet, and … OH! Have you ever asked what kind of a house a legend might live in? How about in a freakin’ black hole!? This unique housing plot addition gives you an otherworldly experience as you max and relax in a gravitational field that only your awesomeness can escape.

This is truly befitting of a legend, and its contents are valued at more than double what the bundle is being sold for here.

The C.R.E.D.D. in this pack can only be redeemed or exchanged on the Entity realm.
