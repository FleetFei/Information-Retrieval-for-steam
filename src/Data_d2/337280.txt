							Planetship is both a planet AND a ship, it's also a party bus holo-lounge spice freighter rocket boosting thorium burning well oiled supermachine, get it? You will after a harrowing yet surprisingly relaxing journey through the chaotic void realms of strangespace!

So here's the deal, you've got to find a new planet for humanity to call home in the far future, a real nice spot with all the trimmings: liquid water, the right temperature, not too much or too little mass and atmospheric conditions conducive to keeping homo sapiens alive. We've even done a pile of research FOR you and marked habitable zones with the potential for an Earth-like planet on your starmap, so navigate yourself to a green zone and pick out a cozy little pad for the crew. What could possibly go wrong?

P.S. - One little thing, if you're going to pilot this craft we're going to have to shed your body from your brain and hook wires up to whatever's left, Dr. Scienceman here says it's the only way for you to survive the trip. You're cool with that right? Great.
