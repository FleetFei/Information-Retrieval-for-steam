							About This Game
							Inspired by the "BIG TRAK" toy we created a funny programming game ( coding game ) with bonsai trees  mental robots  and a broken rocket  Bob  (a bot ) has just woke up on a lost planet. He lost all of his limbs  somehow, and has no idea of what has happened. He is a little bit crazy, but he can communicate with you.. You don't have much clue of what to do either, but since you are a little bit smarter than Bob you are in charge. Bob's battery is now nearly empty, coincidentally there is battery pack  just up the road ahead. If he goes and gets it himself, he will trip over and fall down the pit. Your first task is to look at the path and send him instructions on how to get there.Bob is very happy you are going on this adventure with him because you will help him find his lost limbs, which are currently scattered around, and also plenty of oil tins . You are admired for your ingenuity in guiding Bob through this difficult journey.Not everything will be happiness though. Bob will find himself in challenging situations and you both will need to fight for survival.Features: Advance commands: Repeat, loops, switch command based on Bob's facing direction, branch command that check if Bob can step ahead, picking up, dropping,  punching, waiting... and many more. Highly polished environment, relaxing mood and music to massage your brain during its high power usage. Funny dialogues. Leader-board for shortest sequences.
