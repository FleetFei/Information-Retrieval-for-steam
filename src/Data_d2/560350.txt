							About This Game
							Two figures appear in the scope of your rifle; an enraged attacker and his trembling hostage.  In one single moment, all your training comes down to these two faces in the crosshairs, and your finger on the trigger.  The shot is yours.

It's all in a day's work for members of the most elite force in crime fighting history: SWAT, the Special Weapons And Tactics team.  Now you can experience this relentless adrenaline-pumping action firsthand as you begin your training as a SWAT officer.  After instruction in actual SWAT tactics and target training sessions your skills will be called into action in multiple scenarios and career-advancing missions.

Innocent lives rely on your split-second decision making and your team's courage in the face of incredible danger.
