							About This Game
							Kindled Cavern is a cave exploration adventure for the HTC Vive filled with sights to behold. Waterfalls, bamboo forests, giant turtles, abandoned bridges and scaffolding, subterranian lakes, and ancient arches fill this explorable cavern. Not to mention the ghosts!

Fight off enemies, solve puzzles, and collect gold!
There are seven oil pedestals scattered around the cave. All of them must be lit in order to escape the cave.

Your best time and score are saved, so you can replay to do better!
