							About This Game
							Slinki is a hard-as-nails 2.5D action-platformer where your own prosthetic arm is the ultimate multipurpose weapon: Use it as a bladed boomerang to control the population of mutated critters, pull levers towards you to get through puzzles and zip-line across grappling surfaces. Furthermore, instead of having your weapon return to you, why not return to it instead with the power of Slinki's slingshot? All this to find out what happened to the once peaceful forest you used to live in.PlotSlinki's once peaceful and smooth-running home has gone horribly wrong, with every denizen gone crooked and twisted, and irrevocably hostile. Himself affected and warped as well, Slinki can just sit there and waste away, or take the last of his strength to the Forest's Core, and end the misery whatever ill-bred rascal thought to fester in it's depths.DemoThis is the demo version of Slinki and thus only features 2 levels of hot bladed bunny action!Demo saves are compatible with the full version.
