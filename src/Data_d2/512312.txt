							Built after the Second World War but predating the first British Railways designs, the LMS-styled ‘Porthole’ coaches are so named because of their distinctive circular toilet window designs. Features which provide a clue as to the type’s post-war build era include later-style ventilators and window vents. This pack includes coaches in British Railways Maroon and British Railways Crimson Lake & Cream liveries.Models included in BR Porthole Coach Pack 02: BTKFKSK
