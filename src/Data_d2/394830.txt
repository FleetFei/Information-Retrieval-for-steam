							For progress, for humanity… for science! Responsible for many of mankind’s greatest achievements, science has done many wonderful things. But experiments to harness the power of shadow? If it sounds dangerous, that’s probably because it is. Especially if something goes wrong and harmless light becomes the deadliest thing imaginable…Set in a world where the rules of light and shadow no longer apply, One Upon Light sees you exploring the ruined remains of the Aurora Science’s labs in search of answers. What happened here? Who are you? And, most importantly, will things ever be the same again? The answers are there to find but whatever you do, don’t go into the light…Top-down puzzle gameplay sees you using the unique properties of light and shadow to explore and overcome obstacles.Use switches, blocks, carts and other techniques to create shadows, blocking out the light that will otherwise end your adventure…Use the power of the Shadow Echo to ‘record’ shadows as they appear, then use them to progress even if the real shadow vanishes.Visually charming and inspired by classic black and white cartoons, One Upon Light is a true test of skill, brains and photophobia!
