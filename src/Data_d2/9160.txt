							About This Game
							Introducing the Master Levels for DOOM II. Twenty never-before-seen levels all with the same acid drenched, hell spawned horror of the originals. Each was created by independent designers and supervised by the demented minds of id Software. You might as well forget about seeing the light of day ever again.
