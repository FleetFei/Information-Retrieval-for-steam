							*****************************************************
Important: This game has no online functionality. It is LAN (Local Area Network) only. This means you have to be connected to the same router as your friends. This game could not be free otherwise.

CAGE is a twist on the classic LAN arena shooter. It features lightning-fast gameplay fully exploiting all three dimensions of motion. The "tether" allows for unprecedented freedom and agility of movement, creating explosive action unlike any other shooter.

Features:
- 4 Maps: ThreeTowers, Stalks, Port, and Struct
- 3 GameModes: Deathmatch, KeepAway, and King of the (moving) Hill
- 9 powerful, satisfying weapons

CAGE is, and will always be, completely free to play, with no microtransactions. This game has been my passion project for the last few months, and I want as many people as possible to play it.

Bringing back the LAN party!
