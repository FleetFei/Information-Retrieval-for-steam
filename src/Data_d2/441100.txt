							Helmed by Rob Zombie, this gore fest follows two young couples on their quest to find the truth about a mythical character known only as "Dr. Satan." Set in rural Texas in the 1970s, the group gets more than they bargained for when they find themselves stranded in an all-too-realistic house of horrors.
