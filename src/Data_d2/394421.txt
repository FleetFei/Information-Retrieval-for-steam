Seductive, beautiful and immortal witches had amassed great powers over the centuries. They lived in pyramids in forgotten sand valleys, unseen by any travellers. Having lost their trust in men, they would kidnap only girls from local villages, choosing those who had a magical gift. The little girls were taught sorcery. Year after year, local women would find crystal balls in empty cradles. One could see the faces of kidnapped babies in cold glass.
