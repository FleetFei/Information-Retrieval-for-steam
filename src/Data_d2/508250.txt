							Aussie Sports VR invites you into Australia’s sporting community to meet the players, see the fans, feel the passion and be a spectator at major events. In a first of its kind, you can also test your sporting skills through five interactive games that are integrated into the experience. 

Sports diplomacy is an increasingly important aspect of diplomatic practice and a growing part of the global sports industry. Sport is a universal language and plays a unique role in shaping and showcasing Australia’s identity, values and culture. Australia has a remarkable international sporting pedigree and is internationally recognized as a consistent, high-performing sporting nation. Australia is also a leader in developing grassroots sport and elite pathways that include women, girls and people with disability.

Australia believes that sport, like technology, has the power to bring people together in meaningful ways and overcome geography and language barriers. We are proud to bring them together in this unique sports diplomacy experience.
