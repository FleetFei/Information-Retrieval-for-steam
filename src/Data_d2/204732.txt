							Meet Dr. Cerebro, one of the most notorious medical practitioners in Solside, is a free-digger who alternates between scavenging the dark and treacherous passages of the Underside and serving time in the care of the Solside penal system (for repeatedly being caught red-handed while doing the former.)

Long days without sunlight in a cell can take your mind on a ride and the ever changing and hostile Underside is no picnic for anyoneâ€™s sanity.  Dr Cerebro is starting to show worrying signs of losing it completely, and wearing that strange device as a replacement for the good old human cranium, is certainly not helping. 

Nevertheless - his skills are not to be trifled with and you will not regret hiring him to your team.
