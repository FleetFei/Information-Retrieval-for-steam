							Cole Black is a man with questions…
Or so he is told. 
When he awakes in an old abandoned asylum, his sole memory is the attempted rescue of a teenage girl with a bomb strapped to her chest. Everything else is blank.
With a strange technology fused to his head - used to read and replay human memory - Black travels into the depths of his own mind. To find the truth of his past. To find the truth of what happened. And to answer two very simple questions:
‘Why were you there?’ and, ‘Who was the girl?’
