							Having friends over for a VR party? BuffalSnow Blizzard is an alternate version of Tornuffalo that adds asymmetric gameplay. The first version of BuffalSnow Blizzard was released on Christmas morning as a beta branch of Tornuffalo.In 2016, the world was rocked by a freak weather phenomenon known as the "Tornuffalo."  As fall turned to winter, you thought you had survived nature's worst.Now, in the darkest days of winter, a terrible blizzard is sweeping the country.Shivering in the storm, you hear the patter of hooves above you. Through the snow, you see a shimmering red light soaring through the air. What a jolly sight! Could it be Rudolph?  No. It's Garth, the red-nosed buffalo. And the Buffalizzard is only just beginning.This alternate version of Tornuffalo adds snow and "red-nosed buffalo"--have your friends take turns controlling these bison by using the keyboard!HOW TO PLAY:One player puts on the VR headset. The other players take turns controlling buffalo from the computer. As each buffalo flys by, you pass the keyboard/gamepad to a new person at the computer. When the VR player dies, the person who was controlling the computer at the time gets to be the VR player.
