							About This Game
							Outwit gravity, race the clock, explore new worlds.Crashed lander is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and Space Taxi. You've built a janky craft out of propane tanks and spare parts. Pilot it  from pad to pad trying to beat your best time – then flirt with that fine line between speed and control. If you’re brave enough to try Hard Mode you’ll be flopping around like a QWOPy, low gravity turtle. With a little practice you’ll be zippin' around doin' barrel rolls. You’ll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics – bizarre, organic shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas. Each level is a detailed hand-crafted landscape that encourages the player to explore - and goof around! You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift.
