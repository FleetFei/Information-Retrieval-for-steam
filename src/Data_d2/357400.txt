On the way we discover that love - biological, spiritual, and even mechanical - can flourish in all kinds of ways.MARS is a feature length animated sci-fi, rom-com featuring Mark Duplass, Zoe Simpson, Paul Gordon, Howe Gelb, Kinky Friedman, Cynthia Watros, Liza Weil, James Kochalka, and Michael Dolan. Told in the playful style of a graphic novel, MARS is equal parts character driven story, homage to our galactic neighbor, and exploration of why we explore.Completely independently made animation and processing hybrid feature film. Shot and animated in Austin, Texas. A cult film that appeals to science nerds, animation fans, off beat comedy appreciators, and anybody willing to try a little different type of film. Family friendly, but weird enough for adults!Directed by: Geoff MarslettProduced by: Anish Savjani, Robert Howell, Javier Bonafont, Geoff Marslett
