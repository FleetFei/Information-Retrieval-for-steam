							About This Game
							After Reset RPG is an old-school hardcore sci-fi post-apocalyptic roleplaying game. You can expect: a post-apocalyptic open world developed with scientific realism, a nonlinear story with the freedom of choice and a ton of branches and endings, and hardcore game mechanics in the best traditions of classic CRPGs. Explore the devastated ruins of the dead planet and forge your story, Commander!IMPORTANT NOTES:Please keep in mind, this is an OLD version that we prepared for our first trial on KickStarter at the end of 2014. Additionally, please know that this build is just a demonstration of the graphics level, camera view and general atmosphere of the game.Video graphics are not yet optimized but they looks nice and go more than 80fps on GeForce GTX 780 for sure. So if this build runs smoothly on your machine â€“ you can count the same (frankly, even better) performance while playing the Prologue or final complete game.If you like our tech demo, feel free to back our development by purchasing After Reset RPG Early Access on Steam.Thank you for your support and have fun!Sincerely,Black Cloud Studios.
