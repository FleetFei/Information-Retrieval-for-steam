							The 4VEP Add-On takes you back to the days of the classic ‘slam-door’ commuter trains on the Woking-Portsmouth Line.The 4VEP (‘Vestibule Electro Pneumatic’), named the Class 423 under the British Rail TOPS classification system, was one of the ‘slam-door’ electric multiple units that formed the backbone of rail passenger transport in southern England from the 1960s until after 2000. EMU’s like the 4VEP were a part of daily life to hundreds of thousands of commuters, with the persistent slamming of their doors signalling the imminent departure of another busy service. Each 4-car set was powered by 750-volt DC electricity supplied via a third rail, giving a top speed of 90mph. Built by BREL at York, these classic EMUs served for almost 40 years, their high-density seating layouts and performance proving adequate for their role until the introduction of the more modern ‘Dersiro’ units.
