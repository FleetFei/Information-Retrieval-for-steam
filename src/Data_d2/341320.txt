							Venture back into the time where 16 bit ruled in the days of the Super Nintendo System and Sega Genesis. Deity Quest takes you on this journey and beyond as you listen to various themes of the characters and locations of Aberos. 

I was challenged to compose the music for Deity Quest with 8 and 16 bit sounds and fuse it with modern instruments. I feel that I have achieved this goal and incidentally created a new sound I can call my own. 

My inspirations I drew from creating this album were mostly JRPGS that I have played when I was young on Game Boy and PSX. Such as Pokemon, Final Fantasy Legend II, Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, Dragonball Z: Supa Saiya Densetsu, Crusader of Centy. And others I have played as an adult like Final Fantasy X and Nier Gestalt. I give credit to all of the composers of those games because they are the ones that sparked the inspiration in the beginning before I became a composer. Thank you.

One of my best friends, Michael Muranaka, aka DJ Muranaka got a sneak peek of the album and was so inspired by one of the tracks that he did a remix of it. It is titled, "City in the Sky (Muranasty Remix)". He also did the album cover art. Santiago Ocampo, the artist for Deity Quest, did the logo.

I would like to thank David Maletz for being super reliable and reasonable with my schedule for the opportunity to do music and sound for the game. 

I'd like to also thank Leslie-Anne Snipes for always believing in my talent, my art and listening to double the hours of all this music while I composed, mixed, and mastered.
