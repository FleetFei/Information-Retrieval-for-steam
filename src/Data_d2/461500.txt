							About This Game
							Strap into your very own nuclear-powered jetpack and blast into the skies of Omega Island, a volcanic sea enclave converted to a vast, intricate super-spy training facility. Soar high above its mountainous peaks for an eagle-eye view, or power dive into the underground base to get up close and physical. Test your piloting skills by weaving through the dense roads of the cityscape, or boost from rooftop to rooftop to find the quickest routes to success.

Omega Island is an aerial open world where the visceral freedom of a jetpack lets you achieve your goals, your way. Step by step, you too can rise through the ranks of the elite to graduate as the ultimate spy, the elusive ‘Omega Agent’.
