							About This Game
							From the folk who brought you classic Kaiju titles like "Godzilla: Save the Earth", "Rampage: Total Destruction", and "Deadliest Warrior" comes the next generation of monster-on-monster fighting action: Colossal Kaiju Combat! Funded by the CKC community, our plan is to release 2-3 new games each year, showcasing features & characters selected by our fans!

Our first release: "Kaijuland Battles" features 4 cartoony kaiju from the (now sadly defunct) Kaijuland game. This is our "bare bones" release - we'll iterate to really tune our core combat mechanics & controls during Early Access.

Our next CKC game (The Fall of Nemesis) launches next year with 9 original characters designed & voted on by our fans, and 2 special boss characters designed by guest contributors Jeremy Robinson & Monster Attack Team.

CKC features 1-4 players, online or off. Gamepad control only - YOU MUST HAVE A GAMEPAD TO PLAY!
