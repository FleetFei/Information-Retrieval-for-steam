							About This Game
							You are no hero, no saviour, you are just a simple farmer by the name of Greather. 

Your wife left to get some supplies early this morning, but she has not returned as of yet and the sun has now set. 
You know how harsh the lands beyond your village can be. 

Venture across this open Medieval world in search of your wife Ellyn.
Complete tasks given to you by others while on your journey, do whatever you can to find her.

Criminals and other foul creatures roam the wild, so make sure you are prepared before venturing out too far into the wilderness.
