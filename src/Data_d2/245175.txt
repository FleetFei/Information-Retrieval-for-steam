							Big Band's in full swing!

Once a cop known as Ben Birdland, he fell flat when he got on the wrong side of New Meridian's corrupt police force. Birdland was broken and bent out of shape by his former colleagues, but was tuned up by Dr. Avian and ASG Lab 8. Now he is armed with a full ensemble of pneumatic weaponry, making him the full fortissimo instrument of justice: "Big Band."

Thanks to the incredible support of Skullgirls’ fans, Big Band is the second of 5 additional characters funded by Lab Zero’s Indiegogo campaign to be added to Skullgirls Encore. Big Band is Skullgirls's first male character, and lives up to his name with unique gameplay mechanics that take advantage of his tremendous size and musical motif.

Big Band features the same stunning, feature-quality animation and great gameplay you've come to expect from Skullgirls and Lab Zero Games, as well as a story mode and detailed tutorials so you can learn more about him and the Skullgirls world!
