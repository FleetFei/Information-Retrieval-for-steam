							About This Game
							An extension of the 12th release in the Nobunaga’s Ambition series, Nobunaga’s Ambition: Iron Triangle, has appeared at the Steam Store as Nobunaga’s Ambition: Iron Triangle w/Power-up Kit!
This game is the first in the series to employ a single 3D map for the game to play out on. On this map in 3D, castles and towns are built and developed, attacked and defended across Japan and grand naval battles take place on the Inland sea. 
In addition, over 80 techniques can be developed using the “Tech Innovation System” and then used in battle to win a strategic victory.
Furthermore, the power-up kit brings you a variety of new and powerful additions, including the Foreign technique, in which using special goods for trade is the key, and many more.
