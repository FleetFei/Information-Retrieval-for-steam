							About This Game
							A mystery puzzle adventure 

Michael is an ambitious explorer searching for a secret treasure. Finding himself trapped in the dark pyramid of Khaba, a weak ray of sunlight becomes his only hope. 

Through chambers filled with puzzles, Michael must reflect this beam against orbs and dusty mirrors to pass each test. When a lit stone opens one passage, another one is blocked and each chamber becomes a further test of patience and reason. 

As Michael descends deeper into the pyramid, every solved puzzle will also unfold new parts of his troubled story. Almost as if the pyramid itself is testing Michael, an optional story about the dead Pharaoh will demand alternative solutions to each puzzle – but also expose the true nature of Michael’s past.
