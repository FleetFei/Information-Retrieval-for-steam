From drawing a rain cloud for growing plants to drawing an axe for chopping down a gate, you control all aspects of your environment. Explore diverse environments and encounter unusual creatures as you draw your way through 14 levels (plus a hidden bonus level)! With the non-linear gameplay, how you overcome one environment will determine which level you unlock next.
