SPECIAL ABILITIES -

If you defeat another character in battle, you deliver a crippling blow, slowing their movement to 1 space for their next turn.

Whenever you land on a space with a character, you may make a heroic leap and move to the next space in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). You may only leap over one space at a time.

Add 2 to your Strength in battle if you are not using a weapon.
