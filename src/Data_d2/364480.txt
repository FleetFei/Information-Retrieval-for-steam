							Venture into the darkness of the Dream Forest and discover why it's now called "Cursed". Meet interesting characters in a psychological adventure, solve puzzles and learn all about the story of Artuo, the knight who wants to be a wizard; Red, a fire goblin that was summoned by Artuo; Melchior, the wizard of dreams and his companions. Red Goblin takes inspiration from a host of old school retro platformers. With that in mind, you will die, a lot, and when you think you have mastered the game you will die again. However don't let that turn you off!
