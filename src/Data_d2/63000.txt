							About This Game
							YOU ARE THE DRAGON:						Scare villages!						Burn castles!						Collect gold and gems!						Kidnap princesses!						Roast pesky knights!						Fend off thieves!						Topple giants!						Build a hoard of treasure!						Compete or cooperate with other dragons in epic multiplayer battles!						Your goal is simple, but challenging: build the biggest pile of gold that you can!						Every action you take will have an effect on your score in this “stratecade” game that 1UP observes “hides a surprising layer of complexity and strategy.” To be the best, you’ll need to fly deftly, upgrade smartly, and use powerups to your advantage.  Most of all, you’ll need to control the kingdom around you: Burn the crops to the ground or let them grow? Keep towns in ruins or let them flourish? In HOARD™, the dragon is in charge.						In the words of PlatformNation, “Buy this game. Right.
