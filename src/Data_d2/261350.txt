Although it is unknown whether it has always been this way or whether the islands were once a part of something far below, Stratians are well-adapted to their setting. Societies have been established on the largest of the sky islands, and their peoples have learned to use flox--the very mineral that keeps their world afloat--and other natural resources to their advantage.
