							Old Ivian warriors still remember this glorious battle and tell its story to those eager to listen. In a harsh winter many years ago the orcish hordes of the West assaulted Great Oakendom and caught the wise elves unprepared. A brave Elvari queen went to seek help from the Allianceâ€™s closest neighbors. Many noble knights, soldiers and even common villagers answered her call. She led them in a thunderous counter-attack against the raging invaders. Men and Nature fought together this day to protect the forest, and they emerged victorious!ContentOne preconstructed deck - Soldier Reverence (1 hero + 60 cards)GameplanAssault your enemies with tough and versatile soldiers with this deck.
