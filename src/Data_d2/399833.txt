							Shadow falls across the land - the midnight hour is close at hand. An Army of the Undead has risen from their graves and Baron Dreadfort himself commands the ghosts and ghouls that wander the streets. He speaks to you from beyond the void, sending shivers down your spine, yet beckoning you to participate in a game of Awesomenauts. The battlefields you have visited before appear as from a nightmare, and it feels as if on this particular night, there is so much more at stake than just your life...

The Ghosthouse Announcer can be activated from the character select menu or the in-game menu. Activating this Announcer will replace the default announcements made during regular gameplay with a whole new set.
