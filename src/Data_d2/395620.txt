							Ittle and Tippsie crash onto yet another island filled with loot, puzzles and mysterious inhabitants! With the help of a magical map, they set out to steal eight pieces of a raft from increasingly improbable locations including beaches, prairies, an art exhibit and some dude's basement.

Ittle Dew 2 is a charming and humorous 3D Action Adventure game with a focus on exploration and combat.
