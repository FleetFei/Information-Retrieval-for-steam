							First days of the German operation "Blau" in the summer of 1942 in the Oskol river area. The Wehrmacht 6 Army dealt a crushing blow at the boundary of the 28 and 21 RKKA Armies, forcing them to retreat in disorder to the Oskol river. To prevent the units of the Wehrmacht 6 Army from reaching the west bank of the river, the RKKA command redeployed the 91 TBde to Verhnyaya Lubyanka - the last point before the crossings near Volokonovka - with the objective to impede the enemy advance, and thus, gain time for the retreat of the battered RKKA units.Two operations of 6 turns for each of the parties (Verhnyaya Lubyanka, July 1, 1942).Precisely recreated area of over 60 sq. km: hilly plains with harsh terrain and extensive gullies.Historical organizational structure of units at the time of the offensive.
