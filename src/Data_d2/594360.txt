							About This Game
							"Sort ‘Em" lets you test your sorting skills by becoming a fruit sorter at your local grocery store! Keep the store in stock by sorting apples, oranges, strawberries and many more into bins! 

As the levels progress, you'll be introduced to new fruits, special fruits, trick shots, and a variety of challenges. Don’t let the pesky kid take fruits off the conveyor belt or you’ll lose points. Distract him with a candy bar and he’ll leave you alone! 

With two game modes, you can either play through the levels or choose time attack and sort as many fruits as you can before the time runs out! 

Put your hand-eye coordination to the test, or teach your kids how to sort. Sharpen up your sorting skills with "Sort ‘Em"!  

Supports HTC Vive and Oculus Rift+Touch.
