							Original music featured in Darwinia by DMA-SC and Trash80. DMA-SC's (Mathieu Stempell) interest in music grew from synthesised 8/16 bit computer game music and the demo music scene. Self-taught, using demo scene tools, DMA-SC's current passion is composing music on Atari ST's, and other old-skool systems. His passion is the challenge creating new music from such a limited sound chip.Trash80's (Timothy Lamb) name originated from a slang term for the Tandy TRS-80. He started the trash80 and tresk music projects in 2000 with the objective of using gameboys as musical instruments. Running Little Sound DJ software on 4 gameboys simultaneously has earned him a name for live performances.  Despite working towards a $12,000 recording studio, Trash80 says the gameboy will continue to serve as a front end for all his projects. Songs will be placed in your Darwinia folder in the Steam Directory: ...Steam\steamapps\common\Darwinia\SoundtrackTrack Listing DMA-SC - Visitors From Dreams Trash80 - Excuses Trash80 - Faces of a Fashion Trash80 - Pain Fade Down Trash80 - Impact of Silence Trash80 - Schroeders Failure
