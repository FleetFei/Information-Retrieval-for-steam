							About This Game
							Super Switch is a difficult platformer in which you have to actively switch between 2 dimensions. It's tougher than iron and extremely rewarding.

With the press of a button, you switch into another dimension, with it's own platform and traps.  Your job is to decide when to switch in order to avoid traps and land on platforms.


* A Xbox 360 controller for PC or similar device is highly recommended.  While this game has been tested and confirmed to be possible with a keyboard, some might find it frustrating.

* To change controls or resolution, hold Shift when launching the game.
