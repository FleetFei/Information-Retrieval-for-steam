							About This Game
							Kickoff Legends is a multi-player, cross-platform football management game. Matches are be played in real time. Any platform against any platform. As an owner of a team you are in charge of signing, training and developing your team. Once you have qualified for a league the real competition begins. During the match you are in charge of the team, not the players, you have to instruct your players. Make sure you give them the right instruction at the right time, did your opponent change their passing strategy, make sure your defence adapts. Are you ahead against a stronger opponent? Tell your players to hold on to the ball and ride out the game. Has a player on a different team caught your eye? Make him an offer he can't refuse to pry him out of your opponents lineup. Kickoff Legends is fast and fun with new features deployed twice a week. Join the ride now!
