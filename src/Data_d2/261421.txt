							The Goatperson DLC adds a new playable class to Desktop Dungeons' already large roster of characters. The Goatperson is a throwback to roguelike gameplay of yesteryear, answering the oft-asked question "What would Desktop Dungeons be like if you had to eat food like regular roguelikes?", the less-oft-asked question "What do Goatpeople eat anyways?" and the briefly-asked "Why did we just switch gods?".

This DLC also contains a new building, the aptly named Goat Glade, which houses a useful Item Lottery for players with more gold than sense, as well as a series of unique Triple Quests that pit players against three randomly generated dungeons in a row (reminiscent of the infamous campaign in the Desktop Dungeons alpha). Each Triple Quest reveals new knowledge about the world of Desktop Dungeons.
