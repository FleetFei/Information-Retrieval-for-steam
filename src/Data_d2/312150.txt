							Survival of the fittest: now with guns.Wild Warfare is a free-to-play, class and vehicle-based FPS, starring a colourful cast of critter mercs. Inspired by old school shooters, it seeks to capture the fun and fur-ious action of classic era multiplayer games. There ain't no regenerating health here. Wild Warfare is currently in Alpha. If you enjoy classic arcade action with well balanced gameplay, crazy characters, and bears with mini-guns, this is exactly that game. Wild Warfare features: Class-based combat - nimble rabbits with bludgeoning weapons, raccoons with assault rifles, and more on the way! Vehicle combat - Armoured Walkers transform the battlefield instantly with missiles! Customizable characters - deck out your animal with warpaint, hats, and backpacks! A bunch of game modes (Capture the Flag, Team Death Match, and Death Match)! Ranking and levelling up - earn your infamy! More of everything! This Alpha only scratches the surface of what's in store! No animals were harmed in the making of this game. But we encourage you to pick up the slack.
