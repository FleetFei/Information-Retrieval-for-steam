							WHAT IS HIT? 
HIT is a free game offered at no cost to players.  We do not have in-game purchases or DLC for sale.  As a small group of developers with limited resources, we want to give this game to you for free to enjoy.  We spent a lot of time balancing and enhancing the game throughout our development cycle, which often introduces bugs.  We did our very best to test for quality, but undoubtedly many issues have slipped through the cracks and we are continuing to address them.  We appreciate you understanding that HIT is not perfect, but we really want to share it with all of you and hope that you can see the love we have put into it.
