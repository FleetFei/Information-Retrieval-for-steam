							A famous man once said that music has charms to soothe a savage beast. The savage beast in question was not a Skroggle though, as when the man tried to use music to calm one he found himself, his music, and his notebook eaten. 

However, legend speaks of a Skroggle that once ate an entire mariachi band. Though fulfilled, he never felt the same afterwards. He left his world-eating ways, wandered into the desert, and was never heard from again. One day a stranger walked into the town that had not heard a single song since the fateful day their mariachi band was eaten by a Skroggle. The stranger sat down, placed the weedlings he held in his robes beside him, and together they proceeded to play.

Mariachi never dies. Gnariachi was born.

This DLC contains a custom skin for Gnaw in Awesomenauts. The Gnariachi skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for weedlings.

If you have not already unlocked the character, purchasing this DLC will do so.
