							Faster, higher, stronger – 3DZUG is upping the ante!
Eagerly awaited, now it's finally here: our brand new laadgs vehicle transporter!

You can again enjoy virtually unlimited possibilities in terms of task building. Different, and sometimes unusual, versions can be generated using the industry function. Carry small vans, containers or even a low-floor tram: it's entirely in your hands! Design the train just the way you want.

Once again, there is a highly detailed car awaiting you, with appropriate sound, train tail plates and dynamic numbers. Different individual configuration options ensure maximum gaming fun. For the first time, the car also adjusts its look to the wintery conditions. Two tasks for the Niddertal Railway are included in the delivery.

Come on board and experience maximum variety with great attention to detail!
