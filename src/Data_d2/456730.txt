							Valhalla Hills â€“ Fire Mountains!

With the Fire Mountains expansion comes a new mountain terrain type: volcanic mountains on lava. 

This landscape typically bears a stony soil full of mineral resources. 

On the other hand, this ground is hostile to life and green meadows are extremely rare. 
There are some spells that can help you here. You can summon and activate them on the sacrificial altars.
