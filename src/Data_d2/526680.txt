							About This Game
							Lifeliqe VR Museum brings Lifeliqe's interactive learning experiences into VR for the first time! 

Learn about a cell, join ancient dinosaurs for a walk, or visit a prehistoric settlement that dates back to the seventh millennium B.C.  

These immersive learning experiences empower students to spark light bulb moments. By visualizing scientific concepts and environments that would be otherwise unaccessible, learners can boost their curiosity and learning passion.  Lifeliqe is an engaging learning world that learners will love and adults will wish they could have in schools when they were kids.
