							About This Game
							A licensed adaptation of an original 1980s fantasy gamebook, faithfully recreated with new soundtrack and artwork. Player choices lead to 22 different endings!

All your life, you dream of adventure: knights, dragons, magic rings, chests of gold, and all the danger and glory that awaits a professional swordswoman. But every dream has a cost. You are on your way across the desert wastes to compete in the Warrior Games when your caravan is attacked. Orcs and bandits murder your father, capture your companions, and leave you for dead.

Now alone in the world, will you choose to seek glory, vengeance, treasure... or love?

Your choices might make you into a hero, or a queen, or leave you buried forever in the dragon's lair.
