							There are countless dimensions that are quite similar to ours, yet with subtle differences. In one of these dimensions, wars are not fought with weapons, but with music. Those that we know as mercenaries are the most amazing musicians in the other dimension, and they've enraptured countless worlds with their beats.

One of the DJs enlisted in the ranks of the great music syndicate known as the Awesomenauts is called Rocco. He was once a rising star in The Intergalactic Symphonic Orchestra, but was ousted by a concertmaster who would not tollerate Rocco's ruthless freestyle jammin'. Refusing the back down and drop his aspirations of becoming a great musician, Rocco instead opted to drop the beat and joined the Awesomenauts, who welcomed him with open arms.

Electronic Supersonic Cybertronic Rocco is now one of the most prominent DJs in the galaxy, and uses his music to bring peace to worlds ruled by dissonance.

This DLC contains a custom skin for Rocco in Awesomenauts. The Electronic Supersonic Cybertronic skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for his abilities.

If you have not already unlocked the character, purchasing this DLC will do so.
