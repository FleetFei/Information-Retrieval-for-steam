							About This Game
							MISSING is an episodic series bringing the 90's FMV games and classic adventure together in a unique experience. In the first episode you play David Newcastle, the victim. Kidnapped for no clear reason, Dave will have to find his way out and elude captivity while trying to figure out who his captor is. Meanwhile, Detective Lambert investigates a series of mysterious disappearances in the city. Use your brain to solve puzzles, find items and use reflexes in action sequences to help the characters progress in the story. 

This game includes episode one only.  Future episodes arenâ€™t available yet and will be sold separately.
