							Explore the alien landscape of N1M, an alien moon deemed forsaken by the aliens and the civilization that mysteriously died there. You are a clean-up agent, a mercenary from Earth on a mission to remove all evidence of an attempt to colonize the nightmarish ruins of a people long extinct in this action platforming adventure. 

Jump, shoot, phase, upgrade your gear, kill robots, face alien horrors and make things go boom all at the same time.
