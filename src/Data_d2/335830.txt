							About This Game
							In Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, you take control of the last remaining ships of a near-destroyed Aâ€™kari fleet, and must rebuild your forces as you battle through ancient, galactic battlefields towards a final showdown with the Orthani. Build your fleet of up to 5 ships (from a choice of any combination of 8 classes) and upgrade their weapons and attachments which give you new and improved skills to use in combat.  With hundreds of attachments to choose from, each class has many different possible loadouts.Traverse the galaxy one system at a time - each step of the way you will face unique story events, each of which has multiple outcomes that can change with each playthrough.  Choose whether or not you enter combat, flee or try to talk your way out of difficult situations - but don't think the same choice next time round will have the same outcome!All set within a beautifully designed universe with an eerily atmospheric soundtrack - Distant Star: Revenant Fleet is a game you'll be playing again and again...
