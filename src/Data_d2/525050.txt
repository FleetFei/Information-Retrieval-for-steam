							About This Game
							With weak memory and even weaker ankles, Ellie is ill suited to her job as a waitress, or anything else, as far as she can tell. When her parents decide to sell her childhood home, however, it seems her one chance to save it is to pursue an unlikely career in the only thing she's actually good at: Art. Will she succeed? And, if she does, will success alone give her what she is actually searching for? Features: Make friends to help Ellie grow into a more confident person; live as an island to hone her skills as finely as possible; or try to find some balance between the two.  Familiar leveling, buff, and debuff systems carefully balanced to engage long standing RPG enthusiasts.  For VN fans, play as a purely interactive novel style stat builder with a selection of fun minigames.  Built in guidebook for those who are new to either of the genres, or who just want to refine their game and play at their own pace.  Over a dozen possible endings each shed a more complete light over the life and times of Ellie and her friends.  New game and new game plus features allow you to customize your replay experience.  More than 15 stat boosting outfits.  Unlockable image gallery. Special Thanks:Kristen Archer, voice of "Ellie" in game and promotions.Mom and Dad, seriously, we love you both.
