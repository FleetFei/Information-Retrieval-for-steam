							We at WaveDNA respect the rapid and unstoppable flow of your creativity-- it’s what Liquid Rhythm is all about. But as smooth as Liquid Rhythm is, sometimes you want more than a keyboard and mouse to get the ideas in your head onto the screen. That’s why the wizards in development designed an elegant workflow to make music production with Liquid Rhythm even more tactile: Liquid Rhythm’s MIDI script for Ableton Push in User Mode.Using the existing Max For Live plugin for Ableton Live 9 and taking full advantage of the hands-on control made possible with Ableton Push, WaveDNA is proud to feature its most advanced MIDI script yet, providing control over many features in Liquid Rhythm. You can navigate over your arrangement, cut, copy, and paste regions, humanize notes, and produce and experiment with beats without ever touching a keyboard or mouse. However, the most powerful (and fun!) control is this: The Push’s grid of colour RGB pads can be used to sequence Liquid Rhythm’s colour-coded note clusters.
