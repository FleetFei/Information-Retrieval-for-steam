							About This Game
							Gravilon is an inventive, thought-provoking puzzle platformer.  Use powerups in each environment, and your own inherent gravity-bending powers, to complete each level.  The levels and game mechanics are designed to encourage exploration and to allow for creative pathfinding â€” there is no one correct path for most levels, there is only (arguably) the fastest, most efficient route.Gravilon's story unfolds in the background. The level design builds on itself so that the more you play, the more you will learn about your role in the world.
