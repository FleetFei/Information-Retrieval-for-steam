							In a war-torn country that is plagued by a vicious dragon, Elenn, an arrogant, young noblewoman, accompanies her aunt on a mission to bring an ancient relic to the secret coronation of the rightful king. When her aunt is murdered on the road by enemy troops, Elenn must take her aunt's place at the coronation so she hires a smuggler, Aedin, to escort her across the volatile country. Corvus, a rogue magister of the empire has his own evil designs for the relic, and Elenn must find within herself the strength and humility to fulfill her aunt's calling to free the people, and become the Paladin--the long foretold dragon slayer.
