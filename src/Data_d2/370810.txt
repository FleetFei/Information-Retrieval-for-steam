							Being the only game of its kind, the all encompassing Universal Combat game is in need of a makeover, and the sales of this DLC will hopefully make that happen.Due to the massive scope of the game, we decided to improve on the game via DLC releases. This means more frequent updates in the months to come.  For example, this first DLC, contains no new gameplay features. It focuses purely on bug fixes, tweaks, as well as UI, engine, art and visual improvements. If successful, we plan future DLC which may include multiplayer (like the original 2004 game), new features, content etc. More info on the website.PLANNED FEATURESOn-going bug fixes and improvements via the 3.x game kernelOver 70 additional scenarios from the full gameThe Lyrius Conflict, a 16 mission campaign scenario based on the conflict that led to the events in the Line Of Defense gameUpdated graphics engine (SM 3.0 graphics card required)Updated planetary terrain engine, including new texture and mesh assetsNew character animation engineNew shader and special FX assets based on the improved graphics enginesImprovements to the AI engineImprovements to the audio engineImprovements to the UINew first person interfaceNew planetary terrain mission zones, and bases, with all-new assets, layout etcNew art assets for all NPC crew and key characters (officers, pilots, crew etc)New model assets for all game objects.

Ground vehicles and naval assets donâ€™t need these since they use the first person UIFull version of the Game Builder System (GBS) for user created mission script content. NOTE: This will be released in the months following the official release of the DLC.SUPPORTThere are no more updates to the base game. The final version was v2.00.03 released on 05-28-2015. You can view the changelog for more info. Due to the game being improved upon, future updates are only released via The Lyrius Conflict DLC which uses v3.x game engine kernel.
