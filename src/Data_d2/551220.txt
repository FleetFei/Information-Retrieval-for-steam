							About This Series
							Expected to spend his retired years living quietly outside Santa Fe, NM, former President Richard Graves spins out into an existential crisis when he realizes that his White House’s policies of 25 years ago have messed the country up and decides to go on a journey to right his administration’s wrongs. Graves befriends bohemian waitress Sammy and drags his uptight new assistant Isaiah along as he goes off the grid and tries for the first time in his life to live in the present moment and be authentic. Meanwhile, Olivia Graves is having a breakdown of her own, shedding her picture perfect First Daughter persona after separating from her Rockefeller husband, as her mother — the ever-composed Margaret Graves — tries to keep her family’s antics from drawing attention.
