							About This Game
							Hippocampal is a satiric contemplative game. 
- Satiric because we are mocking the hero, game characters, movies, comic books and video games we liked. And also the ones you like. Basically everything that tells you to be what you do not want to be.
- Contemplative because you just have to walk through this world to understand how it works.
 
Story 
You are an astronaut (M.kurt.C) taking some time off in orbit, enjoying your holidays, when suddenly from out of nowhere monsters crash into you and send you back to earthâ€¦
What are you going to do? Take revenge for this cosmic attack? Find ways to keep relaxing? Prevent those creatures from attacking earth? It all depends on the trauma of the crash, right?
