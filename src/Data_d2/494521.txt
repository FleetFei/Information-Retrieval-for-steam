							McDonnell Aircraft's F3H Demon™ was the firm's first swept-wing jet fighter. The aircraft was conceived in 1949 as the XF3H-1™, with the first flight taking place in 1951. Unfortunately, the original power plant proved unsatisfactory, though despite this the F3H-1N™ set an unofficial time-to-climb record in 1955 of 10,000 feet in 71 seconds! In 1953, the Demon™ was refitted with the more powerful and reliable Allison J71 engine. This new engine substantially boosted the aircraft’s performance. In 1956, the F3H-2N Demon™ was approved as a front line fighter with the U.S. Navy. In service, the Demon performed well, although it was still somewhat underpowered. It was a sturdy, stable platform under all flying conditions. The last of 522 Demons were delivered in 1959 and were not retired until 1964.The FSX: Steam Edition of the McDonnell F3H-2 Demon, developed by Virtavia, is a faithfully replicated aircraft add-on with four different payload versions, various animations, and smoke trail effects.
