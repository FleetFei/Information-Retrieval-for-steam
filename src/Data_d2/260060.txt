							About This Game
							Were you a teen in the late 90s? If you didn't play HeadRush back then, now’s the perfect time! Tons of trivia about the teen-y topics of the day await your now-aging brain and fingers!

Forget everything you know about a YOU DON’T KNOW JACK game because YDKJ’s horribly deformed, mutant offspring HEADRUSH has been birthed! Twisted animation, insane question types, and a bizarre appetite for all human excretory fluids and gassed add up to the most over-the-top YDKJ game ever! Fire this game up and stand back, because this is not your Mommy and Daddy’s YOU DON’T KNOW JACK!
