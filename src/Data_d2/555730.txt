							About This Game
							Robot City Stadium is a competitive multiplayer disc-combat sport focused on skill, nuance, and mastery.Competitive: Online multiplayer against friends, enemies, strangers, casual acquaintances, romantic interests, and even people from elementary school who for some reason just sent you a Steam friend request!Natural: You'll jump and dodge, block and throw, score points, and annihilate your friends with the natural effortlessness of "being there".  No obscure or uncomfortable teleport mechanics here- RCS was built from the ground up to take full advantage of room-scale VR.Finessed: RCS is a competitive game, so when you throw your weapon it has to go exactly where you expect, just like throwing a frisbee.  That's different than "goes where you want"- there's no aim-assist here.  The precision of the amazing Vive controllers means that what you throw is what you get.  It's up to you to bring the skill.Nuanced: Twist your wrist as you release a throw to add some spin for curving trick shots.  Collect and expend "spark energy" to give it an in-flight nudge and edge past a barrier or sneak in a hit out of left field.Varied: A selection of unique arena layouts and features keeps the action fresh and interesting.Not-really-all-that-intimidating: Experienced players are going to beat inexperienced players: that's just the nature of a skill-based game.  Fortunately, we've got friendly AI bots who are happy to train you without the attitudes and platitudes :) :)
