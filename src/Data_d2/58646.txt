							‘’CONQUEST’’ for Wargame: European Escalation brings brand new exciting content to extend the conflict.

Defy commanders worldwide in the brand new multiplayer mode: CONQUEST. To be victorious in this mode, in addition to the classic Command Points, you will have to control Victory Sectors (VS) located on the map, until the victory conditions are fully satisfied. In this mode there’s no Scoring System related to the destruction of your adversary’s units, only controlling territories will grant you victory. 7 maps have been adapted or created to fit this new mode, where you can either challenge players or AI.
 
In addition to this new game mode, 2 brand new maps have been added for the SIEGE mode, and an exclusive one has been created for DESTRUCTION and CONQUEST: Mecklenburg.
