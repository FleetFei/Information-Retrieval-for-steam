							Clementine Valley used to be the place to be! It was world renowned for its fantastic fruit trees lovingly tended to by Old Jim.  Unfortunately Jim has lost the energy to grow enough fruit to keep the locals happy, let alone attract the tourists Clementine Valley used to have.  Luckily for Jim, Flora’s kind gesture showed him that she has the spirit to continue his legacy and he gives her his Magic Gardening gloves...					It’s up to Flora to restore life to Clementine Valley by growing fruit with her magic gardening gloves!					Create a blossoming fruit farm empire in this tree growing, time and resource management game. 					Use your magic gloves to grow 50 different fruit trees in 8 unique environments.
