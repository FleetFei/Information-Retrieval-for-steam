							About This Game
							Classic, old-school point and click adventure!

With well over a hundred items, 80+ rooms and dozens of characters, you are in for one EPIC adventure! 

Original soundtrack with 13 beautiful tracks! 

A dark romantic comedy the likes of which you’ve never seen! 

Not a Hidden Object Game. 

When the lustful wizard “Wizardo” locks the Princess away in his magic castle, only one awkward villager is brave and stupid enough to intervene! YOU: Nubbin Pureheart, full of romantic feelings and yearnings must navigate this trap laden castle, defeat a wild menagerie of monsters and rescue the one true love of your life, the lovely Princess Myrna Loo. 

Here’s the plan: Get the wizard to think you’re applying for an apprenticeship and you’ll have full run of the castle while he fiddles with his evil scheme. Now all you have to do is solve the mysteries of the ancient ruins, resolve an underwater love triangle, rescue the Unicorn (or Harpy) from that macho, Latin bull and unlock a dozen or so doors! And this is all before your side quest to to meet the wizard’s flamboyant brother-in-law! 

Make friends and avoid being eaten by the colorful cast of CastleAbra! Greaser squids, punk flies and goth ravens are just some of the jerks you’ll have to put up with! You’ll also encounter drunken gnomes, heart-broken turtles, and lonely pirates! Who you help and who you betray will all play a part in getting you closer to your goal; a romantic date with that pretty Princess.
