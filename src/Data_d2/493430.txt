Organic chemistry concepts are sometimes difficult to understand when you're looking at a 2 dimensional representation of a 3 dimensional molecular structure. 

Are you ready to build with organic molecules such as Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Hydrogen? 

Design from the bottom up using more atoms than an chemical modeling kit. Designing with the source-code of matter is not just for scientists. Imagine if instead of bricks from Minecraft, anyone could select elements from the periodic table to create complex molecular structures.

Our goal is to provide the tools necessary to help people build new proteins, molecules and eventually also simulate their interactions. We are working on linking nano-one with complementary molecular modeling and simulation software that would allow for the geometries you created to be saved and exported to other programs that could import them as coordinates. (This is to be released in a later version).

The system is being designed in partnership with the University of California, San Diego.
