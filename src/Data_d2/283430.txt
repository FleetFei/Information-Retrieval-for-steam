							About This Game
							Welcome to the Underworld, where you guide Mutt, the bad luck Litil Divil, through the Labyrinth of Chaos to retrieve the Mystical Pizza of Plenty. Our “hero” takes a fateful step through the Mortal Portal to prowl five hellish levels of treacherous tunnels with more than 50 raucous rooms of gameplay. Beware of killer spiders, bottomless swamps, ferocious furnaces... and crazed bartenders. And watch out! If you can't get Mutt to the Overlord, The Entity and The Servant will drag him to the Torture Room for a little fiendish fun.
