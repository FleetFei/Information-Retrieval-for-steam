							About This Game
							From the artists behind the smash hit Towerfall comes the critically-acclaimed Out There Somewhere.  Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid, you play as an astronaut stranded on a strange and dangerous alien planet.  Low on fuel, your only hope for escape is to make your way to the planet’s core.It will take brains and quick reflexes to survive in this incredibly clever action platformer.“Out There Somewhere isn't a normal game, though: it's a platformer with a devious twist and a truly shocking difficulty curve. It's a platformer with a very late level, for example, that contains absolutely no platforms at all - just empty space and a doorway right near the ceiling. This is challenging stuff, but it's wonderfully creative with it, and I'm not sure I can recommend it enough.”  -Eurogamer 9/10
