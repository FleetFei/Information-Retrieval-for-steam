							About This Game
							All starts from a love tragedy.
A man lost his wife many years ago.
Every anniversary of her past, he stood at her grave and wept.
But this year, he made a dream.
He dreamt about her, but she looks like another woman.
So as he, also became another man.
Her calling around his ears.
Following the sound, he started tracing his wife,
no matter all kind of fear, injury, and death.
With courage and wisdom, he kept marching inside the endless samsara, until he found the path out of the nightmare.
这是一段悲伤地情感故事
他很多年前失去了他的妻子
每年到她离开的那一天，他都会去看她
他在她的坟前做了一场梦
梦见了她和另一个她
而自己也变成了另一个人
他能听到她的呼唤
于是他不断的在这里寻找他的妻子
经历着各种恐惧、伤害、死亡
依靠自己的勇气和智谋
一遍又一遍的轮回
直到，从这梦境中走出
