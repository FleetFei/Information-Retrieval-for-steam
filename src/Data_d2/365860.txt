							About This Game
							You don't need to have played the first Spaceman Sparkles game (it's terrible anyway) I'm pretty much just counting so I'll reach Sparkles 64 one day!Spaceman Sparkles 2 is a frantic and groovy bullet-hell that takes place in a thumpin' disco universe. Calm your nerves with the sick beats by Aeroloid (and a chippy guest track by Death M.D.) in this painfully difficult shooter, you'll be begging for mercy while bobbing your head to the beat. Equipped with a rave gun, teleportation boots and giant hammers, you'll lead Sparkles through space and time to defeat mysterious beings of light, collect the 24 glowsticks of legend and retrieve his stolen throne in this grueling adventure."You'll never shine if you don't glow." - Typo"스트레스 받기에 딱 좋은 게임입니다." - User review.
