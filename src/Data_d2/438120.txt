							About This Game
							A child reaches for the stars, burdened by circumstance. Folks chained by debt, indentured to the powers at large. Mankind thrust to the stars following after a signal spanning the void of space and time itself. Take a seat and settle into the universe of Ira where the space age coincides with the 1930's depression era.
