At its core is a story exploration path free from puzzles where you can unfold the story at your own pace.There is also a deeper, more adventurous path in which you can complete complex puzzles to restore life changing events of the patients history in order to help the validation of their life.Parallel paths make Ether One accessible to a range of skilled players.
