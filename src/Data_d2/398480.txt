							INFO: Microphone required to fully play the game, Oculus Rift is fully optionalYour cat Louie is one of a kind: He wants to become a marmalade-cook and expects your help protecting his fruity ingredients from the onmarching waves of enemies, called cuties! Each type of cutie has their own weakness which you need to make us of! Shake your head, stare at them, sing/whistle or make a loud noise to keep Louie cooking! We also feature complete Oculus Rift compatibility for your adventure! Try to break through multiple waves and score cat-triple points with huge combo-chains! The "Quick Game"-mode allows you to fully customize your experience: Choosing the cuties that appear or the stage to play in!
