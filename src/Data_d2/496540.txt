							About This Game
							Zone of Lacryma is a story driven 2D shooter inspired by the classic shmups but with a couple of twists. You will be flying through custom built levels, trying to get a new highscore or the fastest time possible. Multiple weapons that behave differently give room for different ways to play. A charge system that lets you balance how offensive or defensive you want to be. An upgrade system that customizes your ship even further. And a deep and rich story that leads you through your missions, giving everything purpose.
