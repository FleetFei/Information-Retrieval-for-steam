							About This Game
							No one is forced to join a cult. It welcomes you. It understands you. It envelops you until the words become more than truth - they make you whole.

In the late 1970s, the charismatic Isaac and Rebecca Walker lead the Collective Justice Mission.  Labeled radicals and feeling persecuted by the US government, they relocate their followers to the one place they believe they can create a socialist utopia:  the jungles of South America.  There they build Freedom Town. But relatives left behind in the US become worried:  what exactly is going on at this compound in the jungle?  

The Church in the Darkness combines unique narrative with tight top-down action-infiltration gameplay in an open-ended environment.  As Vic, an ex-law enforcement officer, you travel to South America to get into Freedom Town and check on your nephew, Alex.  Play how you want - you can avoid detection completely, take on the guards using non-lethal methods, or kill anyone who gets in your way.  But you'll have to live with the consequences of those choices.  

The game stars Ellen McLain (best known as GLaDOS in Portal) and John Patrick Lowrie (the Sniper from Team Fortress 2) as the intense Rebecca and Isaac Walker.  You soak up the story through the town PA system, where the preachers share their dogma and beliefs.  You find documents and letters scattered around camp which clue you into the true nature of Freedom Town.

Every playthrough offers unique gameplay scenarios and story elements, with different character personalities and a shifting narrative told through investigation and action. How dangerous are the Walkers? Who are your allies and enemies? How far will you go to uncover the truth and save these people?
