							About This Game
							In "The Space Garden" you can build your own garden across the Universe! 
Discover, acquire and grow your plants with love as you watch them evolve. 

Collect fruits by yourself or request help from your "helpers", a race of mini friends who come from nature. 

Discover new options and get more experience to unlock new in-game features. 

But take care! The space is a huge and dangerous thing. Your garden might need 
protection from aliens and other hazards which will steal/destroy your fruits. 

Unlock items, increase your experience as a farmer and enjoy special 
events across the game all the time! 

Make it grow, give it love and expand the garden to the infinite.
