							~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My name is Jack. I do not know my real surname. Tween is the one which i was given. Probably not by my parents. It is said that everyone has his own story to tell. But this is just a half true.  We are so concentrated on ourselves that we forget about the other stories. Those that has been written from a wider perspective. Where our story takes just one act. Where we play just one role. Sometimes not major one. In real life every story is connected to another and you can not say that one is more important |than the other. I have played my role as good as i could but i know that without some other actors i would have never wrote this note. I will try to tell you my story and i will   use all my empathy to make sure that you know, my story here is not the most important one.Maybe we should start here. At old manor. Some people call it devil house or doll house. You could call it as you like later. For now let it be just an old manor.Jack~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Welcome to old manor.
