							Repulse was a Renown-class battlecruiser and participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. After the end of World War I, she and Renown were both reconstructed, receiving additional hangars, aircraft equipment and air defense artillery. In early World War II, Repulse served in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. She participated in the search for the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941. Later, she was assigned to Force Z which was supposed to deter Japanese aggression against British interests in the Far East. Repulse and her consort Prince of Wales were eventually sunk by Japanese aircraft in December 1941 when they attempted to intercept landings.
