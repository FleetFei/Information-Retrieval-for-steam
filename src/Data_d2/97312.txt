							Sarkhan Vol’s fully unlocked “Dragon’s Roar” red-black deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Sarkhan Vol’s specialty is draconic shamanism: spells that summon dragons and evoke the rage and passion of dragonkind. Start the onslaught with goblin underlings on the first turn and don’t let up until mighty dragons engulf the skies overhead. And if any dare stand against you, you’ll have a host of red and black removal spells to ensure they don’t stand for very long.
