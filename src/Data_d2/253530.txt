							About This Game
							Fortress Forever is a Source mod inspired by the earlier versions of the Team Fortress series (Team Fortress Classic and QuakeWorld Team Fortress). Our all-volunteer team has created this mod entirely from scratch and continued to develop it since late 2004. It was originally released in September of 2007.Fortress Forever involves two or more teams, each with 9 available classes, competing in a variety of map-determined objectives (capture the flag, territorial control, invade and defend, etc). Each class has its own unique abilities and strengths that offer extremely varied playstyles. The gameplay ranges from fast-paced, competitive, and deep to absurd and chaotic.Totally freeFast paced, team- and class-based gameplayFaithful to the spirit of Team Fortress Classic (TFC) and QuakeWorld Team Fortress (QWTF), meaning Fortress Forever includes offhand grenades, bunnyhopping, etc10 Classes (9 + Civilian)Training level and in-game hintsExtensive map scripting/customization using LuaFAQQ: How is this related to Team Fortress 2?A: It isn't at all. Fortress Forever was in development before the current incarnation of Team Fortress 2 was announced and was released before TF2. The gameplay and goals of each are vastly different and are hard to compare directly. Fortress Forever is far more similar to Team Fortress Classic and QuakeWorld Team Fortress than it is to Team Fortress 2.
