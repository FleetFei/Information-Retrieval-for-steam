							Melissa lives an ideal life with her son Noah, but she's no ordinary mom. She was once one of the most sought-after cat burglars in the world. She's given up her life of crime and after living for years under a false identity, she took a trip to her hometown with her son. She thought it was safe. Things go wrong when Noah goes missing at the airport; Melissa's only clue is a phone call with a demand. It's been a long time but now she has one last job. With the help of her old friend Mouse, Melissa must find her son, his kidnapper and avoid the police radar. And she's going to have to crack a few safes along the way.
