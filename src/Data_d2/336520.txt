							About This Game
							In the world of Might and Magic no hero is more powerful than their army, no weapon is mightier than a keen strategic mind, and no enemy is too difficult to overcome for heroes who join forces.

Might & Magic® Heroes Online (MMHO) is a free-to-play MMO strategy RPG game in which you control powerful Heroes and their armies as they do battle throughout the fantasy world of Ashan.
Join a faction, chose your hero and select your favorite path: become an impregnable bulwark or a powerful mage with access to very old and destructive spells. But it is a long way to go and you have to deserve your hero reputation first before facing the wreckful evil in the final battle. During your journey through that handcrafted universe, you will solve a huge amount of exciting quests; you will fight dozens of fantastic creatures, you will raise and upgrade your personal army and you will command and run your own towns. Enjoy the deep and fascinating turn-based battle system, alone or with the brand-new cooperative mode – any battle in MMHO is playable with a friend! But there is much more to explore: find and complete powerful artefacts, enter with a group of people special raid provinces or compare your power and skill in duels with other players. One of the biggest, deepest and most colorful games ever made in the Might & Magic universe.
