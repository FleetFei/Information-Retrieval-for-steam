							The Insurgency Pack delivers additional content for the Deniable Ops mode that can be played solo or co-operatively. Hunt down the remaining Black Arrow insurgents across new locations in San Francisco, a New Orleans cemetery, a Portland Prison and a hidden research complex in Salt Lake City. The threat is not over; Black Arrow is still out there â€“ watching.
