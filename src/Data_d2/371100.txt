							About This Game
							Waste WalkersIt is perhaps a decade into our future... Mankind's future. The economies of the world have imploded. Governments have waged war on both their neighbors and their own citizens. There has been a complete collapse of society, order, infrastructure, and morality.  Horrific weapons have scarred the earth and vaporized entire cities. Those who have not yet perished are forced to scavenge and struggle for survival. This is their new reality. Hordes of disfigured creatures hunt for food. Gangs of bandits rob, kill, and loot. You are but a dim flicker of light in a dark and dying world. This is the world of Waste Walkers.Features:Character Creation, Customization, & ProgressionSkill SystemDynamic & Compelling Main StoryOpen WorldHuge City Map With Miles Of Land To Traverse & Over 120 Interior Areas To Enter & Explore Including A Metro System Under The City Which Is Almost As Large As The City ItselfSemi-Randomly Generated GameplayChilling & Unique AtmosphereDiverse & Realistic CharactersRealistic Hunger & Thirst SystemFace Constant & Ever Evolving ChallengesBackground Story & Fictional LoreDecision SystemOpen Class SystemPlayer-Managed Colony SystemArena Mini GameRandomized AmbushesField Of View SystemRandomized Music & Environmental AmbianceForaging, Hunting, Crafting & ScavengingLight & Easy To Use Crafting SystemRealistic Scavenging SystemTotally Randomized Loot SystemBeautifully Crafted EnvironmentsAmazing SoundtrackStunning Sound EffectsDozens of Different Enemies Including Mutants, Bandits, Wild Animals, & MoreOpen EnvironmentsExcellent Combat SystemFull Mouse & Keyboard SupportOver 50 Side QuestsRandom EventsDay/Night CycleRandomized Weather PatternsHundreds Of Choices For EquipmentFully Equippable CharactersCountless Hours Of GameplayLarge Amount Of Steam Achievements For Achievement Hunters & CompletionistsEndless Replayability
