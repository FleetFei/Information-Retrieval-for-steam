					Briton Archers — Facing constant warfare, the Britons realized that they need some archers who are trained in the art of melee. 
					
					
					
					Briton Cavalry — These devoted horsemen ride out into the hidden corners of Britannia to bring back rumors. In battles their heavy armor gives them excellent protection, but also slows them down a bit.
