							About This Game
							Try your hand at the VR spaceflight challenge reviewers have dubbed “not a hurl fest!” Enter a world full of immersive alien landscapes through which you must navigate at high speeds, using lightning-fast reflexes to score points and earn your rep as the ultimate starfighter pilot. How long can you survive? PolyRunner VR is an addictive, high-quality experience that tests your skills against an other-worldly, ever-changing landscape rather than testing your ability to maintain control of your stomach. This engaging virtual world offers more interesting, challenging terrain the further you progress. All the while, you can collect bonus points for your precision by navigating through checkpoints and utilizing boosts to give you an extra edge. The intuitive controls make it easy for anyone to compete in this spaceship runner, but mastering flight skills is a feat that will earn you a place among the top guns and make you worthy of a personal theme song that would inspire jealousy in any maverick pilot.
