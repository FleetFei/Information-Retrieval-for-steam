							Mech Skeleton features a unique, high immersion locomotion system.As a Mech Skeleton Pilot you decide the most effective tactic for each combat situation.Attack the enemy head on, or be stealth waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike!!The Mech Skeleton program was born out of desperate times.In the beginning millions of lives were lost, allied soldiers were simply slaughtered by the seemly unstoppable PNA Death Droids.It was a stroke of luck, or pure chance while operating in total darkness that we were able to build a weapon capable of pushing the PNA filth back into the dirt.Using intel gained from a captured PNA scientist, the first Mech Skeleton was activated.Our soldiers finally had the super human abilities needed to rise up against the enemy.Initially the program was considered a great success, with the PNA crippled Mech Skeleton pilots were feared on the battlefield.Until recently, when things changed.Allied forces have been trying to pass off the recent strange behaviour as a small glitch in the system, nothing to worry about.However this is no glitch.The Mech Skeleton program and the technology driving must not be trusted.Features: Virtual Reality Shooter    Unique high immersion locomotion system, swing your arms to move about the world Hide and Seek Stealth  Run and Gun Action  Primary and Secondary Weapon types    Multiple enemy types
