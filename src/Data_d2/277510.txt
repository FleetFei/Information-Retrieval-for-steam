							Shiny the Firefly is a challenging platformer, set in an atmospheric , delightful environment .  Control Shiny, a brave firefly, on a quest to find his children who have been scattered all over the mysterious garden, following a terrible accident. Master tricky trials and solve demanding puzzles on this odyssey. You’ll need stealth to protect your children from deadly dangers and to fend off nasty enemies. As well as big boss fights, you’ll encounter many dangerous garden dwellers, such as the stubborn mosquitoes, hungry toads, mischievous plants, sneaky wasps and endlessly long centipedes.
This colourful, gorgeous world is  a feast for the eye. Thanks to the great animation you’ll know how Shiny’s feeling at every twist and turn- if he is happy, frightened, tired or angry. This will help you to solve even the toughest of challenges.  Remember to use Shiny's glow skilfully; only when he is lit up can his children will follow him, but beware, for this makes him easier prey for his enemies…
Direct gamepad controls, Steam Achievements and Trading Cards top off the whole thing - resulting in a great overall package. Can you reunite Shiny with his family?
