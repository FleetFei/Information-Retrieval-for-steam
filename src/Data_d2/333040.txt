							No matter how many hours of Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes you’ve played, the Battlegrounds DLC will present you with new frontiers to conquer. 

Fifteen hand-crafted tactical battle maps, from a ruined Imperial highway to a forgotten fortress deep in the desert sands, are full of new challenges for your armies. You’ll need new tactics for starting out surrounding or encircled by your enemies, or faced with the need to defend or assault tight chokepoints. 

The Battlegrounds DLC pack also enhances replayability with the inclusion of 20+ stamps that give the random map generator new tools to create limitless variety. The worlds waiting for you to make your mark upon them have never been so diverse.
