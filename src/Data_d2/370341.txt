							The only proof of this beast's existence is the trail of dismembered bodies it leaves in its wake. The few who claim to have seen it speak of a monstrous tiger shark that strikes without warning and then disappears into the darkness. Locals have named it the "Reef Stalker" after its favored hunting grounds.
