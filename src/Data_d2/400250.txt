							About This Game
							Heaven Island is an experiential game in which you'll explore wonderful environments and places.

On this Island, time and space are frozen and you'll be able to visit it and at the same time explore the inner of your soul.
All problems and worries of life will be left far behind so that you'll be able to rest your soul and mind during this experience.


The inspiration for the environments comes from the Renzo Piano designs and from the book "Origins of Architectural Pleasure" in which the player's welfare is of primary importance.

This game is a Massive Multiplayer Online experience in the sense that you'll be able to connect with all other gamers and will be able to view their essence in order to be able to create a "Connection". 

All the details you see on the Island are made by hand, every rock you see is put there with a purpose.

We really hope you'll enjoy this wonderful experience.
