							About This Game
							The Preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is a satirical point-and-click adventure game, about progress, politics and propulsive nozzles. It features a traditional verb-based interface, with updated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for'), unique collage-based art and ~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigans. The preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is about an apparently primitive society, attempting to work together to build a space rocket. It follows these people, from disordered chaos (the past), through a disgusting and distorted and horrible and hilarious kind of faux-democracy (the present (SATIRE! Amirite?!?!)), into the unknowable, irrelevant emptiness of outer space (the future).Along the journey players will encounter a host of colourful characters (including the mysterious Man with the Little Pencil, the superfluous Man in the Wren Suit and the fabulous Helen), they will solve a variety of engaging puzzles, and they will be forced into making a number of difficult moral decisions, with potential disastrous consequences!Features:Traditional verb-based interfaceUpdated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for')Unique collage-based artA cameo appearance from Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie) ~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigansA joke about white blood cellsProhibitively experimental electronic musicIrrelevant duck
