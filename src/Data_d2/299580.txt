							About This Game
							Abducted by aliens and taken thousands of light years from home, you have one ultimate goal: Escape. But you have so many unanswered questions… How did you get here? What is this place? Who took you and why?

There are a few things you learn right away. You’re clearly somewhere in deep space, one look at the starfield and asteroids drifting by outside the window makes that pretty clear. And then there’s this device implanted in your arm, how did it get there? Who put it there? You can have conversations with it, explore its functionality, it can even help you fight hostile aliens and control the environment.

If you want to survive and get away from this place, you’ll have to solve these mysteries and others.
