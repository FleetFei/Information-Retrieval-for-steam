							About This Video
							THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT follows a trio of filmmakers on what should have been a simple walk in the woods but quickly becomes an excursion into heart-stopping terror. As the three become inexplicably lost, morale deteriorates. Hunger sets in. Accusations fly. As the end of their journey approaches, they realize that what they are filming now is not a legend...but their own descent into unimaginable horror.
