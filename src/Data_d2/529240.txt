							Creature Clicker is a new take on the Clicker genre, taking inspiration from Clicker Heroes and Pokemon it builds on both elements, you can capture creatures, level them up to make them do more DPS and ascend them to gain better abilities. You start the game by selecting an egg and incubating it by killing enemies, everytime you kill an enemy you have a 1 / 10 chance of capturing it and having it as a pet that will do constant DPS to enemies so you have help clicking As you creatures grow up they will get tougher and you will be able to use your hard earned cash to purchase upgrades and abilities, each pet has a "Right Click" ability which can be purchased when the creature reaches it's final ascension You will also be able to pickup rare items from creatures which can be equipped on your creatures to further boost your DPS and beat those high level bosses which appear every 15 levels and must be beaten within 30 seconds or you will not be able to progress to the higher levels until they are beat, this will sometimes mean going back a few levels to further level your creatures and then come back and beat them when you are bigger and stronger!
