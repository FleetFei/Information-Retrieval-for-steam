							Tamns wagons are used to transport moisture-sensitive loose materials such as plaster, salt or coke and to move heavy freight such as metal loads. The wagons feature a cover which can be rolled along the wagon top to keep rain off the load. All vehicles use programmed train back plates at each end of the wagon.

The wagons in this pack feature the virtualRailroads RandomSkin system. When placing the wagons in scenarios, RandomSkin automatically and randomly selects one of four livery variations to give your consists a realistic unsorted appearance.
