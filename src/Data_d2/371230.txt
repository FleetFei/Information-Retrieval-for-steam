							Company man Henry Wood (Eddie Jemison) is in for the shock of his lifetime when a normal day at the office is hijacked by a sadistic killer. Top management has gathered at headquarters to await an offer of acquisition that will make them each rich beyond their dreams, but the day starts badly when the company’s president, Walt Ford (Oscar-nominee Robert Forster), is found hanging from a noose in the boardroom. When management elects to ignore the suicide until their deal has closed, the decision sends the entire office into a death spiral of finger pointing, deal-making, prophetic PowerPoint presentations, and gruesome murders. Teamed with a seductive temp (Noureen DeWulf) and a bumbling group of co-workers that make the cast of The Office look tame, Henry must find the killer before the killer finds him… Or the next blood-soaked pink slip will be his own.With an all-star cast that also includes Richard Riehle and the hilarious Peter Breitmayer, all bets are off in this film festival favorite. An equal mix of Clue, Office Space, and Ghostbusters – Coffee, Kill Boss is a comedic-thriller for our times.Directed by: Nathan MarshallProduced by: Scott Van Dutton, Nathan Marshall, Rob Mello, Gregor HabsburgStarring: Eddie Jemison, Robert Forster, Noureen DeWulf, Peter Breitmayer, Richard Riehle, Zibby Allen
