							About This Game
							Survival roguelike novellas with meaningful choices and multiple endings! 

There are two scenarios currently: first one is set on a small island. It's 1926, you're 13 years old and it is raining. You're looking for your lost father. 

The second scenario puts you in the role of a mountaineer trying to climb an eight-thousander.

It's a coffee-break game, randomized every playthrough - especially if you like to die a lot during your coffee breaks.
