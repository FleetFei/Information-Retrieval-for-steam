							Do you know what happens after check-in? Do you think our luggage is safe in the conveyor belts of the airport? Now you can discover the truth!
Crazy Belts is a casual puzzle game that tells the amazing story of our bags, and why they end up in distant countries when we leave them in the belts. Join Loui the Bag in his trip across five countries: travel from London to Madrid, from the majestic Statue of Liberty in New York to the Great Wall of China… and help him and his friends to return home safe!

BECOME THE CARGO GUY!
Playing Crazy Belts is simple: you become the cargo guy and have to manage the belts, making every piece of luggage falling from above get to its correct destination. Colors will help you, and eventually you’ll get amazing superpowers to unlock. Easy-peasy? Well, don’t be so sure… When the action rushes on and mad gears and contraptions appear in the screen, you’re going to need all your expertise and best reflexes to prevent the bags from being lost forever. Hurry up before the plane leaves!
