							The heyday of Scottish steam from the 1960s is recreated in the Western Lines of Scotland route, now available for Train Simulator.The route features a collection of railway lines representing the journey from Carlisle to Stranraer, via Dumfries, just prior to the Beeching axe, which saw many of these lines disappear. From Carlisle to Gretna, travel the route of the old Caledonian Railway before joining the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway bound for Dumfries. At Dumfries, the line branches again and continues along the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway, and at Castle Douglas continues along the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railway to Stranraer. Numerous yards and sheds can also be seen along the route, including Kingmoor Yard, London Road Sidings, Longtown MoD, Gretna Junction, Dumfries Depot, and Stranraer Harbour.Western Lines of Scotland, developed by Keith Ross, also includes a re-worked BR Black 5 4-6-0, which comes in light, intermediate and heavy weathered variants, and an option for a front buffer beam mounted BR Type 06 snow plough on the locomotive. There are also accurate headcode options to correctly represent the rolling stock being hauled, and realistic and HUD driving modes.The route includes scenarios featuring the Black 5 and the branch line to Kirkcudbright, making the Western Lines of Scotland a must for steam fans and those looking to recreate the pre-Beeching days.Scenarios15 scenarios for the Western Lines of Scotland route, featuring the Black 5:Ayr LineBe PreparedBorder HopBorder RaiderCoals to CarlisleDefensive MovesFishing TripIce Cream Man Part 1Ice Cream Man Part 2Ice Cream Man Part 3Milk and CookiesOil See You LaterSolway TraderSunset ShiftThames Clyde ExpressMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
