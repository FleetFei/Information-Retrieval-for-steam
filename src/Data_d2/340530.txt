							Soccer Legends brings the excitement of Tactical-RPG's to the world of football. Managing a team, controlling it in the spectacular turn-based matches where taking the initiative and selecting the best strategy is the only way to glory.

Soccer Legends takes the best facets of board games and blends with gorgeous animation sequences with the soul of 90’s anime series, offering something truly new.

At its core, players can build the team from the scratch, taking decisions, forming the squad, managing resources and buildings, improving squad members… In a few words, allowing it to get a single game experience for each player.

That is the universe of Soccer Legends.
