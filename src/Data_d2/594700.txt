							Welcome to the Streets of Rogue. The Mayor has banned all unofficially-sanctioned music and demanded the forfeiture of every non-compliant cassette tape and compact disc. All that has been saved is a collection of vintage dance music B-sides called "NOW That's What I Hope You Think Is Music," passed around furtively in the shadows by the Resistance. Treat your copy well, for it is all you have left.More music will be added to this soundtrack throughout development of Streets of Rogue.Once purchased, the soundtrack will be available in mp3 format in the 'Soundtrack' folder of the Streets of Rogue Steam directory.Streets of Rogue Soundtrack by Craig Barnes1.
