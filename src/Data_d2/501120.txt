							About This Game
							Clock Simulator is a minimalistic rhythm game. It puts the player in the role of the clock itself to explore the concept of time in a whole new way and offer challenge, relaxation, or plain and simple fun. All that a clock needs to do is to advance precisely once every second. Second, after second, after second, after secondâ€¦ Sounds simple enough? But could YOU take over and do it? Calm down. Relax. Focus on your inner rhythm. Click once a second. Every second. You are the clock.

- A unique concept of a clock-based rhythm game: you are the clock
- Controls so simple you could play with your eyes closed
- A variety of play modes and themes ranging from meditative to arcade
- Option to unlock modes and themes you enjoy to play them at your own leisure
