							PRESENTATIONLife's good when you're the Princess; no responsibilities, nobody telling you what to do or where to go, just running around, having fun and flitting your life away.So what happens when the fate of the world falls into the hands of the most irresponsible bubblehead to ever trip over royal birth?An ancient evil threatens to walk the land again, and only someone of royal blood can stop it from waking up. But the only royal available is a girl affectionately nicknamed Princess Ooh-Look-a-Kitty, for...fairly obvious reasons. Teamed with a flustered bodyguard, a dismissive soldier of fortune, and a lovestruck nomad, Princess Calliope has to navigate a world she barely understands to save the world. And if she's not careful, she might just grow up a little.
