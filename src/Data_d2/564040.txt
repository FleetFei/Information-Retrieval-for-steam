The small, but powerful ZanFighter is equipped with the super weapon ‘Warp Slash’, which makes it the only craft capable of surviving the myriad of traps in Benomiya’s fortress and countering the BEM menace.The battle begins: Earth’s most powerful combat craft against the galaxy's deadliest threat.Hyperdimensional Fighter Craft ‘ZanFighter’A space fighter craft developed by the Super-electric Research Center, home of the legendary giant robot Supercharged Robot VULKAISER.ZanFighter specializes in close combat and possesses a variety of special capabilities including ‘Warp Slash’ and ‘Dimensional Shockwave’. Its sophisticated and highly advanced automated systems allow its pilot to concentrate on maneuvering, firing the weapons, and effectively utilizing the warp functions listed below.Warp SlashThe Warp Slash is a more advanced version of the ‘Tokitome Warp’ used by the combat android ‘Meguriro’ during the Gogoh War of 1977. When activated, the warp effect stops time and transmits the ZanFighter almost instantaneously to the designated coordinates.   Warp transmission utilizes multiple dimensions, allowing the ZanFighter to pass through any type of physical matter, including enemy bullets and obstacles. At the same time, it inflicts slicing damage upon any enemies that lie in the path of the warp.Dimensional ShockwaveThis area-effect attack inflicts damage upon any enemies present at the warp destination upon completion of the warp. Both the ‘Dimensional Shockwave’ and ‘Warp Slash’ make use of the distortion in the fabric of space caused by warping.DecoyProjects a holographic image of the ZanFighter at the warp origin. The hologram acts as a decoy, distracting enemy visuals and sensors, and drawing their fire. Decoys will disappear after a set amount of time, but a new Decoy can be redeployed at the ZanFighter’s current position when the warp is engaged again.Magno-Electric ShieldA defensive shield that can protect the ZanFighter against one enemy attack. The shield activates when the shield energy reaches full charge. Shield energy charges automatically and also increases when enemy capsules are collected.Omega CrashTriggers when the Magno-electric Shield deactivates.
