							About This Game
							Explore a 1 to 4 player co-operative personality test set in a rich, ancient world that's different every time you play.

You have 5 days before King Mardokh and the Sun Cultists declare war on Issariaâ€™s tribes. Multiple playthroughs of this short story will let you see it from different angles and uncover new sides to characters, conflicts, and narratives. Try out all 4 player hometowns and 6 player character classes, each with their own abilities and randomly generated upgrades as you build your mythology.

Every action and choice you make contributes to your legend, as a constellation in the night sky. How will you be remembered?
