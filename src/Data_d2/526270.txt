							About This Game
							Adventurous Life VR is a game built for the HTC Vive. The game is meant to let players have fun with the immersive experience of virtual reality. We have embedded most elements that come with VR: mutliplayer, experiences of height, shooting, sword fights and archery.

The player finds himself on an island with a nice atmosphere. With more and more gaming experience, coins can be earned to buy armory for the multiplayer shooter.

Imagine the stunning feeling of standing on a floating stone in a hundred meters upward, looking down on the island, sourrounded by other moving and floating objects through which you have to find a way to succeed the Jumping Puzzles and unlock more adventures with extraordinary elements.
