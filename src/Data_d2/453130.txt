							Turn based strategy. Explosions. A diverse cast of gelatinous characters.Powargrid is a turn-based strategy game that plays like a board game... with explosions!Destroy your opponent's power plants and protect your own. Strike a balance between attacking, defending, and building your economy to control the board. Blast your opponent with shockwave towers or strike them from afar with the lightning cannon. Construct additional power plants to boost your power economy and extend your reach with substations. Is the situation looking exceedingly grim? Overcharge your power plants for a last ditch defense or a surprise attack! Serious strategy in a light-hearted setting Plan your moves carefully: as with any turn-based strategy game, make tactical decisions and work with the outcome Your leader knows best: Commander Grak knows it all and is not shy to share his thoughts. Hear him out, or dismiss him straight away and focus on the action Challenge all: demonstrate your skills in the campaign mode, multiplayer (online/hotseat/local) and skirmish battles Tinker with the AI: an API is provided that allows you to program the most fearsome opponents possible Achieve the impossible: we dare you to do the (almost) unachievable and collect a range of precious achievementsIn the story driven campaign, you will take on rival factions as a recruit in the Blue Blobbie army. Get shouted at by your lovable Commander Grak, face down Hero Archeologist Ford of the Red Blobbies, take on the mad green Zealot Zomg, and thwart the schemes of Chairman Swap of the Grand Yellow Blobbie Corporation. And rumors say that's not all...Powargrid also features online and hotseat multiplayer, and skirmish battles against computer opponents.
