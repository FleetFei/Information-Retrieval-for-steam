							There are many history books on legends, but none more legendary then the Nostradamacon!Never heard of the Nostradamacon you say?Well, many years ago there was an incident that nearly brought about a cataclysmic event that could end all time, it all began with a man gifted with the ability to predict the future, his name was Nostradamus. As many believed his abilities to be a gift, he felt it to only be a burden as he saw far beyond his own time and long before it but could do nothing to prevent anything from happening. Many of his predictions are now controversially famous for being as accurate as they are without any explanation to how he made them. Nostradamus kept his all his major predictions in a book and kept it locked away in the hopes that they would never come true nor fall into the wrong hands, this book was called the Nostradamacon.GameplayLegends of Time is currently a local split-screen multiplayer couch hack and slash where you cooperatively work with friends to take on waves of enemies with a handful of lives.
