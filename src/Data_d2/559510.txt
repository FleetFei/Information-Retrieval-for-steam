							3D packages can be a very effective tool in terms of creating thumbnail sketches for clients .

In this video I will be using maya to demonstrate how use basic primitives to create environments ( though you can use any program that you like that has some kind of lighting in it )

From there we will take those basic block outs and paint over them!

This lesson will come with 1 video hour of basic modeling in maya , 1 hour video showing how to paint over the 3D block out , and a 30 minute "sped up" video of myself painting over two blocks outs with no commentary.
