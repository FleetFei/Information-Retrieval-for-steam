							Universe Sandbox ² is a physics-based space simulator that allows you to create, destroy, and interact on an unimaginable scale.It merges real-time gravity, climate, collision, and material interactions to reveal the beauty of our universe and the fragility of our planet. Universe Sandbox ² is the long awaited sequel to the original Universe Sandbox.Universe Sandbox ² includes the desktop version and a new VR mode with support for the HTC Vive. This is a free, automatic update.Simulate GravityN-body simulation at almost any speed using Newtonian mechanics. Real science, real physics, no supercomputer required. Collide Planets & StarsEpic, mind blowing collisions of massive planetary bodies.Model Earth's ClimateWatch sea ice grow and recede with the seasons because of the tilt of the Earth: change the tilt and change the seasons. Or move the Earth farther from the Sun and freeze the entire planet. Learn more...Terraform PlanetsAdd carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere to heat it up. Then add water...Deform SurfacesImpact planets with asteroids and comets and leave behind massive, molten craters.Supernova a StarMake a star evolve by cranking up its age or mass, then watch a supernova unfold.And more...Material System - build planets out of Hydrogen, Iron, Rock, & WaterSolar flares & volatile trailsProcedurally generated stars & planetsPulsarsLight-warping black holesDark matter
