							Knights of Pen & Paper: Haunted Fall expands on the unmistakable charm and wit of the original game with more enemies, more epic quest and more locations in a spine tingling Halloween setting.Navigate an engrossing new quest line where you square off against unruly Jack o Lanterns, wobbly undead and a mish mash of bewildered monsters. Halloween will never be the same again! As both the playing characters AND the game master, players can choose which battles to fight. Put together a bunch of monsters to make for a challenging fight and your efforts will be equally rewarded!
