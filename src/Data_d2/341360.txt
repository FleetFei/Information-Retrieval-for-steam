							Catch the celebrity.Avoid the paparazzi.Paparazzi is a local multiplayer game of cat-and-mouse. The celebrity runs, dashes, and hides while the paparazzi tries to take constant photos of them. It's a simple yet competitive arcade-action game with a Where's Waldo feel. It's a test of focus and reflexes and a silly take on celebrity culture.Each match is a tug-of-war battle between a celebrity (battling for dignity) and a paparazzo (battling for money). When the paparazzo player takes a picture of the celebrity, the paparazzo gains money while the celebrity loses dignity. If the celebrity collects an adoring fan, they regain a chunk of their dignity. At the end of each round, when the celebrity reaches the limo, the winner is the player that has more dignity or money!Matches can be played multiplayer, with one celebrity player and one paparazzo, or single player as celebrity vs. a paparazzo AI.
