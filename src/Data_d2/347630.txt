							About This Game
							 It's FREE! Fight in turn-based multiplayer battles up to 9v9 with the old school graphics you've been missing! Enter battle as a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer of either gender, and use a card to transform into any of 16 characters, combining their stats and abilties with your class's!  Elemental properties for every character; collect gems that let you choose yours, and cast its magic!  Gain Charge during battle to do more damage, boost specific stats, and more-- or just save your turns for later and pummel an enemy all at once!  A rockingly awesome soundtrack!  Journey through eight intense Trials to gain cards and gems for use in the Arena!  Enjoy the 2-player tactical-RPG-style Card Game-- a great additional game on its own, it lets you earn cards and gems too!  In the mood to just chat for a bit?  Hang out in the lobbies, the Card Game, or even the audience of the Arena! Wins in large battles are recorded to the server and periodically posted, so people can see where you rank! Updated just before the Steam release with new backgrounds and other improvements! Play as a Champion (boss) and take on 9 enemies at once!
