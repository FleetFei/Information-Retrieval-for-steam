							This is the Original Soundtrack of Divinia Chronicles: Relics of Gan-Ti! The soundtrack currently features 24 tracks with more tracks being added as the game expands.Our soundtrack is composed by a group of amazing musicians among UBISOFT’s experienced music supervisor Christian Pacaud from Canada, talented composer Shayne Johnson from Australia and composing enthusiast Philipp Fuhrmann from Germany. Being a small group of dedicated students with no money to spend on music, we have been blown away by quality and love all composers put into their work for the project. It has been an amazing journey and we are happy to finally to share some of that with you today.We are excited to offer the music of Divinia Chronicles as a standalone soundtrack, we hope you enjoy it wherever you are or travel. While the soundtrack will include many tracks which are not included in the game (yet), it is not required to play the game whatsoever. Instead, it is supposed to be a way of “giving back” to our longtime followers and offers new players the chance to “buy us a coffee” as well (if you do like to do so) :-)To listen to the music, you can either use Steam's own music player, or find the songs as MP3s in the game install folder.Track List01 - Gate to a new world02 - Deep inside the woods03 - King of the desert04 - Black frost05 - Palace of water06 - Medari village07 - Beach resort08 - A long road ahead09 - The sparcles of life10 - A friend of nature11 - Off to new shores12 - One moment of peace13 - Full moon14 - Victory fanfare15 - Eternal sadness16 - Discolored mind17 - Praying to the moon18 - Peaceful glacier19 - Where our story began20 - Music box21 - Cries of battle22 - Fierce tango23 - Tears of sorrow24 - Blossom and decay
