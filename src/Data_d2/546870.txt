							About This Game
							Merchants and Mercenaries is a hectic real-time strategy that looks and feels like the board games you love, with none of the waiting. Expand your empire, get resources and trade them, hire merchants to discover new riches or hire mercenaries to take it all. There’s no one way to play, or even to win, but you’d better be fast!

- Advance through the Ages to build a castle first, then defend it!

- Quickly learn to read the lie of the land as the board is never the same twice.

- Build and upgrade farms, mines, quarries and lumberyards to expand your territory and gain resources.

- Trade resources on the open market (sell when hot, buy when not!).

- Hire merchants to discover new riches.

- Deploy a range of mercenaries to their best advantage.

- Attack strategic hexes that sever and destroy sections of your opponents’ empires for the most destruction possible.

Online multiplayer coming soon to all your favorite devices so you can enjoy everything you love about social board games, anytime, anywhere.
