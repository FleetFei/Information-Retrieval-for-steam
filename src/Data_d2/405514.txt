							Raised in the mystical city of K'un-L'un, Danny Rand sought vengeance on the man he blamed for the death of his parents. Driven by vengeance, Danny was tutored in the ways of martial arts. Excelling at his training, Danny was given the opportunity to take the sacred mantle of "Iron Fist" by fighting the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying and plunging his hands into its molten heart, rendering his hands "like unto iron." Upon finding the man responsible for his parents' death, Danny chose to forgive him and would instead use his skills to help people, eventually putting him on the path to form Heroes for Hire with his new and like-minded friend, Luke Cage.Items Included in this Pack:Iron Fist in default Immortal Weapon of Agomatto CostumeIron Fist Hero S.T.A.S.H.
