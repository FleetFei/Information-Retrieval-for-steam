							About This Game
							From David Pittman (Eldritch, NEON STRUCT) and Minor Key Games (Super Win the Game, Gunmetal Arcadia), Slayer Shock is a role-playing shooter about hunting vampires in Nebraska.Operating from your headquarters at a college coffee shop, you take missions to patrol the streets, rescue captive humans, and weaken the undead threat. A team of fellow vampire slayers assists you from HQ, providing new weapons, skills, and research.With a format that lovingly recalls scripted television (missions are "episodes", each campaign is a "season"), Slayer Shock blends immersive first-person action, lightweight strategy, and procedural narrative into a uniquely thrilling experience.Assemble a team, hunt the vampires, and save your hometown!
