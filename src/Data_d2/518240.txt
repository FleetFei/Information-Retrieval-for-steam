							L.A. Sharknado survivor Fin arrives in New York as a massive storm begins to pummel the city. Just as Fin realizes this is no ordinary squall, tornadoes full of sharks appear on the horizon. Soon, no vehicle, building, or national monument is safe from the destruction, and Fin must make the perilous journey across town to rescue his family before they, and all of New York, are turned into chum.
