"It's Killing Time" is an ultra-violent 140,000-word interactive novel by Eric Bonholtzer, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

Earn respect, reputation, and wealth as a hired assassin. You'll be dressed to kill, driving an exotic car with outlandish weapons in the trunk.

But in the glamorous, fast-paced world of murder-for-hire, you can never know who to trust and who's gunning to take you out. Who will betray you? Whom will you betray?

Will you be a spiritual hitman or hitwoman, a ruthless assassin, a total psychopath, or a righteous killer? The choice is yours.
