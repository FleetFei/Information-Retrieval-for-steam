							Original Soundtrack from Blue Rider with 12 tracks from the game.

A dark electronic down tempo music with excellent melodies and orchestrations, the album evolves adding more action and textures like the game. The form and function within the music are working together for the sound game evolution.
Listen carefully to find the musical connections among the tracks and feel again the emotion of shooting everywhere and destroying those bastards!
