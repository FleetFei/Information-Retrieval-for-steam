							We're off with our friends on another railroad journey! Margaret didn't just mope around, she's taken out another loan with the bank. This time she has a limited amount of time to fix the broken parts of the railroad, but now the areas are more interesting and have additional objectives. Moreover, the bank has set this land aside for the construction of an entire city, and if Margaret isn't up to the task the banker won't miss his chance to tease our unlucky friends.40 Varied and Challenging Levelsbuild An Entire City!enhanced Graphics & Varied Objectivesplay Without A Timer In Relaxed Mode
