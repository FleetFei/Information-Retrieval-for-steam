							Composer Arkadiusz Reikowski, whose soundtracks perfectly manifest terror and fear, created the Layers of Fear soundtrack with two distinct parts: First the lyrical element, which represents the Painterâ€™s wife, and second the dark, eerie, tones which capture the feeling of a mind slowly slipping toward insanity.
 
In addition to his composition for Layers of Fear, Arkadiusz is well known for his work with renowned Silent Hill singer Mary E. McGlynn on the title Kholat, and for his long time collaboration with Akira Yamaoka.
