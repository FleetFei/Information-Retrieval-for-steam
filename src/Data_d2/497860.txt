							About This Game
							Zezenia Online is a growing free-to-play 2D MMORPG, inspired heavily by the MMORPG Tibia. Zezenia Online features a large map of 4 continents with hundreds of spells, monsters and quests to explore. There are 3 main classes, and you can ascend your character to one of the 7 available subclasses at a later stage in the game.

The game is created by fans of the old MMORPG Tibia, which explains the similarity in graphics style and gameplay. However, the game is not purely a ripoff or an "Open Tibia server", but rather its own game with many unique aspects in game mechanics and "feel", that you will notice upon trying it out.

If you are into PVP you'll be delighted to partake in the fast-paced and skill-based action the game provides. Should you prefer to play in peace there is a Non-PVP world available as well.

Other notable game features include dungeons, gathering of ingredients and brewing of potions, player housing, a task system (including boss tasks), battle & soccer arenas and more!
