							About This Game
							Idol Hands is a strategy game where you gradually take over the world by guiding your people and defeating other gods. You are a god in a time of many gods. Rather than having direct control over your people’s actions, your people will live their own lives; placing buildings, growing crops, and micro managing themselves. Without you, your people are directionless! Your powers will provide them with usable land, protect them from attack, and control nature to their benefit. With your help they can grow and prosper; allowing them to increase the bounty of their harvests, and learn skills to eventually forming an immense fighting force that you can unleash upon your enemy’s population to wipe them out, leaving any other god powerless and defeated. Key Features: Play God with a nation of followers ready to respond to your command. Shape a beautiful and fully-3D land as you see fit, carving out your perfect world. Feel the power! Unleash massive natural disasters, striking your enemies down before you. Play the game in the way that you want to. Multiple strategies mean that no two games will ever be the same.
