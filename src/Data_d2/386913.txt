							Note! You can purchase only 1 Pack of the same value to 1 Wind of Luck: Arena account. Refund is not provided if you purchase 2 different packs, which include the same ship or you already have the ship from the pack!

Beginner's Pack includes:

• Packetboat, tier III famous ship of Mediterranean region along with a free ship slot on shipyard. 
• Admiral account for 7 days

Packetboat is a two-masted, fast ship, very capable in battle. Good firepower provided by a dozen of light cannons (5 on each board and 2 chase guns), tough hull structure and quite good downwind speed makes it formidable foe even to larger ships. Packetboats were extensively used in European coastal mail services and in times of war they were served as primary mean of communication between fleets.
