							In The Demo:In the Scraps Builder Demo you can try out building vehicles and testing them out on the test map.The demo also lets you join LAN games. That's right: Only one person needs to own the game to play on LAN. Someone who owns the full version hosts a game, and the demo can then be used to join it.It doesn't include combat (unless you've joined a LAN game) - you'll need the full version for that.Description For The Full Game:Scraps is a vehicle combat game where you build your vehicle from parts, and where success lies just as much in designing a well-crafted vehicle as in your combat skills. Design from the chassis up, then pit your creation against humans or AI in a combat arena.Scraps lets you create a vehicle that’s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons – that’s okay. You decide what you drive. When you take out other players, you can scavenge from the wreckage too, and use it to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.Your design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle.In the full version you can Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet, plus easily host your own LAN or Internet games.Language note:The only complete language at this time is English, but partial in-game translations are selectable for Russian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, and Swedish.
