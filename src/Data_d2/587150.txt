Now, the Chasm is inhabited by spider-eye goblins and their spider allies, but it is also thought to be the resting place of powerful artifacts from that elder age."Gauntlet of Spiragos" is a Scarred Lands adventure designed for 1st level characters, although it can be easily modified for characters of up to 5th level.Released on January 26, 2017.
