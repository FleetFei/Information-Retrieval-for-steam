							King Dugan's Dungeon is the game that takes place after Gunthro and the Epic Blunder.  Once you've completed "Gunthro", either KDD or Journey to Rooted Hold is a great place to continue playing.What happened to Beethro Budkin on his first excursion into King Dugan's Dungeon?  Well, mainly it was just the usual dungeon exterminator's subterranean grind: killing off thousands of man-eating roaches, chopping through tar, guzzling mimic potions, and generally ridding the King's underground chambers of all vermin that should not be there.  But also Beethro met an unexpected enemy, created lifelong grudges against him, and learned secrets that would later motivate his journey to Rooted Hold.King Dugan's Dungeon has been around in different forms for years.  It is the original game that started many DROD players' careers.  Now we've upgraded it to make full use of the latest DROD engine.  King Dugan's Dungeon now has challenge achievements, better graphics, new rooms, new secrets and post-mastery area, and complete voice acting for Beethro and other characters.KDD features twenty-five levels and over 350 rooms!To play this DLC:Start "DROD: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder"Click "Play Game", then click "Change Location".Select "King Dugan's Dungeon" and click "Okay".
