							In 199X, you control Clara. That's the problem.The doctors say she's delusional, but you both know that can't be true. The two of you need to explore Delilah, the town where Clara lives. You need to navigate her messy, personal relationships. Most of all, you need to find a cure. And beat the game. 199X is a 2-3 hour narrative adventure, split into seven playable days. It is written by Evan Tognotti, and features a full-length original soundtrack from acoustic weirdo Kearney. Play 199X. Help you help herself.---WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING"199X advertises itself as a 'game without mechanics,' which is probably because it is another crappy Steam Greenlight game made in RPG Maker. It is a 'lightly interactive' game (aka players basically press the arrow keys) and features a whooping one protagonist. Again, this is because this is a horrible excuse for a 'game' made using a horrible excuse for a 'game engine.' Not only that, but the developer of this game has the utter gall to charge for this couple hour 'interactive experience.' Although is (sic) is only $2 US, it is still disgusting people are being charged for this crap." - Lusipurr.com"There is also quite a bit of social justice in this game which makes parts feel a little bit like a (sic) 'educational game' or propaganda... don't expect any male characters to have any depth or role in the plot, it's all about the ladies and the male characters are there for window dressing." - A Steam reviewer
