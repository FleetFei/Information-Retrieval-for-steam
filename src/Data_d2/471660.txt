							About This Game
							Hanging out with friends, bombing walls, and smashing bottles would be much more fun with out the jail time.

Kingspray Graffiti offers realistic spray and drip effects that allow you to spray collaboratively with up to four players at once from anywhere in the world! 

Choose the right cap and pressure to paint with, and choose from a wide range of predefined colours, or create your own. Join in the painting or just hurl barrels, bricks, bottles and other heavy objects at your mates to show them how much you dig their work.

To save your work take a photo or a selfie, load it back up and keep painting later on. Afterwards, watch your avatar replay your creations to share your technique or show off your speed. Share your artwork with friends, and download other people's work to admire their technique or just spray over! 

Some features:

- Multiplayer 4 players.
- 4 intractable locations + Lab to spray in
- 360 screen captures. 
- Stroke for stroke replay of saved art.
- Projector / Reference - Load up images for reference or project them onto the paint surface.

Required : HTC Vive
