							Fifth Edition Foes is a first step into supporting the Fifth Edition of everyone’s favorite roleplaying game. The monsters in this book should be familiar to anyone who enjoyed the Tome of Horrors supplements (all four volumes of it) published by Necromancer Games during the Third Edition era. Many of these monsters reach back further than those books, though, since they’re culled from First Edition volumes such as the Fiend Folio (1981) andMonster Manual II (1983)—and those books drew material from the even older pages of magazines like The Dragon and White Dwarf. So while the stat blocks and powers of these creatures are as up-to-date as we could make them, they also harken back to the very early years of roleplaying games, when any addition to the game—every new monster, spell, or magic item—was completely new and exciting.The monsters include black and white images and tokens cropped from those images. They are presented in several, searchable indexes that list the monsters by CR, monster type and in alphabetical order.Spells are listed by name only; however, the full descriptions and Difficulty Classes are set upon use if a matching name is found in any open modules you have, such as within the SRD 5 (System Reference Document for fifth edition).Requires: An active subscription or 1-time standard or Ultimate license of Fantasy Grounds from Steam and the built-in 5E ruleset.Compatible with the 5E RulesetConversion by: Jim Hauber
