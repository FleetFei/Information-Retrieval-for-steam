							Tetradecagon is the ultimate game of pong. Bounce a ball off of the highlighted sides of a user-controlled polygon for as long as humanly possible. As time progresses, the ball will quicken in speed and the polygon will grow in number of sides. It seems extremely simple at first, but it quickly turns into a brutally difficult game. Tetradecagon will easily provide hours of intense, rage-inducing fun and will quench anybody's thirst for extremely challenging and exciting amusement.For those with photosensitive epilepsy, an epileptic friendly option has been added. Those who are not satisfied with this option are entitled to a refund.
