							About This Game
							RAIDEN LEGACY is a four-title compilation of the mega-popular RAIDEN arcade series including RAIDEN, RAIDEN FIGHTERS, RAIDEN FIGHTERS 2 & RAIDEN FIGHTERS JET. 

The first episode takes place in 2090 while a massive Alien invasion threatens the entire Earth. To repel the onslaught of those bad guys known as Cranassians, the World Alliance Military has developed a daring counter-attack with a powerful new weapon: the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter. Be a brave pilot and use Raiden’s powerful weaponry to fight against waves of enemy ships and save the human race!

Each title includes three different modes: “Arcade Mode” (just like the original); “Mission Mode”, which allows you to play any unlocked stage; and “Training Mode”, which, true to its name, allows you to excel at your favorite stages and practice the most difficult ones!
Originally developed by Seibu Kaihatsu, each of these classic scrolling arcade shooters have been enhanced with brand-new features:

•	1 - 2 simultaneous players (local + online)
•	15+ different ships, each with their own characteristics, stats, weapons, and powerups!
•	Remastered HD soundtrack for Raiden Fighters 1 & 2 and Raiden Fighters Jet
•	Full gamepad support
