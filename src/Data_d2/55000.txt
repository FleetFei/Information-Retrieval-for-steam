							Lead your orbital battleships to victory in Flotilla! Fight, trade, and explore new planets in your journey through the galaxy.
					Discover upgrades and artifacts to install on your fleet ships, and engage in battle with bounty hunters and pirate space-chickens. Featuring tactically rich 3D combat, flank and surprise the enemy from any direction. And when the dust settles, generate another uniquely randomized universe for a brand-spanking new adventure!

					There is no "up" in space: Explore the tactical richness of full 3D movement. Watch your angles and flank the enemy from all directions.
					Configure your fleet: Find loot throughout your adventures, and install upgrades and artifacts to your flotilla of ships.
					Play with a friend: Grab a buddy and play through the adventure cooperatively in splitscreen.
