							About This Game
							You will not find a full gaming experience here, but rather level samples that represent the games pacing, mood, and difficulty.

We have entered early access and this build of The Last Sunshine was initially our demo for alpha testing. As a result not all of the assets are current, although they may be updated in the future. We're always looking for feedback on gameplay as well as any kind of bugs you may find. Thanks for playing!
