							Dream's Official Soundtrack, composed by Norman Legies, contains more than 2 hours of music from Dream! It comprises 23 tracks from the game, 18 additional bonus tracks and 2 piano music sheets for everybody interested in the 3 year development of Dream, and the work process of our composer. Working on Dream was a blast for me. With Dream being my first full video game project, I tried my best to compose music that is moody, melancholic and always a bit wondrous and mystic. I hope you like the O.S.T. and are interested as well in the Bonus content, containing many prototypes, alternate versions and musical studies that I've done during the development. I wanted to present you a complete image of the game's development music-wise, and hope you're having fun comparing versions, seeing similarities, or just enjoy the original soundtrack.Thank you very much for listening!All the best, Norman.DREAM Official O.S.T.Track List (1:39:47)1.
