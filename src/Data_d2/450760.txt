							*** Old school pixel-art scroll-shooter ***Sometimes the enemies will rush you in hordes wave by wave. It’s about time to grab a machine-gun (flamethrower, chainsaw or bazooka?) and make mincemeat out of them. This old school pixel-art shooter offers an unusual weapon upgrade system. Damaging enemies will give you points that can be spent to upgrade your primary or secondary weapon, which you can choose from about 40 different items. Upgrade is not limited with changing of parameters – you can replace materials, ammo or attack type for your weapon, each having a unique upgrade list. The game offers hot seat to play with your friends using just one computer, as well as full joysticks support, making it so comfy and familiar as if you're back to your childhood years. Flexible modification system will allow you to create your own maps, enemies, weapons and upgrades. You will need just a plain text and image editor to add whatever you want to the game and share it with your friends.
