							About This Video
							Hidden in the heart of Echo Park, Los Angeles, is a giant array of shimmering bottles and colored light—something called the Phantasma Gloria. Or at least that’s what Randlett Lawrence calls his massive folk art creation that “catches the sun” and takes up his entire lawn. “Randyland” is a film that explores how one man can create—with nothing but a little bit of glass and wire, and a lot of imagination and determination—a massive monument to the world and its beauty by capturing the sun itself!
