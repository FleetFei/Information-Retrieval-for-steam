Struggling to react, the old government faction sent the order to a secret information organization ‘Igasei’ to initiate an assassination program called ‘Yatagarasu’ and eliminate the leaders of the coup d’etat.OverviewYatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm is an original, traditional-style 2D fighting game with 11 playable characters and which focuses on delivering solid game play and high quality production values.Creative TalentYatagarasu AoC features 2D pixel art by KOTANI:Tomoyuki AKA Styleos (King of Fighters, Mushihimesama, Ibara), and arresting character art by Miwa Shirow (Dogs, Black Mind) and Yasuda Suzuhito (Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor).Voice acting talent includes Kaji Yuki (Attack on Titan, Final Fantasy XIII, Genso Suikoden), Uchida Maaya (IDOLM@STER, Holy Knight), and TOUGEKI announcer Koori Masoi.The Yatagarasu soundtrack is created by Raito (Melty Blood, Under Night In-birth) and performed by doujin songstress LIQU@.GameplayYatagarasu AoC’s gameplay takes inspiration from Street Fighter III, but incorporates elements similar to BlazBlue.
