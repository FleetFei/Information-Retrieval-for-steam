							About This Game
							New adventure game with gawky handymen from the legendary series.
						"Pat & Mat" is puzzle adventure game for everyone. All settings are based on the popular TV stop-motion series about "Pat & Mat", two handymen. Although the game is fully 3D rendered in real-time, it still keeps the dreamy look of stop-motion movies (characters are modeled in “puppet-style” and animations simulate “stop-motion“ animation process). Player is taking control of both Pat & Mat and solve various tasks by cooperation and help of both characters.
						Key features:
						World-wide known brand. (Pat and Mat are well known in many countries all over the world. Game doesn’t just “use” the name – it really simulates the popular TV series on your PC.)
						The very same Pat and Mat you know from your TV. (3D reconstruction of both puppets. The game looks just like the TV series)
						Humor for everyone. (Funny animations, funny situations, funny actions all the time.)
						Untypical problem solving. (Creating “the incredible machine” etc.)
						Huge amount of “mini-games” and “micro-games”.
						Wide audience. It is for children – and their parents. Casual players will like the humor and easy-to-use controls, gamers will enjoy original approaches and non-typical puzzle solving.
