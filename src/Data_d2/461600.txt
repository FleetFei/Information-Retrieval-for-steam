							About This Game
							The story of Zipple continues!
The frog warrior this time must save the companions of the village and bring them to the houses scattered in the playing field.
To pass each level you have to transport a certain number of frogs (scattered in the playfield) to the houses of the village. All that by running, jumping and killing enemies.

VERY IMPORTANT:

To move the "frogs-objectives" just double-click on a point to activate the direction "HERE"; then you have to drag these companions (with the label "SAVE ME!") into the houses of the village (label "HOME").
To catch the "magic boxes" just touch it to activate the elastic to the protagonist; then you have to drag these objects (with the label "TAKE") into the houses of the village (label "HOME").
The tents with label "DANGER" are the enemy bases.
There are various types of enemies of various species, and there are movable obstacles and bonuses falling from the sky. You can also kill enemies by jumping on them.
