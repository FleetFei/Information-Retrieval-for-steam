							About This Game
							Are you afraid of heights?  Take an elevator to our plank that’s sits 160m high (525 feet) above the ground, then dare to walk to the end!   

Richie’s Plank Experience was made to demonstrate virtual reality to our friends and family. It’s a short experience that all our visitors have reacted too - exhilaration, fear and laughter - it’s always surprising to see how each person reacts. 

Use a physical plank for added immersion. Customise your plank dimensions in the settings.  

We also have options to add spiders, cake or doughnuts to the end of the plank! 

Includes additional elevator levels: 

Fire Deck
If you want to know what it feels like to be a super-hero, here’s your chance. Use your controllers to fly around the virtual city. Extinguish fires that blaze throughout the city with a fire hose and rocket hands. 

Sky Brush
A sky writing simulator where you can paint the sky different colours using your rocket hands as a paintbrush.


NOTE: The plank dimensions and orientation are customisable.  If you want to use a real-world plank we have made suggestions on our website (use 'Manual' on store page for link).
