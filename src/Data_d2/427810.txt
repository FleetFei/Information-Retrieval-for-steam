Calendula is your deepest secret... About CalendulaCalendula begins as a usual game... until it is not anymore.The player's goal will be to unveil the mystery behind an apparently broken game, but it won't be easy. Calendula's mechanics are entirely focused on the struggle of trying to start a game, exploring the limits of the 4th wall and breaking with conventions. Calendula's aesthetics follows an increasing obscure atmosphere, plunging the player into a disturbing, thrilling experience.The narrative is built within a labyrinth of metaphors and abstractions, ready to be unraveled. Unlike other games, the player will feel as if things didn't work the way they should, similar to Twin Peaks' Red Room (David Lynch). The player's journey goes from simple to complex, from bright to somber, from real to dreamlike. To follow Calendula's path, the player will have to use his wit and think outside the box. In this case, a tiny oppressive box.Please, remember this: It is not your fault.
