							About This Game
							Build and design your own fleets and stand opposed to the Particulate in this physics/strategy/RTS/fleet hybrid.  Build partially destructible and self repairing ships that interact with enemies less controlled by some scripted logic and more driven by a real time massive physics particle simulation.
