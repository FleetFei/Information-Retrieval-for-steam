							In this Shakespearean comedy adventure, can forbidden love conquer adorable fairy outlaws? "A Midsummer Night's Choice" is a 190,000-word interactive fantasy novel by Kreg Segall, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination."Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind"When your father, the Duke, tries to force you to marry, you'll leave civilization behind as you flee in disguise, cross-dressed, into the enchanted forest. Mistaken identities, inexplicable bears, and tiny but fearsome fairies await! (Seriously, they wear little walnut shells for helmets, and ride armored baby bunnies into battle.)Will you fall into the mysterious Faerie Queene's clutches? Will you (or your identical doppelganger) find true love? Or will your father's spies find you first?Hold on to your heart! The course of true love never did run smooth. Play as male or female, gay, straight, or bi. Inspire the world with your noble deeds, or play everything for laughs. Star in a play within a play. (Er, within a game...that you are playing.) Become a jester, a diplomat, a knight, a poet, a shepherd--or leave the world behind and join the fairy court. Why is there a bear?!
