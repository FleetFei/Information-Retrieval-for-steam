							About This Game
							Modular Combat is a role-playing shooter based in the Half-Life universe, that has been out since 2008.The Resistance, Combine, and Aperture Science are testing the HEV Mark VI Combat System. Combatants face off against each other, and monsters, in the Controlled Combat Testing Facility, which is monitored by a super-computer known as BoSS.There are dozens of modules that can be upgraded at any level, in any combination. Modules give combatants amazing abilities such as flying, teleporting, spawning minions, and shooting flechettes or energy balls. Basically, if you want to kill something in a special way...We have a module for that.------To everyone who is complaining about Half-Life 2 now being required to play/install.  Valve forced it on Modular Combat and all other HL2 modifications.  We've tried and we were unable to get it removed.
