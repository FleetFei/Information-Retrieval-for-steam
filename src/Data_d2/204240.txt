The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.Key Features 48 thought-provoking puzzles, each unique from the rest, all requiring an innovative solution. Gravity manipulations, gravitational vortexes, parallel dimensions, and many more mind-bending concepts in a world where the laws of physics are not what they seem. M. C. Escher-esque worlds with impossible architecture set in the style of beautifully hand-drawn black-and-white lithographic art.
