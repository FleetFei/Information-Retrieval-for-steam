							About This Game
							 Roguelite catacombs that evolve and expand with each of your successes. Hundreds of items, enemies and rooms, and dozens of epic boss fights. Fully playable with keyboard+mouse or gamepad. 5 difficulty levels range from "Relatively Easy" to "Nigh Impossible." Play as a "head in a mech" harvested from the neck of everyone's favorite Hydral. Find secrets of The Megalith, a giant structure lodged in a star, as you lose many heads. Figure out what happened to Rodney, an AI redshirt of uncertain motives. Over-the-top mod support.  Detailed wiki: create enemies, items, weapons, and rooms. Secrets!  Among them "incredibilities" that massively change the way the game plays. Varied mech suits: dipole magnetism, time control, and more. Upgrade during each "run" via EXP/Perks, shops, and items found while exploring.
