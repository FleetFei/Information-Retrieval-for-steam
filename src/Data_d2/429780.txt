							About This Game
							Inspired by old school first person shooters, Bunny Hop League takes you right back to the golden age of gaming, when hopping, strafing and sliding were all the rage. 

In most games, these techniques are used to make yourself a harder target or move faster. However, in Bunny Hop League, they are core mechanics, used to get from one place to another as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

Bunny Hop League is an arcade-oriented game that's about challenging yourself and reaching your goal as fast as possible. While it can be hard to master, it's extremely rewarding when you finally do!
