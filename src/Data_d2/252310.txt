							About This Game
							Killing zombies never gets old, but sometimes you just need a break. 

Get back to some serious old-school gaming with Syder Arcade! Syder Arcade is a love letter to Amiga games of the â€˜90s, no coins, no upgrade grinding, just your tenacity and a motherload of alien invaders. 

Syder Arcade is a free scrolling, multi directional shoot 'em up, an uncompromised old-school experience, furious, challenging, and straightforward. This game will bring you back in time, when bulky starships were cool and games were about player skill and swearing madly at your computer.
