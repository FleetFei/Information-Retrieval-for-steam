							About This Game
							ESSEN, on the verge of the 20th century: solar energy and clean power do not yet exist but there is “an endless supply of coal”. You are the owners of coal mines and it is your responsibility to produce lorries, send them below ground, and mine all the coal you can wrest from your pits. You must also acquire and fulfill orders to gain victory points. However, the orders are very specific about the kind of coal they demand. Since each kind is in a different pit level, you sometimes must go deeper... and this is expensive. 
GLÜCK AUF is a deep yet easy-to-learn boardgame that is as suitable for families as it is for experienced gamers. The pits and their moving cages ensure a gaming delight on all “levels”. Glück Auf!
