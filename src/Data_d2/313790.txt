							Champion of Aura Pack is specially designed to help new players start successful characters. It contains all necessary consumables, mounts and pets for every taste, starter weapons for every class (already improved to maximum level so they will not become obsolete too fast) and some unique items unobtainable otherwise.

Note! You can purchase only 1 Champion of Aura pack to 1 Royal Quest account. Your purchase will be available in both EU and US regions. All items are account bound and non-transferrable between regions. Pets become character bound upon use.

To distribute items among your characters please select character on the character selection screen and click golden chest in the bottom center of the screen. Select an item to give it to selected character. Items will arrive in characters' mailbox in-game.
