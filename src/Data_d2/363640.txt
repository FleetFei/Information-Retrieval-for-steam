A few words from composer - Panu Talus:

"I worked with this fantastic indie game about an entire year. 
All the music was composed by using analog and digital synthesizers and everything are hardware (not a cheap hobby). 
Many songs required a lot of work but there are also moments of instant, spontaneous improvising. 

For fellow gear nerds, here is list of my setup used for the game soundtrack.
Synthesizers/sound sources: 
- Yamaha CS-50 
- Roland RS-505 
- Sequential Circuits Pro-One 
- Generalmusic S3 Turbo 
- Technics WSA1 
- Roland JV-2080 (+ Vintage Synth, Orchestral, World) 
- Roland JD-990 (+ Vintage Synth) 
- Korg X3R 
- Yamaha EX-5R 
- Korg O3 Symphony Module (choir) 
- Akai S2000 (Spectrasonics - Symphony of voices) 
- Yamaha CP-60M 
- Simmons SDS8 

Effects: 
- Lexicon 224 
- Lexicon PCM-70 

All the sequences were performed in live, triggered and transposed with Zyklus MPS-1 - Midi Performance System, except in "Virtual reality" where Pro-One was used. Oberheim Systemizer handles the advanced master keyboard functions".
