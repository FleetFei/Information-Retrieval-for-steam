							About This Game
							The White Laboratory, created by Tao, is a sandbox style tower defense game about reusing the onslaught of geometric blocks in an abstract world. It explores shapes and combinations for making modular defense towers, whose material are obtained from dead bodied of the enemies. In the laboratory, you will experiment with permutations and survive the invasion just out of those block pieces, no tricky level upgrades.For more information, visit http://labtd.com.
