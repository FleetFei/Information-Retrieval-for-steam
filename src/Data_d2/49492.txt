							Fully-unlocked “Dark Heavens” white and black deck. The protective elegance of Angels and the destructive furor of Demons combine to make up this powerful deck. Its true power lies in its ability to dominate the skies with some of the most powerful flying creatures Duels of the Planeswalkers has ever seen. The chillingly beautiful Angel of Despair gracefully purifies the battlefield by removing the biggest threat. Additional content for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. (Requires the most recent version of Magic 2012 and Magic 2012 Deck Pack 2.)
