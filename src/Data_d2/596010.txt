							About This Video
							Exploring the double-edged sword of being a recognizable celebrity, Andy Kaufman's ridiculous parody of "My Dinner With Andre" sets Andy Kaufman, playing himself, at an early-morning breakfast with former wrestling champion Fred Blassie. Kaufman and Blassie discuss wrestling, stardom, hygiene, weather to eat bacon or sausage in this classic piece of performance art and other topics not nearly as intellectual as the ones discussed in My Dinner With Andre.
