							About This Game
							Welcome to Prominence Poker, a game that pits players from around the world against each other--and devious AI--to build the rep, prestige, and bankroll needed to be, and beat, the best of the best.

Rich World 
Set in the city of Prominence, a gambling Mecca founded by crooked folks looking to go straight, players will face down four factions as they play their way solo to a final showdown with "The Mayor"--the mysterious town founder who will guide the player through their career.

Robust Community
Beyond solo play, gamblers will find a deep multiplayer experience with regularly scheduled events, daily challenges, tournaments, ranked modes, and even more as the game evolves over time.
