							About This Content
							The fully unlocked “Avacyn’s Glory” deck. Take on the mantle of a knight of Avacyn as you marshal your troops against the forces of darkness. You have sworn to hold the village against all odds and nothing will sway you from your oath. Control powerful angels as you sweep across the battlefield, using your spells and enchantments to clear out your enemies below. Send your foes back to the hell-pits from which they spawned! Additional content for Magic 2014.
