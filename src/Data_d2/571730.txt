Presented as a global first at the Milan trade fair in 2014, the 401 Svartpilen received rave reviews from Husqvarna fans. This concept bike, whose name means Black Arrow in Swedish, is a modern road bike inspired by the golden age of motorbiking. Reduced to its essentials, the Svartpilen 401 is a new, cutting-edge bike thanks to its combination of advanced technology and stylish design. 
One of the best bikes in its class, the CBR900RR Fireblade retains the Honda ""total control"" imprint. Like its predecessor, this model boasts both front and rear new suspension and new rims, chosen by Honda engineers to increase the bikeâ€™s handling, stability and braking performance.
