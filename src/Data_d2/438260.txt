							About This Game
							Try. Try again. In Rewind you can clone yourself and manipulate time to solve both the puzzles and the mystery of why you are here. Use the weapons at your disposal to eliminate your enemies, even if it's yourself. Can you make it to the exit? You can only count on yourselves.

Created by Rachel "Angel_Mapper" Cordone, author of the award winning Unreal Tournament 3 mod "Prometheus", Rewind is the debut game from Stubborn Horse Studios.
