							Seeking to expand your mastery and defeat your foes? This Magic 2013 deck pack includes two brand-new decks for Campaign and Multiplayer play. With the red and white “Act of War” deck, your heroes will cut a path to the enemy’s door. If they stumble, cast tide-turning spells to light their way. The green and blue “Sky and Scale” starts slow and steady but wins by summoning titanic flying creatures to end your foes’ hopes. Hold your ground and rule the skies.
