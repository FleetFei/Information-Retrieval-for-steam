							About This Game
							DEFCON VR allows you to spectate DEFCON games in the comfort of your own virtual War Room. Join others and marvel at total global annihilation as nuclear missiles arc over the globe on their path to destruction.

Play as a General hidden deep within an underground bunker. Enter the Conference Room and join other players. When youâ€™re ready, select a DEFCON game and go to the War Room to spectate games where players fight for survival. Watch the strategies, alliances, and eventual betrayals as Bombers, Subs, and Ground Silos release their deadly payloads. 

DEFCON VR allows you to do all of this in a fully interactive virtual environment. Discuss plans around a holographic globe, mark attacks on the wall sized world map, or huddle around small screens all showing the action. Watch Armageddon unfold as everybody dies...
