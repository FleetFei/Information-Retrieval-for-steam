							The Ultimate Coffee Dueling Experience
Coffence is a high-octane fighting game combining the elegance of fencing with the pure joy of a tasty coffee. Partake in one on one caffeine fueled combat where your cup and your wits are your only weapons. Feint, lunge and strike as you try to empty your opponentâ€™s cup while protecting yours from relentless assaults. In the end, only one can reach true coffee bliss!FeaturesIn Coffence, you are in charge of every moves. Your left joystick controls your character while your right joystick controls your coffee-holding arm. This allows for surprising tactics and daring last minute scoops like you've never seen before.Contrary to classic fighting game conventions, your life is not linked to your character at all, but to the amount of coffee in your cup. Every strike you receive ejects the precious liquid upward allowing any participant to take it back for himself. Save yourself from the brink of defeat in one swift scoop or take a sip of your own coffee to unlock your true coffencing potential. Every drop counts.Coffencing is serious business. As such, we feel every match should be a showdown to be remembered. The screen shakes as cups collide, time slows down when the last drop flies in the air and wind blows from the point of impact bending trees in the scenery. Coffee break never felt this great.In Coffence, the level is half the fun. Master the way of the cup in all manners of location from a pirate ship all the way to a low gravity alien planet. Every level brings its own twist to the formula!
