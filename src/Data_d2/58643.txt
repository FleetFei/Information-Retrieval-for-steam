							"Fatal Error", the 4th free DLC for Wargame: European Escalation, brings you a brand new 5-mission long Operation, as well as a new and finely tuned multi-touch gameplay for owners of Ultrabook™ with touch¹ display. Inspired by Intel®!


This DLC focuses on solo play, adding a brand new fifth operation to Wargame's existing four. This 5-missions operation is completely independent to Wargame's original campaign, and will provide you new, bigger challenges to face.


Based on an original alternate history, Fatal Error will bring you back in 1979, a time when hopes for a peaceful settlement of the East/West tensions had never seem so close… until all hopes were shattered by the Euromissiles crisis, and the discovery of a Soviet combat brigade being deployed in Cuba. Within the depths of Mount Cheyenne, home to North America's most vital command center, a tragic mistake by a maintenance technician sets the world on fire…


The DLC Fatal Error does not only bring new missions; it also makes your game compatible with your Ultrabook™ with touch¹ display. Inspired by Intel®! Finely tuned with simplicity of use in mind, the multi-touch gameplay specifically crafted for Wargame will let you play comfortably installed in your couch, without the need for a mouse or a keyboard! Commanding your army has never been so accessible and intuitive.


Touch gameplay may work on other multi-touch devices, but is not officially supported.
