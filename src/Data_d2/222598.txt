							The commuter BR111 electric locomotive seen across Germany since the 1970s is now available for Train Simulator, with accompanying DBbzf Control Car and double decker passenger coaches.In the early 1970s, Deutsche Bahn’s demand for electric locomotives for passenger trains saw the development of the BR111, a successor to the Class 110 and built to accommodate faster speeds on passenger services.  A total of 227 models were built in the class between 1970 and 1982, with the first locomotive delivered in December 1974.Many of the class were put into service on S-Bahn services, although with ageing locomotive stock serving Intercity routes, some were fitted for Intercity services and operated across Germany. Each of the locomotive’s four axles were fitted with motors supplying 4,990hp (3,720 kW) and a top speed of 160km/h (99mph).The BR111 often operated in conjunction with a rear control car, giving push-pull capabilities on commuter services due to its ZWS remote control, operated from the locomotive. A third generation DBbzf control car is included with the BR111 for Train Simulator, alongside double-decker DBz and DAbz coaches.The BR111 for Train Simulator is available in two Deutsche Bahn liveries – Orient Red and Traffic Red - and features a DBbzf control car in mint turquoise and traffic red liveries, realistic wheel slip and sanding effects, SIFA driver vigilance device, PZB train protection system and double-decker coaches.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR111 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
