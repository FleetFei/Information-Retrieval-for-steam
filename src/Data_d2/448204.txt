							The Rnoos wagon is a four-axle open wagon designed for carrying freshly-cut and sawn timber and similar loads, typically for construction purposes. The Rnoos design represents an improvement over the previous Roos design by incorporating turn-down stanchions which avoid the need to relocate stanchions depending on the load carried.
