"I just like sniping as a game dynamic, and I liked how the game was trying to combine that with tactical placement.‚Äù - TechCrunch

Escape the Apocalypse. Zipline between vantage points surrounding the battle field and use heavy weapons to cover your teammate on longer and longer supply runs. 

Basic rules:
- Runner starts and ends at the train station
- Runner has a certain amount of ammunition which refills for each run
- Predict the runner's path and pave the way for him to return safely

The main game is about scavenging a series of maps, finding enough fuel & weapons in each stage to progress to the next.
Your runner finds supplies & fuel in the boxes, which he hands over to you after each run.
If things get tight, call the runner back any time.
Gather XP with your shooting kills to unlock perma-boosts and make sure to pick up some helicopter drops.

The first two maps can also be played in an endless practice scenario & also feature 15 strategic levels, each with a unique solution path that requires more than just shooting. Levels have a fix setup of where survivors come in and where the zombies are and can only be resolved with strategic and well-timed use of the available weapons and tools.
