							This DLC lets you support the continued development of Simply Chess and get a few bonuses out of it, in the process! No more cross-promotions for our other games. This way you can create a new game 7 seconds faster*! The game will now have a way to show up in your Steam Library. Unlocks the "Patron of the Arts" achievement. Adds a "Limitless" level of AI which unlocks the full potential of the Stockfish AI. You will not beat this AI. It is a helpful learning tool for analyzing what _should_ be done in a given situation. Any new features we add to Premium, you will get automatically!*: An average game of Simply Chess is around 40 minutes, so you will get a 0.3% speed improvement!  SO FAST!PLEASE NOTE: If you already own the Premium version through the previous In-App-Purchase system, you don't need to buy the DLC. You will be granted a DLC key the first time you play a game, for "free" (eg: you've already paid for it by buying the IAP whenever you did that) .
