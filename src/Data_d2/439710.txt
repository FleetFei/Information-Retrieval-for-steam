							A historical DLC for fans of the game and those who like to dig in the internal files, the Collection of Builds!
You can see the game's history throughout 14 different builds, including the most early ones - various beta versions, debug releases and demos will help you understand the difficult five-year path of the development. You can look at the early versions of the level editor, which could only create single rooms before, concept graphics which were hard to even look at, and many other things!
This DLC is for those who truly value Big Journey to Home!
