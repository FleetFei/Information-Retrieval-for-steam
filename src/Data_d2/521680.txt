							About This Game
							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. 

In this third round of releases we offer "Suikoden: Tenmei no Chikai," which was released outside of Japan under the name "Bandit Kings of Ancient China". 
It is a simulation game based on the novel "Suikoden" or "Water Margin," a Chinese classic. Players play as a bandit being pursued by imperial officers. You gather together a band of heroes, warriors, and magic using beauties, and campaign against Gaoqiu, the evil minister causing the downfall of the Song Empire.
