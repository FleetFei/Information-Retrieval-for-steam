							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Overdrive expansion.Professor Yoolip’s most dangerous invention is probably the 8-Bit Game Cartridge-to-Reality generator, which is capable of reading any game cartridge from that ‘80s and turn the world contained within to reality. When he first tried this invention, it unleashed dragons, demons, and countless other monsters into the world… and a lot of heroes that wouldn’t do anything unless told specifically where to go.Among these armored knights, boys in tights, and foreign princes, Yoolip found what appeared to be an 8-Bit version of himself… just sitting there, waiting for someone to take control of his destiny.Realising he had just become the hero to a dozen different games at the same time, Yoolip took matters into his own hands and modified his invention to allow him to take control of his 8-Bit counterpart. Now he and his Robo Dinos are ready for some old school action!This DLC contains a custom skin for Professor M. Yoolip in Awesomenauts. The 8-Bit Yoolip skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a uniquevoiceover, and special in-game audio effects for his abilities.
