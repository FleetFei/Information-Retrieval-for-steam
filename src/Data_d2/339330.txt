							Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. The soundtrack played a critical role in the game since day one!Composer Jake Kaufman used freely available hobbyist tools to write the soundtrack and program all the sound effects, resulting in over 2 hours of music that can actually be played on a real NES / Famicom console!Joining him is the legendary Manami Matsumae, who created the music and sound effects for the original Mega Man - one of the greatest soundtracks of all time - and inspired Jake and countless other composers to start their own careers in game music.It is our hope that THIS soundtrack might someday inspire a young composer or two to do the same.Once downloaded, MP3 files can be found in the Shovel Knight Steam directory as well as played from within the Steam Music Player!...\Steam\steamapps\common\Shovel Knight\Original Soundtrack
