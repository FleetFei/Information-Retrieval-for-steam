In the early 90's the Networker family was entering large scale service in the Network South East sector, there had always been a plan to combine the various capabilities of the different units (such as 165/165 and 465/466) in to a single dual voltage unit and this eventually became the Class 365.Although specified as a dual voltage unit, they have actually never operated in this way as they were only ever built with one system of traction current pick-up.All Class 365's in service have received a front end cab modification to equip them with cab air conditioning, the design of which gives the loco its nickname of "happy train".This add-on livery pack presents the unit in its earlier Network South East livery.You must own the East Coast Main Line London-Peterborough Loco Add-on before you will be able to use this add-on
