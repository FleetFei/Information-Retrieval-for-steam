Able to "phase" her body and anything she touches through solid matter, Kitty's been connected to the X-Men since the first time her powers came to light. Though her powers were originally considered passive, Kitty has learned to use them in various waves to save her friends and even the world! Not content with just a sharp wit and awesome power set, Kitty Pryde also possesses masterful knowledge of martial arts (thanks to an adventure with Wolverine) as well as a fire-breathing pet alien dragon, Lockheed!Items Included in this Pack:Kitty Pryde in default Astonishing CostumeKitty Pryde Hero S.T.A.S.H.
