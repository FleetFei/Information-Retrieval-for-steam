							About This Game
							Minaâ€™s rescue from the end of the first game is cut dramatically short and she and primate pal Jep are left again on the mysterious island to fend for themselves! Mina needs to dress her wounds and keep safe against the local wildlife, but now she has the assistance of the player controlled Jep who can fit in smaller spaces, move deftly through the jungle and even communicate with other animals in their bid to survive. Using even more combinations of items throughout the island, Mina and Jep will need to recover from their traumatic circumstances and find another way, any way, off the mysterious island!
