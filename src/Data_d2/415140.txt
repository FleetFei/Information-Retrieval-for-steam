							PD Howler 10 is a digital painting and visual effects program for Microsoft Windows (best on 7,8,10...)Going beyond advanced digital painting,  Howler includes numerous visual effects tools, like compositing, rotoscoping, re-timing with motion estimation, block interpolation to extrapolate un-finished frames from your 3D program, camera stabilization and camera motion removal.  Add motion blur to stop motion, keyframe FX filters on a timeline, scan frames and clean them up, and a lot more. There is also a 3D capability, particularly useful for generating realistic landscapes, mountains and other items defined by an elevation maps.  PD Howler also supports 2-D animation, light-table, lip-syncing, and working on video.Main Features:Paint: Digital painting with many types of brushes, including large custom images, image sequences (animated brushes that can be edited on a timeline), natural media brushes, particle brushes to spray paint grass and shrubberies or animate smoke and fireworks, bristle brushes for realistic oils and acrylics, “Orbicle” brushes with audio controlling their appearance, foliage brushes that grow and let you paint a complete tree in a single brush stroke, with 3D depth and ambient occlusion shading, plus a huge complement of presets.Animate: Video frame editing and post work for special FX, traditional frame-by-frame animation and working with video on video, time stretching, motion estimated interpolation, batch processing, frame repairing, motion tracking, chromakeying, green screen compositing, rotoscoping, rendering of frames with added 'breathing' motion, exposure sheet for manual syncing against an audio track.  Remove camera motion to simplify rotoscoping and other effects, then re-apply the camera's motion.  There's also a very comprehensive set of filters that work in realtime, most of them animatable either directly or on a timeline.3D: Capabilities include a 3D Designer for creating 3D terrains from elevation maps, adding erosion and sediments, coloration based on elevation and slope, ambient occlusion and raytraced shadows.  Puppy Ray rendering with global illumination and ray tracing on CPU or accelerated on the GPU, volumetric clouds with the animated Particle Modeler, and various filters for stylized lighting and perspective effects. You can render an animation wherein you fly across your landscape and keyframe its parameters. Exports for .obj format, erosion and elevation maps, texture map, shading maps, 3D mesh and feature maps (grass, rock and snow regions.)FX: Numerous filters for post work in various categories: Adjustment filters, Coloring, Blur, Photographic filters, Sharpening, Convolution filters, Transformation filters (including 3D transforms,) Video related filters, Cleanup, Artistic filters, Stylize filters, Rendered effect filters, and a collection of Animated filters. There is are also sets of filters that combine the main image with the alternate swap image.  You can have multiple animations stored in memory or on disc in order to have them handy to combine and composite.Paint features:Natural media, many presets, fully customizableFull digitazing tablet support, such as Wacom devicesCustom brushes, bristle brushes, particle brushes, foliage brushes, brushes under the influence of force fields3D orbiting particle brushes (Orbicles)Dynamic Rules-based Foliage brushesAnimated (multi-frame) custom brushesPigment lifting for realistic paint effectsWell over 100 fast full featured filters.

Main Tools found in the toolbar:Brush tool: for drawing and painting: Simple, Airbrush, Pen, Pencil, Oils, Tempera, Pastels, Watercolor, Effects brushes (such as Smear), Organic effects (flowers, stars,...), User, Particles, Bristle brushes, Paint on alpha and plenty more brush presets in the media Browser. Fill tool: to fill with palin colors, gradients or even patterns and images, straight or warped into the shape or selectionThe linear tool: draws along a sraight line, but with the current brush, whatever that brush does may not be so straightThe Curve tool: (it's almost like a paint program in itself). Includes animated features for rotoscoping and animating the shape of the curve. Insanely powerful. EVen simulates easing in and out at start and end of the brush stroke, to simulate the look of a tablet pen when using a mouse!Gradients, Lens flares and special effects: Linear gradient, circular gradient, gradient modes, linear gradient grabber, cumulative selection fader, Warp tool, Nova, awesome(!) lens flares, and LightningText tool: render the text into the image, or as selection to alpha channel, or make it the custom brush, even animated brushRectangle too: Hollow or Filled. Hollow is with current brush, filled is with current Fill settings.Ellipse tool: also hollow or filled circles and ovalsRectangle to alpha: one of many ways to build sophisticated selections. Use SHift to add/remove with left or right buttonEllipse to alphaLasso to alphaMagic WandCustom brush selector tool: pick a region from the current image, turn it into a custom brush, complete with alpha transparency from the current selection mask in the alpha channel.Color pickerScroll tool: move the image around.Zoom toolZoom 100%Fit the image to the windowUndo / Redo tool: use left or right button, even middle scroll button for interactive, blended undoClear the image: left click = just do it, right-click shows various optionsColor toggle: Primary vs. Secondary colorsThere is also a Sidebar, with numerous controls for:PreviewsCompact color pickerColor: more sophisticated color pickers: RGB, RGB2, Box, Triangle, Wheel, Mixer, Harmony, DOgwaffle color picker, Colors by name, system color picker, hex color picker and more.
