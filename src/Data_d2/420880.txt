							About This Game
							I must kill...: Fresh Meat is hand-drawn classic 2D point & click adventure with a light horror story. The story is about an unnamed butcher, who had his own world since childhood, from which he was violently torn away. Our butcher was never able to deal with the new age, therefore he considers everything modern including modern behavior as disgusting, and he despises the modern era.

I must kill...: Fresh Meat is not about jumpscares, but it is trying to pull in the player into the story with its atmosphere. The game is concurrently trying to show the player, that younger generation is addicted to modern technology, and is also disrespectful to each other.

Who is the human pig then? Butcher? Or the other?
