							About This Game
							Space Giraffe is an abstract action arcade style game that takes place in a succession of beautiful environments generated by an advanced graphics synthesizer.  It presents itself as a shooter but the more you play the more you discover the hidden depths and strategies that make the gameplay satisfyingly rich and rewarding.  This is the boldest evolution of the trance-shooter, created by the company that helped to define the genre with the groundbreaking “Tempest 2000”.                    
					                    
					200 levels of trancetastic action.                    
					Beautiful abstract graphics that respond to audio input.                    
					Deep gameplay that rewards strategic and thoughtful play.
