							This free DLC adds 4 new romances to the base game: Kaden, Galina, Christophe and Lola. All the 4 characters can be romanced by both Diana and Alex, for a total of 8 new romance routes!
Another addition it's the "Quick Play Mode", in which you can play single battles outside the main story campaign, using the cards you have unlocked so far. You can choose between 10 different group of enemies, and tweak the AI starting/recurring resources, to fine tune the game to your skills and tastes.
