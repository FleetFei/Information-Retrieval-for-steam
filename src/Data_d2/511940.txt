							A dreamlike glimpse into the visionary mind of Brooklyn-based artist and entrepreneur Stefan Pokorny, a classically trained art prodigy obsessed with Dungeons and Dragons. Follow Pokormy as he attempts to bring his most sprawling, ambitious work yet to life through Kickstarter, where he has raised over $6.4 million and given countless D&D devotees the dungeons of their wildest fantasies. If he is not successful this time around, he could lose the business he spent his entire life to build.
