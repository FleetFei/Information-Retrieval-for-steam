							“The Warden” is a first-person psychological-horror game with puzzles .Ephram Elias Barkley is a landowner who , after losing his family , lives his life in a alcoholic loneliness .His life is interspersed with moments of lucidity and states of trance that seem to leave, as  only trace, mysterious drawings of dark landscapes in which stands a big figure with deers horns… "Was always the same picture... a landscape with a river and a forest. The only difference was that the black figure seemed to be getting closer.Each time it was as if it had been drawed closer. Its outlines became lighter, and I glimpsed some horns, that I thought looked like deer's horns, on its head... From then on my memories fade and my mind starts to waver."
