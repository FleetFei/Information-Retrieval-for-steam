							ESSENTIAL REVISION FOR LEARNERS
A solid understanding of UK road signs and markings is essential if you want to pass the Theory Test and Practical Driving Test first time. 

NOT JUST FOR LEARNERS!
However, it's not just learners that need to brush up on their skills. How many times have you driven past a sign and wondered what it meant? 

Signs, signals and road markings play a key role in directing and informing traffic, so it's essential that we ALL know what they mean and how to safely respond to it.
