							About This Game
							Beglitched is a game about insecurity, in our computers and ourselves. In a pastel world of networks where nobody truly knows what theyâ€™re doing, hacking is a magical art and the notorious Glitch Witch is the most premium archmagi of the net. Through what appears to be nothing more than random circumstance, YOU are her new apprentice. You must use your wits and cunning to unravel the mechanisms of an alien computer and survive amongst a veritable web of clowns, leftclickers, and filedraggers.
