							About This Game
							Shatter Quest is an adventure set in a beautiful forest that has been invaded by an evil tree like monster. It has captured the peaceful creatures that live here and you must stop it. In order for you to defeat this tree monster, you must pass an increasingly difficult series of frozen walls that block your path.

A lone surviving angel is there to guide you on your quest and will provide you the means to break the frozen walls.

The game is a fun mix of tennis and break out but in an adventure style setting. Take care to make sure your playing area is clear of  ceiling lights and furniture near the edges of your chaperone bounds.
