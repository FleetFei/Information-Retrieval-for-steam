							About This Game
							There is a Fox in the ballroom! Or so the whispers from the other ballroom dancers suggest. Can the Flock trap the Fox before it is too late? Or will the Fox systematically eat all the other dancers before they even realize he is in their midst? Based on the puzzle game Fox & Geese, Fox & Flock is a dark, modernized version of Queen Victoria's favorite classic! Storyline, local multiplayer, and single player modes supported.
