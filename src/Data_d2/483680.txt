							Step into the Polydome. 

PolyDome is a musical environment that changes and progresses when you interact with it. Think of it as a sequencer, but rather than being a tool for creating music, it's a place where you can explore and create different musical phrases and sounds. The point of PolyDome is not to win, loose or compete, but simply to relax and enjoy.
