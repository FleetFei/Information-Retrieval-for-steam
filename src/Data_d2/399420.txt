							The Prism is a 2D puzzle platformer about two pixels, 02 and 03 lost inside a vast prison. Unlike a normal prison, this one is alive. It is called the Prism. Its eyes stare from a distance and watch its prisoners carefully, analyzing their actions and breathing down their necks. You will face many challenges but you don't have to do it alone. You can play by yourself or locally with a friend. 

The game holds many challenges and puzzles. Different elements and environments are added to create more unique situations using the abilities you have been given. As well as that, you will need to use each other as a means of getting past puzzles, opening doors and continuing your journey. The puzzles are challenging, the prism is dangerous and the world is cruel. It is possible to escape, but at what risk?
