							Gravity Island is a loveable, colorful platform game that will really put your skills to the test.  Shiro is an unbelievably cute, cuddly creature that loves collecting magical fireflies. One day, the magic lantern in which he kept his magnificent little creatures broke, and they all flew away. Shiro was heartbroken.

Without the magical Lumies, your powers to influence gravity will get weaker and weaker, and eventually disappear altogether.But this is more easily said than done. The Lumies are scattered all over magical Gravity Island, and cannot find their way home on their own. Help Shiro gather his little luminous friends in over 80 different levels, and use your powerful gravitation abilities to get through the trickiest levels unscathed.
