							One on One Adventures #9Legacy of DarknessAn adventure designed for 1 GM and 1 player (Level 8-10 Wizard)This module includes an adventure, complete with locations and maps, forming a ready-made adventure. It has been crafted for one GM and 1 player (Level 8-10 Wizard), although with some minor scaling, Legacy of Darkness is suitable for use with four 6th level player characters.Sehvain Malual is renowned for his work in necromancy, using the dark art to destroy the undead pestilence polluting the world. However every warrior must hang his proverbial sword and retiring from adventuring life, the wizened elf settled down in a nearby town purchasing a small townhouse. Here, he would finally find the peace he so craved, or such he hoped before he found The Black Lexicon. What dark intent consumes Sehvain’s time is anyone’s guess, but only the PC can uncover the Legacy of Darkness.Author: Creighton BroadhurstFantasy Grounds Conversion: Cari HarperRequirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Full or Ultimate license of Fantasy Grounds and the 3.5E (or compatible) ruleset.
