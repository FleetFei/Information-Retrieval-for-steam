							Bayla Bunny has discovered a book full of maps to magical treasures and loot, and sets out on an exciting adventure to discover them all. Energized and ready to explore, she takes off running and once she gets going, she rarely stops! Bayla Bunny offers a fun gameplay experience combining the best of platform- and runner-games, and your task is to control Bayla as she hops, runs, jumps, bounces, ducks, swings, rides and rocket herself through 27 challenging levels collecting coins, keys and treasure chests full of goodies. The faster you complete a level, the higher ranking you will achieve. But this is not an easy task â€¦ Obstacles will hinder your progress, and you will encounter enemies such as rowdy raccoons, pushy porcupines, raging bulls, evil mushrooms, crazy plants and frog kings all while avoiding flying arrows, rolling barrels, dancing fireballs, speedy cannonballs, pounding hammers and dangerous dynamite! Bayla Bunny is not only cute; it is a fun game suitable to anyone looking for an exhilarating platform experience full of rewards and surprises.
