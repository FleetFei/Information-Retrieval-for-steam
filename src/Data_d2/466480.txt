Remember the 90's when computer games were something incredibly hard to make? No Unreal Engine, no free assets no nothing. 
Rage Pig brings you to the times when indie was not so mainstream! 

Don't be fooled by nostalgic amateur look: Rage pig brings you hardcore experience and challenges your skills! 

If you loved games about stickmen (like Boring Man, for instance), you'll LOVE the beauty of Rage Pig experience.
