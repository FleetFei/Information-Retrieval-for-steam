							About This Game
							Timore Inferno is the 4th indie horror game in the Timore series. Strange visitors have come to a little girl's house, robbing her home and killing everyone inside... Except her. With dolls holding the anger of her loss, everyone who tries to go there and investigate what happened wind up missing.

Timore Inferno is a horror experience through the hell of a little girl's mind. The player meets a helper whom gives advise on how to stay alive, but it is ultimately up to you to decide whether to take it or not.
