							Any fleet during wartime needs a little support once in a while and if the enemy is at your gates, you’ll be glad to have the defensive foundation that only the Support ship can provide. Once you have ‘liberated’ an area on the map, you’ll want to keep it and fortify your position of dominance.  The Support ship will help you do just that. The support ship specializes in the construction of support structures. This ship allows you to reinforce control of the map by creating impregnable strongholds.SkillsRepair outpost:  Create a structure capable of repairing friendly battleships within rangeStealth field generator:  Create a structure for your allies to become stealthDefense turret:  Create a defensive structure capable of firing rockets at enemies in rangeMine:  Create a stealth mine inflicting enormous damage on nearby opponentsHeavy tower:  Build a heavy turret equipped with a strong shield generator and inflict heavy damage
