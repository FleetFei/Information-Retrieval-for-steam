Swift in tooth and claw, Felis attacks sunder the sky, armor and your opponents. With verve, fury and tenacity, Felis knows how to be patient when it comes to schooling opponents. Weaken? Never. Fail? Impossible! Even when mortally wounded, Felis can come back from the brink and punish his opponent!Felis regenerate health points when their health drop below a certain threshold.Strong as a rock, that’s the Gorok. But sensitive, too... To cracking and tearing and dismantling! The Gorok is a giant bruise-maker in a world of heavyweight louts. A heart of stone? Yes. But between a Gorok and his Drakoneer is an unbreakable bond. Your Gorok would do anything for you: dismember a few opponents, use their bleached skulls for drums, or fill up the arena with his molten battle-roar. Because that’s what Goroks do.Goroks hit harder whenever their fury is full.
