							The Hollywood Hills Mansion/HVR bundle from LOOT Interactive is the perfect place to unwind and escape reality. Enjoy breathtaking views of the Los Angeles skyline and immerse yourself in streaming entertainment on two large home theater screens, featuring live content from Facade TV*! Or, for the ultimate in freedom, side-load your own content. (Can be experienced with or without a VR headset.)

Bundled with the mansion are eight HVRs for your own incredible VR pool party!

Early Access pricing: the Hollywood Hills Mansion/HVR bundle is normally $17.99, but is available for a limited time for only $9.99!

Designed as a photorealistic immersion into the lap of luxury, the Hollywood Hills Mansion emphasizes the "being" of VR as much as doing. New features and experiences like streaming music, side loading and more are coming soon.

Please note: frame rate and performance may vary based on your computer setup.
