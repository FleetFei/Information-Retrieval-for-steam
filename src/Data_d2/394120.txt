							About This Game
							Atom Universe is a Free-to-Play social Virtual World: a theme park featuring fun people and fun things: plenty of games, rides and amusements, as well as advanced social interactions. 

Atom Universe is the best place to hang out: Everything you’ve ever loved about Fun Parks is here for you! From Carnival games like Coin Pushers, Shooting Galleries, Whack-a-Mole and Skeeball to big ones like Bowling, Mini Golf and Batting Cages, to the REALLY big ones - Ghost Trains, Rollercoasters and Karting.
And the BEST thing about Atom Universe is that you can do all of these things in the fine company of other people - bring friends along or come and meet lots of new ones! 

Atom Universe is first and foremost a hub for people to meet, chat and socialise. It’s essentially like a chatroom, but with loads of fun to have alongside. All of our games involve some sort of element of multiplayer, some competitive and some co-operative, so you will always find people to get involved with!

Constantly evolving and growing, offering more things to explore all the time, Atom Universe is the funnest place not on Earth!
