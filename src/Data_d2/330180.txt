							About This Game
							“In Pix the Cat, you are Pix, the first cat in the world to play his own game! Progress in the Grid of Infinity, deeper and deeper through its nested levels. Hatch the eggs to stack up ducklings behind you. Drop them off at target circles to set them free. Avoid hitting walls and obstacles at all costs! Still with me?” Developed by the French studio Pastagames, who created the excellent Rayman Jungle Run, Pix the Cat is a critically acclaimed intense arcade game that will challenge your reflexes and your wits, pitting you against your friends and the world in a race to the highest score! In the Arcade mode, make your way through the flashy digital levels, pulsing to a galvanizing groove that won’t fail to make your heart skip a beat or two! With art that feels dug up from an old attic, the Nostalgia mode is an adventure oozing with surprises! Each of the 70 levels offers a new skill challenge and yet another blister under your thumb! In the Laboratory, your results are measured by your number of moves. Keep them minimal while dodging dangers to collect the bonus stamp! Finally, joust against your friends in the local battle mode hosting up to four PixBots!
