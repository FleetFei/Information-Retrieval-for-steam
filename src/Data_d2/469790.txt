							About This Game
							Linelight is a refreshingly inventive, minimalist puzzle-adventure game. It takes the wildly simple premise of "What if everything takes place on a line?" and rockets it into outer space. Each mechanic is immediately understandable, then gradually combined with familiar elements, leading to an exponentially large array bursting with puzzles, each with a one-of-a-kind solution. There’s no jump button. There’s no shoot button. The way you move creates a universe of possibilities and one mind-bending experience. Guide Dash across the game’s rich, clean, and relaxing worlds; Linelight simulates the experience of getting an A+ on an exceptionally hard test while receiving a back massage. The gameplay is simultaneously unique and intuitive enough that gamers, non-gamers, your technology-illiterate relatives, tweens, rocket scientists, a potato with googly eyes and toothpicks for arms, and even line connoisseurs are all on the same playing field of challenge.* Welcome to the world of Linelight. *Okay, maybe not the potato.Key FeaturesBask in the soft glow of a world made out of straight lines.Experience 6 hours of pure, unadulterated gameplay.Solve more than 250 unique puzzles across 6 unique worlds.Enjoy a Zen-like, ethereal soundtrack, and enter a state of flow.Explore the intricacies of each world to uncover secret challenges.
