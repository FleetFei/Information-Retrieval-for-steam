The new story brings many innovations and new game elements for experienced as well for first time players, who will jump right into the fascinating medieval fantasy RPG scenario of Drakensang: The River Of Time.

Many mythical legends entwine around this river and will also flow into the main plot.

Depending on the choice of character, and behavior, new opportunities and series of quests will come up.
						Living on a ship, players will experience a broad variety of RPG quests. There will be two new character archetypes to play, tons of new foes and monsters as well as equipment items.
						Two new classes of heroes: the Geodes (rare Aventurian druids of the dwarfs) and the Gjalskerland inhabitants (tenacious and hard barbarians).
						Advanced expert mode and adjustable levels of difficulty.
