							About This Game
							An exciting, immersive puzzle platformer, 'Lectrovolt II' is a pixellated adventure about isolation, exploration and new beginnings. Deep in the rolling hills and clouded mountains of a land long forgotten, an plant invested remnant of a long-lost civilization has come to life, its centuries old rest has been disturbed. A software protocol, centuries old, has been re-activated and an artificial being, Lectrovolt, has been created. Explore and navigate the ruins of Erlis, from the military Core below the basement to the lofty Penthouse, solve intricate puzzles, upgrade Lectrovolt and charge larger and larger machinery to bring it to life, and fulfil your programming. Accompanied with a relaxing, deep soundtrack by Ketsa, a subversive secret lore and challenging achievements, 'Lectrovolt II' is the first ambitious Steam release by Harmonize Studios.======== UPDATE 1.2.9 - CHARACTER CHANGE PATCH ========
