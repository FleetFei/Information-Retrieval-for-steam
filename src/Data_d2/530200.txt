							When 3 college kids take a summer job it’s a chance of a lifetime to bartend at a bar in the middle of a lake!

This leads one of the college kids, Mike, a chance to finish up his summer thesis so he can actually graduate. He begins his research about the false accusations and sightings and bartends throughout the night. Unfortunately for them they miss the last boat off the island and are stuck trying to find a way off. As they do this they realize something is very different after hours. Without warning the kids have more than they bargained for because the Caretaker is coming….
