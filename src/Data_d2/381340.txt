							About This Game
							Mallow Drops is a gravity puzzle where two kiwis try to rescue their lost eggs in a shattered world. Turn everything upside down as you slide, shift and move through its tricky world, a mix of platformer and a sliding block puzzle. Getting to where you need to go is half the fun - just be sure to look before you leap! 

With Wooly Jumpers hopping about and Dirty Underbears surprising you suddenly, it won't be easy, and if you're not careful, the dreaded Dropbears may get the drop on you!
