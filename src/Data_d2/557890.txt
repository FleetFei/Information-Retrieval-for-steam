For years, Alex has been going for climbs, and trying to get Nic to join. Outdoor trips for her always meant renting a live-in recreational vehicle, but she’s leaving her comfort zone and do this one climb. It’s a chance for them to remember their lives together and know why this climb is so important. 

It features multiple scenes as they climb through different parts of the mountain to reach the summit. There will be an option to travel up a certain path during the experience, which provide different story elements between the characters.
