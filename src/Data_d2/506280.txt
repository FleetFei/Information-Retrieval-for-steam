							About This Game
							Before you lies your Donut. You can pull and twist it, snap and swish it. You have a whole arsenal of settings, presets and tools to play with. You can freeze it, relax it, save any contortion to be viewed later. You can even rip it apart so it returns to the void from which it came. Yet your Donut is still a being and you must show it respect. Make sure you caress it, and let it know that at the end of all this, you Know what it is, what it can become; all of its jiggles and imperfections. Build a relationship, because at the end, connection is the reason we are here.
