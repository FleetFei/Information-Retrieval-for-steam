							Naninights is a point-and-click horror adventure.You are working in a test lab, whose aim is to investigate and learn to control gifted children.Someone accidentally left a gate open and a test subject escaped. Track him using an A.L.I.F.A. mask and limit his ability to hunt you down. Use gates, cubes or mirrors corresponding to the attached rooms. Remember, there are few steps for Naninight to make in each room before he gets you. You are going to face 3 rounds consisting of 3 phases each, and 3 rounds on Hardcore to get to the truth. Spend power wisely, use the mirror and don’t lose your mind — it’s night time...
