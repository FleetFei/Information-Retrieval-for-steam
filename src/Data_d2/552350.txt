Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair.  Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand!  Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends.Features:*     Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate.*     Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood.*     A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another.*     An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests.*     An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge.*     Beautiful lands to explore.*     A coming of age story with meaningful character progression.*     Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities!*     A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night.*     14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin'*     Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp.*     Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.
