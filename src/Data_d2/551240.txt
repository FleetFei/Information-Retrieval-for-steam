							Savage Worlds Setting: SlipstreamSetting and Library Module for Fantasy GroundsUpdated on 12/17/11 to include a custom Slipstream, sci-fi skin and themeWelcome to SlipstreamSlipstream is a space pulp setting reminiscent of the black and white Saturday morning serials of the 1930s. Put aside all foolish thoughts of such things as the immutable laws of physics, Faster-Than-Light drives, and the hard vacuum of space, and revel in the rocketship and ray gun reality that governs Slipstream. If you're looking for a hard sci-fi game, you're reading the wrong book!Getting HereSlipstream is a pocket universe reached only by passage through a black hole. Every black hole in our universe has a branch tunnel to Slipstream. Conventional 21st century science has it that matter sucked into a black hole is destroyed; not even light can escape the terrible force of destruction. Well, conventional science isn't always right.What You Get:    GM library module    Player library module    Custom extension    56 New Edges which can be dragged onto characters or NPCs    18 New Hindrances which can be dragged onto characters or NPCs    Details on new gear: low-tech gear, high-tech gear, rocket ships, vehicles    New Psionics, New Races, Rules for generating your own races    A Gazeteer with detail on more than 50 worlds    Stats from more than 100 new personalities    17 Savage Tales and a Savage Tale Generator    Much moreRequires: An active subscription or a full or ultimate license and the Savage Worlds Ruleset.Fantasy Grounds Conversion: Kevin Doswell
