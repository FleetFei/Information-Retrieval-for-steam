							About This Game
							Vox-L is not a game.  It's a customizable virtual reality playground.By default, Vox-L is just an infinite white terrain.  There's nothing there.  You can't do anything fun.  Sounds boring, I know...But here are some reasons we think you'll enjoy it.Reason 1: It has free multiplayer.  You can invite your friends.  (If you have troubles starting a multiplayer game, we have a forum topic where we are discussing the multiplayer feature.  See the Basic Info section for a link to our forum.)Reason 2: It is customizable.  With free in-game apps, you can transform your playground into whatever you want.  Apps let you change the terrain, spawn toys, load dynamic content, launch mini-games, etc.Reason 3: We've already added several apps for you to customize your experience. Builder app: Gives you tools to deform the voxel terrain by placing/removing blocks (like in Minecraft).  Lets you spawn physical objects in the world. Multiplayer app: Host a server and invite your friends.  Or find and join a server. (NOTE: This feature is still in development.  If it doesn't work for you, please post on our support forum.) Worlds app: Choose from various pre-built worlds.  We currently have 3 voxel worlds.  We'll be adding over 100 more in early 2017. Flashlight app: Turn your tablet into a flashlight.  Control the color and brightness.  It's surprisingly fun. Sky app: Change the time of day, add fog, add clouds.  Reason 4: We are adding new apps constantly.  In fact, if you want to, you can make your own.  (NOTE: If you want to develop apps for Vox-L, contact us to be part of our developer Beta.  Anyone who knows JavaScript, HTML, and CSS can do it.)
