							Relive is a game about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it is also an adventure game. The main purpose is to increase the awareness about this topic and push people, especially teenagers and young adults, to take a CPR classes and be prepared to intervene in case of need.While the topic is serious, we tried to create a fun and entertaining game, a SCI-FI opera where players can enjoy their gaming experience while the CPR concept slips through the game. To move forward in the story and complete successfully Relive, you will need to learn the bases of CPR, in an interesting and non-invasive way.To keep the CPR skills razor sharp a tournament mode encourages group play. Family, schools and friends will be able to organize fast and fun CPR challenges and see who will be able to beat the best score.Why CPR?
In Europe every day 1.000 people die of cardiac arrest. If immediate CPR is performed, the chances of survival remarkably increase. In more than 70% of instances, cardiac arrest is witnessed and CPR could be initiated by bystanders. As of today, in Europe only in 15% of cases witnesses perform CPR (European average). Taking a CPR class is the best way to rise this 15% of bystanders and save lives with no additional risk.Is Relive really free?
Yes, Relive is completely free. The development of this game was made possible thanks to Future of Health Award, which purpose is to “bring serious gaming and healthcare together in order to contribute to more advanced healthcare across Europe“.
