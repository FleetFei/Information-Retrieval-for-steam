							About This Game
							Blast rocks, drill tunnels and force your way through every mountain. At the beginning you have enough time and no major problems. Once the TNT charges are placed you can start the blasting to create the tunnel entrance. The excavated material will be loaded by a shovel dozer on a dump truck and transported to the storage site. As soon as the entrance is cleaned up the huge tunnel drilling machine will march up. But this monster can only start operation if it is supplied with sufficient building material. This has to be delivered by crane and train. You have to steer all vehicles like the maintenance van, crane, tunnel drilling machine or the fire brigade. That’s how you’ll create the building site piece by piece before starting the tunnel itself. You’ll need to pay attention to many factors. The tunnel drilling machine has to be kept supplied with building materials. It’s important that you don’t lose track of your tasks. Frequent visits to your control room will be crucial.FeaturesDetailed scenery in 3D graphics  Intriguing, ongoing story Weather effects, day / night shiftVarious tasksLong lasting fun factorFree choice of the level, once you have accomplished all tasksIntuitive control via keyboard and mouse
