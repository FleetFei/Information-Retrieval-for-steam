							YANKAI'S TRIANGLE is a love letter to TRIANGLES. A puzzling puzzle game about the beauty and joy of infinitely tapping on TRIANGLES for some reason. With an elegant innovative revolutionary TRIANGLE-first approach to interface, YANKAI'S TRIANGLE lets you tap on TRIANGLES to spin them and stuff. Colors play a part in gameplay too I think. Bring TRIANGLES to a forgotten TRIANGLE, and uncover a TRIANGLE hidden deep beneath the YANKAI. Pretty Fun Gameplay (it's all right) No Filler - A Veritable Infinity of Meticulously Definitely Handcrafted TRIANGLES Over 1.74 x 10^26 Possible Levels (all definitely handcrafted) Color An Inscrutable Three-Pronged Scoring System A 'Happy Sounds' Option (woohoo!) A 'Colorblind' Option if You Are Colorblind (it's not great tbh) A Cool Film Grain Effect A Cool Tiled TRIANGLE Background Effect Also there are AchievementsA Game By Kenny Sun(YAN rhymes with KEN and KAI rhymes with EYE by the way)
