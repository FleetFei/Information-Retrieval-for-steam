							Heroes of Normandie: 21st Panzer Division is the second expansion for the acclaimed and fast paced tactical game Heroes of Normandie. Lead many new units from the tough german 21st Panzer Division and show those Yankees that you mean business! With 20 new units (including the Schwimwagen an amphibious vehicle!) and several new unit abilities this expansion is a must-have for every Heroes of Normandie fan, adding more depth and variety to an already amazing game.Features:20 new units! Powerful assault vehicles like the 2x Panther A, the Schwimwagen (it can pass through water areas! Just picture your enemy's face when you'll cross a river, shoot him, and then go back to the other side!), the Stug IV, the Stuh 42G, the Marder III, and many powerful infantry units.New unit traits: Heroic (units can activate a second time in the same turn), Hardboiled (units can discard a suppressed marker), Ace Driver (it decreases the Fire on the Move penalty of a vehicle of 1 point), Apc Shells (used by Tanks as firing bonus)A new hero! Whilhelm "ALV" Schelling!Firing Arc mechanic! Some special units (like two kinds of STUG and the new MARDER III) will have a devastating offensive power, but it comes with a cost: they are only able to shoot in front of them at an angle of 45 degrees.New recruitment tiles like the Panzergruppe are absolutely terrifying. Not only you can now have 2 Panthers at your disposal - one of them even gives you 2 additional orders!
