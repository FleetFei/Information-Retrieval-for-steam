a secret weapon is kept in the house. And with it help it will be able to rescue her father out of
trouble.
One day, lady Hildegard got message from her father. Here is what he wrote:
“Abigail, if you're reading this, then my fears have been realized. Talbot, my brother and your uncle,
has betrayed the family. He has succumbed to the Dark side and opened the Gates. Now all the evil
that our family has damned to eternity in the name of God and the Crown over the centuries shall
rise again. I implore you to be wise and take your rightful place as the head of the house of
Hildegard. And remember that you are not alone. The time has come to wake Adalar from his dream.
Your loving father, Aaron Hildegard.”
