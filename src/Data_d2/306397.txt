							It’s an endless struggle trying to please the people of Tropico – and this time El Presidente needs to go green in order to get out of trouble. Of course, this is all to protect the funds of his Swiss bank account – which are obtained through the simple method of exporting ludicrously large amounts of crude oil to competing superpowers.
