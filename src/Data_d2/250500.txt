							About This Game
							Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a fast-paced 2d shooting game with a random story. You control a group of three migrants traveling west along a wagon trail. The game consists of short scenes that are sequenced together in a semi-random way to tell a crazy adventure story. One minute you could be massacring a herd of buffalo, the next attacked by eagles while falling off a cliff.Features Stupidly fast. The scene changes every 3-30 seconds with some new enemy or obstacle to overcome. Face bears, snakes, spiders, buffalo, avalanches, sharks, and more! Random. The scenes you play are sequenced together in a semi-random way, so you never know which dangers you will face. Rare and bizarre events provide extra surprises. Unlockable wagons. New wagons with special weapons and characteristics are awarded for completing challenging tasks and surviving rare events. Customize your party. You pick your party membersâ€™ names and appearances. Name them after your friends and then watch them die one by one in brutal ways. A true challenge. There are no checkpoints or save games. When a party member dies, they stay dead.
