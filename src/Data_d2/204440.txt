							About This Game
							Get ready for the ultimate treasure hunt!  Your shop, Rusted Gold, has shelves to fill, auctions to run, and money to make—and you can only do that with the best finds.
							Check out the dozens of locations from run-down farms to back road antique shops to abandoned storage units to see if you can stumble upon your next great treasure.  What do you do once you’ve found something?  Shine it up or sell it as is to see if you can turn a profit, or if you hit bust.  Haggle with crazy characters as you try to build your reputation for having the best picks around and learn more about what makes each person tick.  Consult with an expert to avoid being hoodwinked!  Combine items to increase their values and learn how to increase your odds along the way.
							Price your picks to sell them in your shop, or take your chances on the auction block to see if you can make an even bigger profit!
