							About This Game
							Outland is a fast-paced, dynamic platformer where the player uses powers of light and dark in an epic journey to save the world from forces of chaos.

In-between Balance and Chaos stands one man, whose efforts will either bridge the ancient divide or doom the world to destruction. Outland is an ambitious 2D-platformer with a beautiful visual style and a unique, polarity-switching gameplay system. Your adventure will shift between light and darkness as you struggle to adapt in an ever-changing world!
