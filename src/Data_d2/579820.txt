							A RICH WORLDExploring from a first-person perspective, gamers will encounter an array of dinosaurs and creatures that react to their presence within the ecosystem of Tyson III. An emphasis on interaction with their surroundings encourages players to examine each area of the game in detail – creating a dense atmosphere and adding to the sense that Tyson III is a goldmine of undiscovered secrets. The game places narrative at the center, with an engaging storyline unfolding as players explore. AN EXPLORER’S PARADISEThere’s something to discover around every corner. Wander off the beaten path to collect achievements, find rare items, and interact with the environment. With free movement, you can go wherever you want, choose how to progress, revisit places, and make the most of a non-linear story.
