							About This Game
							Create a room for your friends or join one already in progress and kill new friends. Game modes include Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. The action is fast, and luckily, so are the respawns. Up to 24 players per room makes for a kill frenzy! Use your rocket launcher to blow open secret passageways or to block off access. There are currently 6  different sprawling maps to cater to multi-player mayhem – each with their own distinct advantages and tactical requirements. Keep your friends close, and opt for a round of Team Deathmatch. Or truly keep your enemies closer, and trust no one in an all out every-man-woman-and-child-for-themselves game of true Deathmatch – where no one is safe from that grenade you just heard getting primed. The new Capture The Flag mode is CTF with a twist. Your team gets points for capturing the flag as well as blowing away the enemy!New Features, Achievements, and Maps are currently in the works, and regular updates are planned leading up to the full release of Second Coming: The Annakazi Invasion!Don't forget to vote for Second Coming:The Annakazi Invasion also here on Greenlight - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235945780
