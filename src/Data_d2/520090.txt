							About This Series
							The amateur filmmakers of Devolver Digital present Behind the Schemes, a new take on the traditional behind-the-scenes series. Each episode in the series aims to uncover the spirit of each game through intimate conversations with the personalities behind them and exploring the tiny apartments, humble offices, and vibrant cities where they are made.

Episode one takes viewers behind the red silk curtain of Paris, home of Le Cartel, the lo fi team behind bruising Soviet-era brawler Mother Russia Bleeds. Later episodes will include visits to Warsaw, Seville, and LA as Devolver gets its hands dirty under the hoods of Shadow Warrior 2, Crossing Souls, and Strafe, with more to follow. Grab your popcorn and get comfortable.
