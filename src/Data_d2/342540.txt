Set in the near future where virtual reality has become the ultimate escape to the dreariness and suffering of everyday life in a collapsing society you will use your wits, computer skills, and hacking ability to discover the mystery behind the recent disappearances. This investigation leads you to infiltrate her last known location where you become entangled in a conspiracy that spans both virtual and physical realities. Do you have what it takes to find your sister and help her before it is to late? 

The initial concept of this game was created by a published author in the hacking world. The story has been written by Conor Kostick - Published Sci-Fi author and Historian.
