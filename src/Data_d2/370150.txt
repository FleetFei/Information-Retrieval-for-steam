							About This Game
							LOOP is a tranquil puzzle game, with a unique, simple, meditative feel.

Now includes a level generator with a possible 1 BILLION levels.

Complete each level by swapping the hexagon pieces until all the lines link up, revealing the final pattern.

Later levels introduce spinning pieces and colour changing pieces also!

Inspired by Zen philosophy, the minimal UI has no timers, move limit or score; allowing you to just relax and focus.

Includes 100 Levels and a colour blind mode.
