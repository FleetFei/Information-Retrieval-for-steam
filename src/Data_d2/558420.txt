							About This Game
							“Stories Untold” is a narrative-driven experimental adventure game, that bends the genre into something completely unique. Combining a mix of classic text-adventure, point-and-click and more, 4 short stories are packaged together into a single mysterious anthology that has been described as “a fantastic, fascinating example of interactive visual storytelling”  (Telegraph 5/5) and earning widespread critical acclaim since release.
 
The game pulls together 80s retro nostalgia, innovative and experimental genre-defying gameplay, and tense, phycological horror to create “one of the most fascinating and unique tales you can play this year” (GameSpew 9/10). 

The first Episode “The House Abandon” is now available for free via a demo, to give you a glimpse of what is in store in the full game.
