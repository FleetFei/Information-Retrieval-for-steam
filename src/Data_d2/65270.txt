Includes Demolition Company, the DLC Kit Pack PLUS brand new equipment, new missions and a HUGE new city district 4 times bigger than the old Demolition Company districts! In a city where buildings are constructed as rapidly as they are torn down again, you get to take control of a demolition company which is growing bigger and going places. Lots of challenging missions lead you to various demolition sites in different districts of the city, where you can use your special vehicles and equipment to demolish buildings, complete missions and earn cash.						Take a seat at the controls of a variety of authentic and detailed construction and demolition machines. Bring old buildings to the ground with wrecking balls and excavators. Tear down walls manually with the jackhammer, or place explosive charges, hit the button and watch the rubble and dust clouds fly!
