He is the first to hear the signal, a distress call from the stars that answers the ultimate question once and for all: we are not alone.The Commonwealth of Man is divided by his discovery. Some see it as salvation for their dying world, others insist that answering the call will expose them to advanced alien species and a future of slavery in their thrall. Some are willing to go to extreme lengths to make sure that doesn’t happen.The first mission is a catastrophic failure, huge ark ships burning in the skies over Unity Prime. The brightest and best—scientists, warriors, historians—are all lost in the fires.
