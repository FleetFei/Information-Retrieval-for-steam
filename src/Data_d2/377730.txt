There are cracks in the world. They’re slender, dark, and often cold, but they are the only things that keep you hidden. Keep you alive.
They are the shadows of the world, and they are where you live. You are a shadowrunner, thriving in the margins, doing the jobs no one else can. You have
no office, no permanent home, no background to check. You are whatever you make yourself.


Shadowrun, 5thEdition is the newest version of one of the most popular and successful role-playing worlds of all time—a fusion of man, magic and machine in a
dystopian near-future. With rules for character creation, magic, combat, Matrix hacking, rigging, and more, you have everything you need to face the challenges of the Sixth World.
