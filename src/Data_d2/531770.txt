							The complete Nurburgring experience!

The Nurburgring 'old' Nordscheife is a mecca for motorcyclists, and this film shows why thousands of bikers challenge the 'Ring themselves every year.

Join us with a group of superbike riders on an Advanced Riding Course to learn how to ride the 'Ring at speed. Then enjoy some great archive footage as we take a look at some of the great Nurburgring races of the past.

These include Geoff Duke's victory on the Gilera in 1955, Giacomo Agostini giving the fabulous MV Agusta its last ever GP win in 1976 and Kenny Roberts clinching world titles in 1978 and 1980.

Finally, we take you on an unforgettable ride with Helmut Dahne on one of the fastest laps of the 'Ring' ever recorded by on-bike camera.
