							What is Angels of Fasaria?: Angels of Fasaria was originally released in 2005. With thousands of downloads and over 48 thousand active users in the browser based game, Angels of Fasaria maintained a loyal following and support base. After the release of "Fasaria World" and later the "Ancients of Fasaria" mmorpg, Angels of Fasaria RPG and the browser based game community was closed and discontinued. After popular demand and by player's request, we submitted Angels of Fasaria on Greenlight and the community voted it in. It is now re-released on Steam, back and fully revised.
