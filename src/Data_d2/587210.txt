							About This Game
							As a skull master, your ambition is to conquer the land with your army of the dead. You could summon skeletons and make them fight for you. They seem to be loyal and fearless. But they are not as strong as you thought...

Deploy your army to siege castles controlled by human force. You could equip them with sword, shield, spear or other weapons. Your soldiers' are fragile. Their bodies may fall apart themselves before they cut down your enemies. 

The main idea of this game is to make you laugh. I played many games. Some of them just make players exhausted without having fun. And games are becoming more and more complicated these years. I even need to read a dictionary before I play some RPGs. So how about amusing ourselves. Return to Famicom times and enjoy the game simply. That's why my friends and I made this one.
