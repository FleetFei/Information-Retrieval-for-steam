You play Ryker: the only surviving human colonist after your people were wiped out by local aliens. Now you’re stranded on Asteria, with no means of escape. This isn’t just about survival, it’s about revenge. Build your safe haven and go track down the aliens who destroyed your colony.Key Features9 Hand Crafted Dungeons to Discover and ConquerRanged Mining and Fighting100+ Items Over 9 Tiers of Gear900 Slot “Hypercube of Holding” Inventory with Unlimited Stack AmountsFull Mod Community SupportCreative ModeMultiplayer!
