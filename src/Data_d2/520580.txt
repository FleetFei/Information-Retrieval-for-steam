							I always had a problem when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up; I never knew what to say. I would have said astronaut, but I knew that the food was awful. I eventually started saying ‘architect’, which led to a university course and a good grounding in many design skills, but my heart was never really in it. What I didn’t know then, and I didn’t realise until recently, was that the very thing I wanted to do to make a living didn’t even exist at the time. It might not even exist now. 

This is the story of the trainee wizard Slightly; how he came to be, how he almost disappeared forever, and how he returned after 25 years.

Written by Slightly's original creator, the book also showcases the artwork of Chris Graham. 

Slightly Magic was a successful 90's computer game written by Colin Jones, author of Rock Star Ate My Hamster. Initially released on the ZX Spectrum, the game was published on a number of 8bit and 16bit formats.
