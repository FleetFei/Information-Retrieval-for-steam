When you need a bit of practice before going against real players we have bots to fill games with so you can hone your skills or just get a feel for a new map.Four different classes distill different play styles of the game. You can be a careful sharpshooter, or a mad gunman running around and confusing the enemy. Each class wants to counter another and choosing the right class will always give you an upper hand in a fight. The Tactician can blow your enemies away with his shotgun, while the fast firing Flanker than can get up close and personal and unload lots of bullets. The Marksman is the man of accuracy, a tough class to play but can deal devastating amount of damage. The Trooper is the jack of all trades, able to fit into many situations, but might not be ideal when pressured.Competitive movement based twitch shootingComedic and stylized graphics powered by Unreal 410 Unique dynamic maps4 Game ModesOnline, LAN or split screen multiplayer along with complex AI to compete with!Four classes representing different possible play styles
