							Baezult 2 is a puzzle platformer that takes place around the ancient temples of Baezult, lost for generations but rediscovered, hidden behind the waterfalls of a reclusive jungle island. It's a single player game and the sequel to Baezult.

The original Baezult was released in October of 2014 and the sequel has some obvious improvements, such as better graphics (The original only using 16 colors) and a non-static camera. This hasn't heavily impacted the gameplay and the game still feels the same but better. with many more types of puzzles and elements that you will just have to find out and see for yourself.
