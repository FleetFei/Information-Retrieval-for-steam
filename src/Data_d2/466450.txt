							About This Game
							In Bootleg Systems, you play agent Logan Blake, a member of the dystopian society our world has become at the dawn of the 23rd century. 

In a time where humans can no longer conceive and maintain their corporal envelopes, humanity is forced to transfer their knowledge and conscience to machines. A worldwide artificial intelligence program is put in place to preserve our ideas and legacy until a solution to humanity's subsistence is found. 

One day, a breach in the system occurs, allowing rogue agents to clone its data and create new systems used to serve alternative purposes. Your responsibility is to investigate these illegal systems, take possession of their intel, and shut them down to restore order.
