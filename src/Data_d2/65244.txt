							Running from Sheffield to Manchester via the rugged landscape of the Pennines, the Woodhead Line was electrified way back in the early 1950s with the Class 76 electric locomotive being built especially for the line. A major feature of the route is the Woodhead Tunnel system, comprising three tunnels (the third being added specifically for the electrification of the line) to enable the line to run through the hilly landscape of the northern Peak District. The Class 76 electric locomotive was first produced as a prototype (6701) in 1941, with full production beginning in 1950 in Manchester. Under British Rail, Class 76s hauled freight and passenger services along the Woodhead Line until 1970, after which they handled only freight workings. Now closed to traffic since 1981, the Woodhead Line and its tunnels are still a regular destination for rail enthusiasts and hikers, and they have now been brought back to life in Train Simulator.Key Features60-mile Woodhead Line route from Manchester Piccadilly to Sheffield Victoria including Wath branch and Woodhead TunnelsClass 76 electric locomotiveClass 08 diesel shunter in BR Black8F Steam LocomotiveMk1 coaches in crimson livery Download size 842 MBScenarios7 scenarios, including career and standard, plus 4 free roams	In the Bleak Midwinter (Standard)	I`ve Never Known a Night Like It (Standard)	Run for Your Wath (Standard und Karriere)	The Hadfield Flyer (Standard und Karriere)	The North Country Continental (Standard und Karriere)	To Lincoln Central (Standard und Karriere)	Up the Junction (Standard)	Plus 4 free roams More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
