Let's run a little Q&A session!WHAT HEROES ARE INCLUDED?Tony TurrettoTony's your man when it comes to defending home base, but he don't mind playing out of position if his crew need him to crack heads and redefine the front line. With turrets, fire traps and a hero special that increases build speed, Tony is not just a base builder - he is THE base builder. The Ace of Base... Sarge Stone:He ain't the brightest but he sure is one of the toughest. Sarge loves to blow things up - so much so we think he needs to see someone about it. Rocket launchers, grenades and C4 - if it explodes, Sarge has access to it. Nigel Purdey-LongshottFrom a forgotten corner of the old empire comes a skilled marksman, expert trapper and gentleman. The master of battlefield awareness, Nigel's spotting ability, Tiki Heads and long rifle means he can control a huge area - and by control, we mean shoot enemies in the face as they wonder how they were seen.
