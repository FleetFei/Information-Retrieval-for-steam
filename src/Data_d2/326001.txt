							First operational before the Civil War, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was familiar to generations of Americans right up to its disappearance in 1987. Like many other old railroad names, the B&O did not cease business but was swallowed up by mergers, becoming part of Chessie System and hence folded into the modern-day CSX Transportation railroad. 
The B&O Wagon Pack includes the following rail vehicles in B&O livery:
BO Boxcar 40ft
BO Boxcar 50ft
BO Caboose I-12
BO Flatcar (cable load)
BO Flatcar (log load)
BO Flatcar empty (two versions)
BO Flatcar (pipe load)
BO Flatcar (tarp-covered load)
