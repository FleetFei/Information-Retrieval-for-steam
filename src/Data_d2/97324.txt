							Ajani Goldmane’s fully unlocked “Auramancer” white and green deck. A native of the Naya shard of Alara, Ajani Goldmane was once solely focused on revenge for his brother’s murder. This led him into a tangle of intrigue woven by mysterious forces, and Ajani’s been forced to broaden his skills as a warrior. Some creatures in this deck start out impressively large, but beefed up by a few enchantments and they become colossal.
