About the developer

Hi, I'm Ludvig Larsson, a Swede in France and creator of Mindoki games.
I have always been attracted to the video game universe and quickly I understood that gaming wasn't the only thing I liked so I started my career as a game developer and game designer in Paris.
After ten years programming and designing video games (Quest for alliance, Ghost force, Speed Addict underground, Bubble Soccer, plus another 15-20) I decided to go indie so I worked in the classic industry daytime and in the rest of the time on my games: Mindoki (which is now my company name but was a fully working 3D MMORPG), Metamorphes.com (a turnbased web-MMO), a lot of prototypes..., and finally, a Family of Grave Diggers.

As the game came along nicely, I decided to go full time indie (since April 2015) and it works really well!

• Release dates

Barring disasters, the full release is planned for Q1 2016
