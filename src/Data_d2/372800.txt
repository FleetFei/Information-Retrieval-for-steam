Players can build up combat and magic skills and acquire spells, weapons and armor to become formidable fighters, and they also may build up crafting skills and create items for themselves or for sale to others. The game is an open-world sandbox experience where players may choose their own road, and a key component of gameplay is a vibrant player market where any object may be sold to other players. It is a true free-to-play game; even the most desirable items can be acquired from other players with in-game currency that is built up through gameplay. RPG MO is created with adult gamers in mind, and progress into higher levels will not come quickly. Younger players also may enjoy gameplay, particularly if they are willing to be patient and develop skills.RPG MO Includes:   Explore 25 hand crafted beautiful pixeled large worlds   Explore randomly generated dungeons with up to a 4 player party   Fight monsters   Fight other players in many different modes - guild wars, RSC-wilderness like map, last man standing arena   Level up 15 different skills with no level caps   Build your own house and invite your friends over for a party   Choose or breed yourself a pet from our 160+ pets   Become a collector and try to get all our 1450+ itemsFollow Us On Twitter Https://twitter.com/rpgmo
