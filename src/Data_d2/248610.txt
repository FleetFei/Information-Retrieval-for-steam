							Door Kickers is an innovative realtime strategy game that puts you in charge of a SWAT team and lets you command them during a tactical intervention. Analyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.It may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, thatâ€™s a skill harder to master.Quick Points:2D, Top Down for optimal tactical analysisReal Time With Free PauseNo turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfacesRealistic but action packedNon-linear levels, freeform gameplayMission editor and modabilityUnlimited gameplay via mission generator and level editorSingle Player (but MP might come later)Read more about the game at http://www.doorkickersgame.com
