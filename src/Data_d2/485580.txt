							About This Game
							24 hours have changed the world altogether. The gates to the Hell have opened. The city where yesterday the sun shone and the life throve has drowned in the darkness.
Demons have swarmed the streets, forests and fields.The fear and atrocities reign. The peoples are in captivity of the demons.
You, the unfrightenable marine, managed to escape. And now you have decided to face this horror to return the light in this world and save the people.
With only very SMG you will fight in full darkness. You should be tiptoe and stealthy to avoid demons attention. Your way will be through dark forests, a dungeon to the center of the city where the evil dwells. Defeat the evil and save the people.
