							'This looks like the most terrible mix of differing types of gameplay. I must have it!' - RPS CommenterAn authoritarian state pacifying the masses with propaganda. A brutal police force that shoots first then shoots some more.An ordinary everyman named Eugene, dragged by coincidence and circumstance from a life of mundane menial tasks into a baffling world of sudden, inexplicable murder, hidden conspiracy and unrelentingly lethal robots with nasty sharp pincers and lasers coming out of everywhere.Depicted in a distinctive Cyrillic pixel art style the cyberpunk city crackles with tech-noir intrigue and neo-digital deceptions. Using every tool at your disposal help Eugene to unpick the knot of mystery that he has become enmeshed within â€“ your equilibrium will be rocked as you point and click a path through this briar patch of tangled meaning and unexpected quixotic quirks.Will Eugene make sense of the conundrum that unfolds before him, learn who is an ally or a foe and collect lots of vinyl records for his listening pleasure? He'll race rapid hover bikes to earn sub-cultural respect, rub shoulders with high society in a post-modern nightclub, hack the brains of pursuing drone cops in thrill-packed chase sequences, strive to survive tense shootouts with merciless law enforcers and enjoy some 8-bit cowboy coin-op action in a dingy dive bar with a broken toilet.Multiple endingsUnique blend of action, point and click and RussiaGet fingered for murderSoviet Bloc Edition contains DreamBreak game with good Russian stuffs like:Original 19 track soundtrack recorded by Egor Gritsukov (.mp3 & .wav)Digital art book (.pdf)Pack of 5 WallpapersWalk-through (yeah good luck with that!) in Russian and 'English' (.pdf)
