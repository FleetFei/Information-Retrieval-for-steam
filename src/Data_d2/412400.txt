							About This Game
							This game takes place in the same universe as our upcoming tittle Secluded; you take control of a lone astronaut that lands on the surface of a planet, miles away from the other members. And itâ€™s your job to meet up with the other astronauts. 

This game is based on constantly moving, as your suit leaks oxygen at random times. You must also avoid hazards that accrue on the planets, such as falling debris and asteroid strikes. This game is Free to play and experimental in some ways. We want the player survive in their own way and not have the game hold their hand through the experience, the games objectives are randomized so the locations change each time you play, and once you die that's it.
