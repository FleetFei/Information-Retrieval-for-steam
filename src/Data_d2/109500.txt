							About This Game
							A heroic rooster sets forth on a ridiculous space adventure to DESTROY THE SUN! Unfortunately for him, a legion of lingerie-loving Vikings has turned it into their headquarters and they’re big fans of fried chicken. Full of high tech weaponry, constant non sequitur, terrible gaming humor and a wanton disregard for anything wholesome; Fowl Space is a crazy journey you’ll never forget... to say the least.

 Key Features

5 insane weapons including exploding kittens, unspecified white goo, and a killer whale flail.
5 stages of complete and utter randomness in the center of the sun.
9 challenge levels that are homages to other awesome indie games.
Terrible gaming humour and relentless abuse of memes throughout.
