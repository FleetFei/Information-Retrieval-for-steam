							VOX POPULI, the first free DLC from Wargame AirLand Battle, has been developed specifically to respond to the demands of the community… and has just landed with a whole arsenal of new features!“CONQUEST” mode makes a great comeback in Multiplayer mode and against the AI, offering a range of new objectives to commanders all over the world. Unlike DESTRUCTION mode, victory in CONQUEST doesn’t depend on the destruction of the enemy forces, but on your ability to capture and hold more territory than your opponent. All the existing maps in Multiplayer are of course playable in this mode.In addition to this new game mode, CAMPAIGN, already playable in Versus mode, is now available in CO-OPERATIVE mode and allows you to join forces with a friend to play any campaign against the AI. In Skirmish mode you can now select the type and nationality of the equipment of any AI opponent. Last but not least, we have introduced 24 new units and 5 new maps (playable in Destruction and Conquest modes) for even more frenzied multiplayer contests!Play the brand new CONQUEST modeCAMPAIGN mode playable as a Co-op game5 new Multiplayer maps24 new units (12 per faction): 6 aircraft, 7 infantry units, 9 vehicles/tanks, 2 helicoptersSelect the type and nationality of the equipment of any AI opponent in Skirmish mode
