							About This Game
							A Word to the wise: BETTER PACK AN ANVILYou are Drew Blanc, animator of The Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show.  Life hasn't exactly turned out the way you planned.  Your boss, Mr. Schmalz, has it in for you. Your creativity has left town.  And just when you think it can't get worse...  it does.  A freak accident involving electronics (don't ask) spins you headfirst into the WHACKED OUT and not-so-warm-and-fuzzy world of your own cartoon creations. To get home, you'll need to unravel the secrets of these loony lands before they unravel you.  Out smart demented clowns, out shock cross-dressing livestock, and outwit the diabolical Count Nefarious!  Send someone an exploding turkey.  Watch Spike the Clown torture balloon animals.  And, if you've got any energy left, try preventing an all-out war between the cartoon forces of good and evil.  Toonstruck  stars Christopher Lloyd and features Ben Stein, as well as the voice talents of Tim Curry, Dan Castellaneta and Dom DeLuise!
