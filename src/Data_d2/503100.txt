Explore complex levels filled with hidden dangers and work together to survive.Couch Co-op + Local MultiplayerPlay with your friends on one computer.

At this point there’s no support for online play.Hacking SuperpowersSpice can use a hacking terminal to unlock special doors and freeze or blind enemies. But these superpowers require teamwork. Hammer must collect in-world “bits” and scan enemies to enable hacking.12 Challenging LevelsEach level is crawling with robot agents including the grunt, captain, king, or the hunter, who can sniff out your trail and chase you down.
