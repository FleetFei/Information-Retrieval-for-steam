A modern multi-player take on the classic space combat genre of the 1990's, Moon Breakers delivers thrilling gameplay with simple controls that will have you flying and shaking bandits off your six in minutes. Coupled with a bold, retro-futuristic art style, amazing music by Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica, The Walking Dead) and a variety of ships to unlock and upgrade, Moon Breakers is pure space combat awesome. Sign up, climb in and get ready for launch... there are fortunes to be made.
