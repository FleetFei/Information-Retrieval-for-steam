To forward the space exploration, a private group of companies started comprising the Consortium. The Consortium was able to demonstrate amazing success within a few decades. It quickly assumed a monopoly position in the development and production of space equipment. During this time mankind overcame the differences it had and united to a world government in 2087.

The first success of the new world government was the establishment of a permanent mars colony in 2094. The Consortium took actively part in. Today it’s the year 2169. Mankind has long since penetrated to the farthest corners of the solar system. A gold rush has set up mining colonies whereever it has been possible to mine raw materials. The Consortium has thus developed into the largest economic power in the solar system. It controls a large part of all mining operations and earns revenue from the sale of ships and technology to the colonies.

The huge distances between the planets make it extremely difficult to the Military to retain control.
