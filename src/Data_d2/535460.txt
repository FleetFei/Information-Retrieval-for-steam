							About This Game
							This is a VR experience which shows how virtual reality can invoke an involuntary response. I created the first scene - the canyon - as I wanted to demonstrate the effect to friends without having to guide them through a game to a suitable point. It was so effective I wanted to expand on it. This is very much aimed at being an experience you can keep in your library and bring out to show new users - it isn't a game so there aren't any challenges in it, and will have less effect on veteran VR users.The current stationary scenes are:A wooden bridge over a canyonA narrow ledge on a cliffThe top of a building in a cityBeing in a dark passageway with only a flip lighterBeing trapped underground with the walls closing inIn the ocean surrounded by sharksOn a window cleaning gondola on the side of a skyscraperThere are also scenes which include player movement:Performing a base jumpSwinging round a city with grappling hooks
