							Here's the soundtrack -- hope you guys enjoy it! It contains about 36 separate tracks (with a bonus piano theme not played in the game), although some of them are just short cues. I'd say the OST to A Bird Story is more meticulously fitted compared to To the Moon -- it has more carefully time-matched themes as opposed to ones that continuously loop.
