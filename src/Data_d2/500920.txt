							About This Game
							The latest release of Indie game House of Alice is now available on Steam! Unlike many VR games, this virtual bunny hunt starts out in a beautiful real-looking house. You can pick up vases and candlesticks and throw them around for an exciting crash or chase after the rabbits to collect points. Like Alice in Wonderland, this family-friendly game explores shifting perspectives of large and small and you can jump through the looking glass for surreal adventures.

Discover a rabbit hole to uncover new scenes and characters both inside and outside the house. This game keeps expanding so if you havenâ€™t been in recently, it is time to go back.

House of Alice is a good family game and a great way to experience Virtual Reality in a relaxed atmosphere. I hope you enjoy it and if you have ideas for things to add, please drop me a line.
