							About This Game
							Developed in America and first released in 1981, Ms. PAC-MAN finally comes to Steam!
Move Ms. PAC-MAN up, down, left, and right to eat all the Pac-Dots, while avoiding the ghosts, to advance to the next stage.
Eat a Power Pellet to turn the tables on the ghosts and rack up a huge score!

The basic rules are the same as PAC-MAN, but with an additional Warp Tunnel and other features, Ms. PAC-MAN truly shines as its own game!

This latest port comes with scanline and sound settings - perfect for Ms. PAC-MANiacs!
With her trademark ribbon, it's not hard to see the adorable charm of Ms. PAC-MAN!
