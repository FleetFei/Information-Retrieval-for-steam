							About This Game
							As of 2016, MyDream is on development hold. We have no details on when work will resume, and in what capacity, but our efforts are currently focused on Siege Hammer. 

MyDream is a sandbox game that combines grid-based building with organic and fully-deformable voxel terrain. Build, terraform, quest, and explore your way across various environments in beautiful and expansive worlds!
