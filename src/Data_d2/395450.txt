							For those that wandered into the deep void of I Can't Escape and enjoyed the offset of moments it gave you, can now enjoy being engrossed in the sequel,  I Can't Escape: Darkness.  I Canâ€™t Escape: Darkness, developed by Fancy Fish Games,  is an immersive atmospheric horror adventure game that invites the player to explore an unknown paradox full of conspiracies and danger.My challenges for this album was not only to write better music than I did two years ago but to constantly fuel the inspiration I needed to make the immersion effective . New things that differ from the first album are voice manipulation techniques, live instruments, singing,  binaural mixing procedures, and non-linear music.So many ideas went into making this soundtrack that instead of describing it more, I challenge you to play the game, try to escape and get lost in the darkness.Tracks Included:Enigmatic (00:22 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 1st Floor - Faith (02:06 mp3 128kbps)Corpses (00:19 mp3 128kbps)Combat (01:16 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 2nd Floor - Liminality (03:05 mp3 128kbps)Ambiguity (00:16 mp3 128kbps)Mushroom Grove (00:25 mp3 128kbps)Discovery (02:54 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 3rd Floor - Ritual (00:33 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 3rd Floor - Unwelcomed (01:26 mp3 128kbps)The Darkness Descends (03:56 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 4th Floor - Nebulous (02:06 mp3 128kbps)Tree of Peace (03:39 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 5th Floor - Reaggregation (01:50 mp3 128kbps)Heart Room (00:35 mp3 128kbps)Right of Passage 5th Floor - Cognitive Claustrophobia (01:03 mp3 128kbps)Traitor!
