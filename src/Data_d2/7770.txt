					                        The Place: America - early 21st century

					                        Alien forces have invaded Earth and are terrorizing the population. To combat this sinister threat, a lone X-COM scientist has created the Enforcer, a high-tech fighting machine made of earthly robotics and scavenged alien technology.                                                
					                        Armed with the latest high-powered weapons, the Enforcer is sent into alien hot spots to fight in adrenaline-charged battles that rage on city streets, across rooftops and in the sewers. YOU are the Enforcer.                                                
					                        Powered by the same game engine as Unreal Tournament™, X-COM ENFORCER™ puts you on the front line of an alien attack.
