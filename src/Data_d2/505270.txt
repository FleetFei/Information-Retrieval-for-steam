							About This Game
							Cakes, pizzas, cookies, burgers, ice cream......now that we have your undivided attention, welcome to The Food Run - a colourful, classic puzzle game with a few tasty twists! The aim of each puzzle is simple - all you have to do is eat everything you can see on the screen. Unfortunately you'll find that once you set off in a certain direction to commence eating, you just can't stop (just like in real life)! You'll also have to contend with lots of weird and wonderful objects that will help or hinder your progress on the way to ultimate gluttony. The Food Run contains 64 unique puzzles across eight themes. Each level has a star rating from one to three, with three stars only being awarded for completing a puzzle in the lowest possible number of moves. The Food Run is addictive, nutritionally-balanced and deliciously difficult!
