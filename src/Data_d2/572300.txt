							About This Game
							A lethal pandemic swept through the globe, mutating vermin into an aggressive menace and threatening to snuff out the light of humanity. Now my children, the survivors of the disease are rising back up, unwilling to let me become a hollow shell on the coast." - The city of NyheimNyheim is a game of risk management and rolling dice. In Nyheim you will gather a group of survivors, each contributing one or more eight-sided dice to the party. When you rest or explore in a location, you roll the dice and attempt to get the results that cards in the location require. Food, items and skills will grant you rerolls and ways to manipulate the dice, while injuries, threats and hardships will reroll them when you don't want to or remove them altogether!Your ultimate goal is to survive through the winter, gather enough population, or rebuild Nyheim's hydroelectric dam. Crises, threats and ever-looming threat of starvation will make the road to victory harsh and unforgiving.
