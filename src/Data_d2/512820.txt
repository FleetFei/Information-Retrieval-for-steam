							This session allows you to jump in and drive the CN GP9 Phase I and II locomotives in easy or realistic mode. This is a 'Free Drive' session only giving you instant access to drive the locomotives.

For further gameplay you can create your own sessions in Surveyor using these locomotives. Find them under the Trains Tab by searching for 'CN' in Surveyor.
