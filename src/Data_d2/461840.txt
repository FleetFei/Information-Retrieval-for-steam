							About This Game
							Zenge is a peculiar puzzle game, telling the story of Eon - a lonely journeyman who's stuck between the worlds and time. Game is intended to be a relaxing experience, thus there are no points, stars, tutorials, move counters, in game shops or any other distractors. Just pure, immersive journey with Eon, told through gorgeous art and music.Made by Michal "Hamster" Pawlowski and Konrad Januszewski (he drew it!).Free Soundtrack : https://soundcloud.com/hamster-on-coke/sets/zenge-soundtrackThanks for supporting us!
