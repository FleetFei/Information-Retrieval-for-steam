							About This Game
							Have you ever dreamt of sailing along your favourite coastline or amongst the tropical islands of the South Pacific?Maybe you prefer the challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms they have to offer?Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access to a boat to do so?With Sailaway you can do all of these things. Sailaway lets you explore the world's oceans in the comfort of your own home, on PC or Mac, in the most accurate simulation of sailing you can find anywhere!In Sailaway, the oceans of the planet have been recreated with unparalleled accuracy; making a trip across the Pacific take months, just as it would on a real boat. With a persistent online world, adjust your settings and your boat will continue to sail even if you aren’t online.  Receive updates via email as your boat continues its progress, but don't forget to check in often – with real-time weather data pulled from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conditions can change in just a few hours.Sailaway gives players the most realistic digital sailing experience to date with in-depth simulations of weather, wind and currents while your boat and it’s sail are modelled to give even the most experienced sailor a work-out. The early difficulty modes will let you sail away while you learn the game and then it truly comes alive when the virtual help is removed and it’s you against the forces of nature. If you’re going to beat your friends then you’ll need to plot your course and constantly monitor your sail’s shape, use any slight advantage to help you arrive first!The ocean can sometimes feel like a lonely place which is why Sailaway includes plenty of ways to enjoy activities with friends and strangers alike. Real-time global, local and group chat will allow you to communicate freely with other sailors to organise your own voyages or even to just pass on sailing tips!Invite others to your boat to help tackle the voyage ahead or if you fancy some friendly competition you can invite them along with their boat to sail alongside each other, we make it easy to share the sailing experience with others.If competitive racing is more your thing then we also have you covered, we have included options to create your own races complete with start/finish lines. Record your finish times in our  online leaderboards and challenge one another for the top spot.Sailaway has been designed to accurately simulate the wonders of sailing as realistically as possible, which means all the little details count!Real Sail TrimEvery control you would expect to find on a real sailboat is here to use in Sailaway, you will be using sheets and trim lines to optimize the shape of your sails and gain every second you can on your journey or race.Real WeatherThe clouds, wind, fog, rain and snow are all simulated according to the real weather as provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This means you can use actual weather predictions from your favorite weather service to plan your journey.Real WavesSailaway simulates the waves accurately, taking the history of wind direction and wind speed into account, as well as current, water depth and nearby islands or shallow areas. The North Sea has different waves than the Atlantic Ocean or South Pacific and each present their own set of challenges.Real Water The colour of the water you sail upon is effected by a great many things, from the blue of pure water to the brownish colour of muddy rivers. Sailaway adjusts water colour by depth and other influences before it renders a single drop of water to make it as realistic as possible.Real Sky Our ancestors navigated by the stars which is why we made sure the positions of the sun, moon, planets and stars are all correct. There is even a handy feature that highlights the constellations but just like in the real world if the sky happens to be cloudy there will be nothing to see but darkness.Real MapsTo aid navigation there is an interactive map that can zoom from world scale to small coves, displaying deep and shallow areas, rocks, buoys, lights and everything you need for a safe journey.
