The judges included Tetsuya Mizuguchi, creator of REZ and LUMINES, and representatives from Ubisoft, Gamespot, and Kongregate.“Classic visual like the Famicon but experiencing the process of sound effects evolving into the music felt really good. The harder the game, the more exciting the music gets — this was blended perfectly.” — Tetsuya MizuguchiKey FeaturesTest your puzzle-solving skills with 63 levelsExperience 7 level themes each with unique music and soundsPlay levels created by the community on the Steam WorkshopCreate your own levels with the included level editor (Windows only)Control the game with a mouse, keyboard, or controller — also works on touchscreensSupports controller vibration for the Xbox 360 controller (Windows only)
