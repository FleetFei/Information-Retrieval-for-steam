							Following in the footsteps of Marco Polo, Colonies and Conquest, the fourth Field of Glory Renaissance Companion, presents the armies and allies of the great civilizations of Asia.

Take on the role of a Portuguese conquistador or Dutch colonist, pushing ever-eastwards, seeking to bring trade and religion to the continent, or command the colorful and unique armies of India, China or Japan, and defend and expand your own empires. With artwork, maps and historical overviews, Colonies and Conquest presents everything you need to wargame the battles and conflicts of Renaissance-era Asia.
