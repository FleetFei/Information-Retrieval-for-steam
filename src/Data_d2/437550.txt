							About This Game
							Melon Simulatorâ„¢ is a chaotic, multiplayer (up to four players), first person melee combat game.  Play as a member of the Melon Inc. Containment Unit, responding to a failed melon simulation.  Work together with your teammates to beat your highscore and compete for your spot on the worldwide leaderboards.  The longer you survive, the harder it gets.  

Almost anything that isn't nailed down can be used to whack, slice, and throw at the oncoming melon hoard... katanas, machetes, paintings, melon chunks, wooden baseball bats, metal baseball bats, spiked baseball bats, planks, spiked planks, sign letters, speakers, and more.
