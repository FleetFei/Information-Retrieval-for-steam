							About This Game
							First contact didn't go as planned, when aliens woke Murray Mendelson up from his afternoon nap. Pulling the trigger first has drawn Murray in to full scale war with these alien visitors, and they’ll stop at nothing to destroy him. Armed with his musket and inconsolable rage, Murray must defend his home against all odds. Why are the aliens only attacking this one house? Who knows?! Shoot first and ask questions later in this endless fast paced arcade shooter, and keep those pesky aliens off of Murray's perfectly manicured lawn!

Collect valuable alien orbs to upgrade your weaponry. Use ‘Cane Time’, ‘Infuriate’, and ‘Soundwave’ power-ups to gain the upper hand when all seems lost. The longer Murray holds the lawn, the stronger those aliens get. But there is plenty of firepower waiting for you to try out in The Shed.

So, lock and load…and Get Off My Lawn!
