							Dark times have come to the land. 
The Knighthood of ShiverBlade has fallen. 
In the depths of the crypts of Anak Shaba lay the bones of Masharan a lich of unbelievable power. 
That power now grows and the forces it draws together prepare for a battle that could end humanity's existence. 
Only one Lord Master of The Blade remains to take vengeance. 

It is time... for action... 

The Crypts of Anak Shaba is a VR based swords and sorcery style adventure. Full arm representations for VR are in, some limiters need to be added on rotations. Motion is currently touch pad controlled but teleportation is also being added if touch pad is uncomfortable.While defeating dozens of foes you must discover the four relics to force Masharan back into this dimension for a final confrontation. Single and dual wield weapons with hip and back sheaths.
