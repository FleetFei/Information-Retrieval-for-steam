							About This Game
							For many years naturalists have been portraying the natural world, and now we can create a self-contained biological world.The organisms(style and movement) are generated by particular mathematical(trigonometric functions) codes, all based on points.This could be a new form of art (Algorithmic Art, for more my stuff : http://guojun-pan.artistwebsites.com).××××××××××××××××××Living in a drop of water.Flowing on the surface.I am no one.My galaxy in one drop.Life is so simple.But full of mystery.××××××××××××××××××Note: For best experience, play this game in a dark room, alone.I am adding more contents as an idle game with art style, just like some virtual installation artwork.
