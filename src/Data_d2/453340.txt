							A Cat Cafe With a Little SecretYou are Avery Grey, the newest employee at a popular cat cafe called A Cat's Paw. The coffee's good and the staff is friendly (and kinda cute!) but mysterious. One day, you find a strange book in the basement, with letters you can't quite read...Meet Your New Best FriendsYou'll work hard at A Cat's Paw, but there's still time to get to know your new coworkers! Who's your favorite? The brusque, but devoted cook Mason? Or maybe Reese, the fashion-obsessed waiter who knows more than he says? And there's always your strange-eyed boss, the enigmatic Graves.Brought to You ByKasey Van Hise: Creator/WriterLindsay Woods: Creator/Art DirectorSamm Neiland: MusicAudra Furuichi: ArtistJenn Doyle: ArtistConrad Kreyling: Technical LeadJo Fu: Product Manager
