							The F11F Tiger was first conceived in 1952 as the result of a design effort to create a low-drag, supersonic aircraft based on the Area Rule, which resulted in the Tiger's distinctive, wasp-waisted fuselage and thin wings.The project was designated G-98 and ultimately resulted in the F11F-1 Tiger, a transitional aircraft with impeccable handling and good looks.  However, good looks were not enough and the Tiger was supplanted by the F8U Crusader, but not before the plane came to the attention of the Blue Angels demonstration team.The Tiger was so reliable, photogenic and aerobatically capable that it served with the Blue Angels for a decade, long after the aircraft was retired from active duty with the Navy. The F11F-1 is a sleek, elegant, and truly beautiful example of Cold War transonic jet technology.  Its excellent overall quality and stage presence has earned it an enduring place in aviation history.This Tiger is a pleasure to fly in FSX: Steam Edition. Immerse yourself in the aircraftâ€™s proud history by flying in formation with your friends in multiplayer. Alternatively, test the boundaries of this Cold War era aircraft by manoeuvring though the air at supersonic speeds.Features	Standard and long-range versions included	Simulated F11F sound set 	Virtual cockpit with animations and clickable controls	2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot and radios, all fully clickable	Automatic (on throttle) animated afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boost	Automatic smoke trail, wing surface vapour flash and wingtip vortices effects	Animated wing-fold, tail hook, speed brakes and pilot figure	Animated canopy (shift-e)	Authentic flight model with illustrated checklist	Animated crew figure
