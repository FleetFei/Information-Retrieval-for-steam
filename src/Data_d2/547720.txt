							One on One Adventures #13The Pearls of PohjolaWelcome to 1 on 1 Adventures, action-packed scenarios designed for 1 player and 1 GM, now powered by Pathfinder Roleplaying Game!1 on 1 Adventures #13: The Pearls of Pohjola is designed for a Sorcerer level 10-12, but with some minor scaling, The Pearls of Pohjola is suitable for use with a traditional four-player party.Long ago when titans walked the earth and great beasts ruled the wild places, there was Pohjola, a land ruled by a great chief of the same name. To him was born 3 daughters, and to each of his daughters he entrusted something sacred, so that they may protect Pohjola in their own fashion according to their own temperament. But a twist of fate and the great avarice and trickery of the bog hag, follower of Louhi, trapped the sisters three in a pendant of pearls. There they wait, frozen in ever-summer with the blush of youth destined to repeat the tale of the old songs until a champion navigates the pearls and frees them. Do you have what it takes to finish the old song once and for all?If you enjoy this adventure, look for future releases in the 1 on 1 Adventure line from Expeditious Retreat Press.Author: Suzi YeeFantasy Grounds Conversion: Cari HarperRequirements: An active subscription or a Full or Ultimate license of Fantasy Grounds and the Pathfinder (3.5E Compatible) ruleset.
