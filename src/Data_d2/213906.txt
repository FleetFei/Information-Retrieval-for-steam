							The fully unlocked “Sliver Hive” deck. Know what it feels like to be a part of the hive mind! You have stayed dormant on the plane of Shandalar long enough. Now it is time to unleash your swarm of predators, seekers, and strikers on all who oppose you. Being the Hivemaster, you will feel the synergy that slivers are known for. Get out as many types of slivers as you can and enjoy the beatdown as you overwhelm your enemy with a force that increasingly grows in power. With every sliver having a list of deadly abilities, your opponents won’t know what hit them until it’s too late. Additional content for Magic 2014.
