							About This Game
							Kingpin is a tale of revenge. Take control of a street gang and order your recruits to attack, defend or even do a little safe-cracking to pick up some needed cash. Use that cash to buy nastier weapons and take down your punk enemies in this intense first-person shooter. Being the Kingpin is half attitude and all action.					Start your own gang and recruit right from the streets. If a new gang member turns out to be a punk, blast him and make room for new ones. Move up in the world, but watch out for the Kingpin; eventually you're going to have to take him on. 					Somewhere in a past that never crossed paths with the future lies the world of the Kingpin. Burned out buildings and urban decay are the landscape. Local gangs roam the streets, protecting their turf and scoping out opportunities. 					Some of the features include					16-player multiplayer action via LAN or Internet					Location-specific damage â€” shoot a snitch in the kneecaps or snuff out a rival with a head-shot
