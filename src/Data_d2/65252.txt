							The Class 70 is one of the most distinctive UK diesel locomotive designs of all time, thanks to its US origins and safety features, and now this superbly-detailed loco comes to Train Simulator in correct Freightliner livery!Developed jointly by Freightliner Ltd and General Electric, the Class 70 was built specifically as a heavy freight locomotive for Freightliner operations in the UK. Built by General Electric in Erie, Pennsylvania, it has a 3,690-horsepower diesel engine, though is still able to meet European Union regulations for diesel engine emissions. However, the Class 70’s most distinctive feature must be its exterior cab design which is immediately recognizable. This is a result of built-in crash protection to protect train crews in the event of a collision, and in fact the entire cab was designed with considerable input from freight train drivers.With a highly realistic driver’s cab including working instrument and information displays, and sounds recorded from the real thing, the Class 70 is as up-to-date as they come and a great addition to your fleet.Class 70 diesel locomotive in Freightliner Powerhaul livery with accurate sounds recorded from a real Class 70.
