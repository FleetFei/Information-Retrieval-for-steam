							While your minions slumber and drool, stuffed from their Christmas gorges, you are wide awake, daydreaming of the ultimate gift: the Empire wrapped in the skin of your foes, and tied off with a bow of their fairest, flowing locks! Since youâ€™ve been such a good Underlord this year, I have a gift for you: his name is Santa Worker, and he has no interest in taking a nap! This time of year he has work to do - digging through the permafrost towards your ultimate victory! Unwrap your Santa Worker and unleash him in Skirmish, Sandbox, Scenario, and Multiplayer modes! Merry Christmas, Underlord!
