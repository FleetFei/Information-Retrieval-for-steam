Industrial Rock!In LogDriveRunner you can run as fast as the wind or lightning in the timber flume - in lifelike and organic, but also surreal surroundings - legally! The game starts with quietly hypnotic guitar music and is becoming more hectic, the more meters you put behind you. If you crash, you need to restart, - here there are no floating coins that allow you to start from where you crashed - no possibility to buy further progress, you need skills!
