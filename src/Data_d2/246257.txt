							PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX main menu "ENTRANCE" is back in an extended version that can now be selected to play with. While the original version was more laid-back, in the long version, the tempo has been increased to match the game's frenetic pace. The track's simple phrase unexpectedly expands in a grandiose fashion at the end.
Add-on included in the All You Can Eat Add-on Pack and Edition.
