							The Class 67 is a very distinctive UK freight locomotive which can also turn its hand to passenger work, and now you can take control of this powerhouse in Train Simulator. The Class 67 diesel electric locomotive, nicknamed the ‘skip’ by railfans, was originally designed as a replacement for the Class 47 to haul high-speed mail and passenger trains. Built in Spain between 1999 and 2000 by Alstom with a General Motors engine and transmission, initial tests proved the Class 67 to be capable of over 140mph. However, the locomotive’s heavy axle load led to a 110mph speed restriction on the class until modifications to the bogies allowed a safe operating speed of 125mph. The locomotives are still restricted to lower speeds on certain routes and particularly at under-bridges because of their axle weight. The engines and running gear are the same as in the Class 66, but with higher gearing to allow faster running. These 90-ton locomotives can be found pulling freight trains, running Thunderbird passenger train rescue duties, hauling the Caledonian Sleeper and even pulling the Royal Train. The Class 67 for Train Simulator features a highly-detailed cab with accurate controls including digital speedometer, and rolling stock.Includes:Class 67 diesel-electric locomotive in EWS maroon, EWS Executive silver, royal claret and DB Schenker liveries Rolling stock: Mk1 Gangway Full Brake NEX mail van and Mk3 SLEP sleeper coach5 scenarios for the  Great Western Main Line  (Oxford-Paddington)
