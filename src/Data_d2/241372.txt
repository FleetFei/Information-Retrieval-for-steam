							Taking inspiration from the conquest and discovery of the New World, this Music Pack adds new music to enhance the Europa Universalis IV soundtrack.

The new tracks, totalling about 10 minutes of new, masterfully composed music are created by the talented Andreas Waldetoft, famous for the music of previous Paradox games such as Crusader Kings II, Hearts of Iron III and Victoria II.
