							As punishment for their petty crimes, eight teen aged lawbreakers are forced to clean up the long-abandoned Blackwell Hotel. Unfortunately for them, the rotting, rat-infested building is home to Jacob Goodnight (WWE star Kane), an ultra-violent psychopath with a fierce score to settle. After one of the group goes missing, the remaining teens are forced to battle this terrifying force of nature who locks them in and begins hunting them down—one by one—in this blood-chilling thriller.
