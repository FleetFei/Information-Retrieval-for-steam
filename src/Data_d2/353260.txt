There are 4 different game modes: The Escort, in which the player needs to take the snails to the exit. The Exterminator, in which the player has to kill all the snails. The Snail King, in which thereâ€™s a special snail, The King, that the player has to take to the exit and must be kept alive. Finally, Time Attack, in which the player has to take the snails to the exit within the time limit.
