							First flown in 1979, the Long E-Z is an amateur-built aircraft derived from Rutanâ€™s earlier VariEze model. It is a canard pusher design optimised for long-range, fuel efficient flight and has the option of an additional internal fuel tank to push maximum range to more than 4,500 miles. Typically fitted with engines of around 100 horsepower, the Long E-Z cruises at 125 knots and can be configured to carry one passenger in addition to the pilot.  The FSX: Steam Edition version of this quirky aircraft from Virtavia features six variations with 10 liveries, a fully clickable cockpit, and even separate sets of flight dynamics for both engine types (AvCo Lycoming O-235 and O-320). High quality audio is also included as well as a variety of custom animations.Features 	6 model variations with 10 detailed texture sets	Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and clickable controls	All Virtual Cockpit gauges are 3D models complete with 3D working parts such as needles, flags etc.	All gauges are fully clickable	Gauges feature custom night time illumination	Larger gauges have togglable 'floater' digital displays for added usability	Authentic flight dynamics, fully tested and approved by real E-Z pilots	High quality audio 	Realistic pilot model with auto-animations and user-input animations combined	Animations which include : ventral spoiler, nose gear retract, nose gear 'kneel', canopy, rudders, canards
