							Fate of the World: Migration DLC adds a whole new dimension to the global political strategy game. With environmental collapse around the world, millions of Climate Refugees feel their homelands in search of a safer home.
						New Mission: The Flood is an all-new, self-contained mission that focuses on the human impact of climate change in the next century. In The Flood, you take up the reins of the Global Environmental Organization 80 years after its inception...and your predecessor left a mess. The seas may be rising, and the deserts spreading but the biggest crisis facing Earth is the urgent threat of millions of people forced to flee their homes and countries. Where will these climate refugees go? Relax and tighten borders, curb or encourage emigration and integrate new settlers quickly, or you'll have no choice but to take drastic measures.  Whatever you choose, step carefully, or the cost in human life will be unheard of.
