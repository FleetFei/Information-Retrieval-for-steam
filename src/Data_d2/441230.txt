							What Is Babel: tower to the Gods?It's a charming physics based puzzle game designed around room-scale VR for the HTC Vive, which will test your coordination and wits, as you battle physics while working out how to de-construct part of a tower (to the gods).You'll have to approach the towers from every angle walk, crouch, and even possibly jump, using a range of divine tools & weaponry to carefully disassemble & thoroughly check the stability of each unique and bizarre monument built before you, all while protecting the sacred totem, to ensure it's safety for it's worshippers!There's a variety of different types of puzzles in it, requiring a range of different skills - precision, logic, speed & more!Examples:Precision - Using careful movements of your Vive controllers, slide a sword between blocks and push out blocks whilst narrowly avoiding the volatile and explosive bomb blocks, which will detonate with the slightest of your touch!Logic - Work out the correct order & method of deconstruction! Knock out blocks simultaneously to keep the tower balance! Or, is there a large amount of blocks ontop of a slippery ice block? Give it a fast & hard whack from the side to sent it quickly sliding out of the tower without the blocks ontop falling off!Speed - Some towers may contain blocks that are being burnt away! Once these blocks finish burning, they'll be reduced to ash & disappear! Solve the tower fast enough that these burning blocks don't cause it to topple!We'll be adding more block types, features & even new game-modes in the future! So an eye on those change logs to see what's new!
