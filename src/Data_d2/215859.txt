							The fully unlocked “Sword of the Samurai” deck. Honor is not something you are born with. It is something you earn through your deeds and actions. Take up your sword and defend the sacred code of Bushido from any who would dare to bring dishonor to your clan. Your ronin and samurai stand ready to follow your commands to the letter, taking control of the ground while you summon the great dragons of Kamigawa to fly overhead, all the while hurling spells of wrath and fury. Know the true glory of combat as you walk the way of the samurai! Additional content for Magic 2014.  Requires Magic 2014 Expansion.
