							All content included is royalty-freeThe first official release of the Loop Loft "Artist Series", The Bob Reynolds Collection is the ultimate set of saxophone tracks.  Recorded over the course of several days in a Los Angeles studio, we worked directly with Reynolds to produce 13 complete sessions of high quality sax recordings that are specifically tailored for looping.  Whether you're a singer-songwriter looking to add some horn lines, a jazz musician seeking some inspiration for your compositions and improvisation, or an electronic artist looking for the perfect "hook" to your track, now is your chance to incorporate the highly melodic and soulful playing of Bob Reynolds directly into your own music.
