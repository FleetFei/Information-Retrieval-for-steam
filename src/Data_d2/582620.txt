							Copoka is an open-world exploratory indie game about a bird building its nest in a totalitarian city state. As a player, you are soaring free, high above the city of Copoka, as a contrast to the citizens below. Your goal is to find and collect twigs for your nest, and as you construct your home piece by piece a story of intrigue and politics beneath around you.Key FeaturesTake wing and enjoy the freedom of flightExperience a city boiling with strife and political turmoilEavesdrop on conversations to get the full story of the cityStoryThe city of Copoka is in distress. Speakers all around the city proclaim the glory of the Great Leader and how she will bring salvation to a country in need, while people lament in the streets about starvation and dissatisfaction. Something is brewing in the back alleys of the slums. Whispers in the wind tell about a coming uprising, about an end to the suffering and new hope for the citizens of Copoka. Being a bird you can undertake the role of silent observer. By listening to people around the city a more nuanced picture of the brewing conflict is revealed - a conflict concerning clashing ideologies regardless of social standing or allegiance. Of course, itâ€™s up to you if you wish to stop and listen. After all, what are human concerns to a bird anyway?
