							Distance is survival racing. Fusing arcade racing action with exploration, your car must survive by boosting, jumping, rotating, and flying through a deadly and mysterious city.The roads are treacherous with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, survive to the end in the quickest time. Your car has abilities that not only allow you to drive on the track, but upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. Take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends!
