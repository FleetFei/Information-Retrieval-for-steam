As an agent of Odin, you will explore cavernous dungeons hunting for treasure, race for your life from surprise traps, and have vicious axe battles with blood-thirsty kobolds. Loki has left some tricky obstacles in your path, but you will find powerful equipment, trusty friends, and many secrets to help along the way.
