							The LNER Peppercorn K1 locomotives were built between 1949 and 1950, with the intention of splitting them between the North Eastern and Eastern Regions. Many K1s would regularly be seen as far north as Edinburgh and they were frequently used on the West Highland line in the early days. Many were later allocated to the Eastern Region with a large number going to March, Cambridgeshire. K1's were used throughout the former LNER network and proved to be very versatile, working everything from local coal trains to express passenger services.The K1’s were withdrawn and scrapped by 1967: however, No. 62005 was used for a short time as an emergency boiler and consequently survived into preservation. It has become very popular on main line rail tours especially on the West Highland Line to Mallaig and has also sported the un-prototypical, but very fetching, LNER Green Lined livery as No. 2005.ScenariosEight scenarios for the  Weardale & Teesdale Network Route  Back In Service Coal to Penrith March Surprise Passenger Duties Pea Souper West Durham Rail Tour Bricks Without Straw April ShowersMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
