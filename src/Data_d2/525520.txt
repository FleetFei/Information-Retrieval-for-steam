							Those who forged the Crown have returned!

Great treasure and great peril arise from the burning depths. The Ifrit have risen from their underground kingdom to consume all the land in flaming death. They will not stop until every field is burned to ash and every surface dweller is clapped in chains of brass and taken down to the flaming caverns below.

The Firelands expansion offers Talisman: Digital Edition players 81 new Adventure Cards, 19 new Spell Cards, 19 Terrain Cards, 3 Alternative Ending Cards, 4 new characters, and firelands tokens representing the expanding conquest of the Ifrit across the land.

Will you be able to extinguish the flame?
