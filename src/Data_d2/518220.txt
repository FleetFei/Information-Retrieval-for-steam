							About This Video
							Two best friends who dress up as super heroes, protecting the city from a greedy half-pirate, half-corporate villain and a mad scientist bent on world domination. What could go wrong? X-Ray and Vav want to be the greatest super heroes ever, but they're the last people you'd want to be saved by. Despite their lack of superhero prowess, the duo is ready to take on any thug, robber or villain who stands in the way of justice. And they'll do it in true X-Ray and Vav fashion; crotch touching and creating chaos to save the day (for the most part)!
