							The heavyweight of UK freight is coming! The updated General Motors built Freightliner Class 66 V2.0 ‘Shed’ is now available for Train Simulator, with scenarios for the Edinburgh-Glasgow route.The Class 66 was introduced to the UK in 1998 as a replacement to the popular Class 59, using the same body shell as its forerunner but with updated power units, internal fittings, new computer control systems, radial steering bogies and 3,000hp engines. In total, 446 of the Class were built, quickly making the Class 66 the diesel freight locomotive of choice among UK freight operators, including Freightliner, GB Railfreight, Direct Rail Services and EWS, mainly for freight operations but also with some charter passenger services on their roster. Their popularity has also seen variations of the Class 66 enter service for European operators as a result of their versatility.The Freightliner Class 66 V2.0 for Train Simulator is a re-worked model of a previous version, with an updated and improved interior and re-modelled exterior.
