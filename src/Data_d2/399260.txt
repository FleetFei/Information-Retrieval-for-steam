							About This Game
							Alice's Mom's Rescue is an indie puzzle / platformer game in the pure style of old school pixel art.
The Giant Raven Has Captured Alice's mother.
Help Alice save her mother through the 3 worlds and 25 levels!
Change Alice's height by jumping on the magic mushrooms to get through the tiny spaces.
But be aware that a small size will also affect Alice's physical abilities!
Solve puzzles, beware of the evil cats, birds, bats & spikes, and find the right path to victory.
