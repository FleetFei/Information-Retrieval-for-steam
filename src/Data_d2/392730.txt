							About This Game
							A point and click puzzle adventure about the mad wizard Keith, and his quest to find friends. Keith is a very lonely man, and no one comes to his parties - so he decides to rob an entire graveyard to create zombie cyborg friends to come to his parties. Join him in robbing graves, cutting up corpses, creating steam-punk cyborgs and hosting parties - and then dealing with the consequences when he upsets everyone.

You will use his skills as an accomplished wizard, scientist and engineer to solve his problems - from making a heart beat, creating a death machine or just mixing a delicious drink, combining multiple items at the same kind to make all sorts of bizarre creations.

Explore his life through 10 levels, get him out from the depths of depression, help him find friends, make friends, lose friends, and make more - some in more traditional manners than others.
