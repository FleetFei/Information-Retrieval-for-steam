							About This Game
							Take a deep-dive tour through your Solar System, and then venture beyond if you dare!Gain new perspective on what our universe actually looks like by taking advantage of the increased spatial awareness made possible by modern VR.  Be entertained by dynamic music, and exciting authentic visuals that we are otherwise unlikely to experience in our lifetimes.Each planet and moon in this experience are built using real data from space agencies around the world.  See for yourself what makes each one unique.  Sizes and distances are intentionally unrealistic - all planetary bodies are toy-sized, shrunk to a millionth of their actual size, so in VR Earth appears to be the size of a small house.Stay as long as you like at each tour stop - there's lots to do at each one, with more being added in the future.  Absorb up-to-date facts and experience our Solar System in brand new ways with several unique modes.This app is in active development with a clear roadmap of new content and features. Here is what you get right now: The "Classic" tour, updated with full support for the premium VR headsets HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Standing support. Comfort mode. Side-by-Side Comparisons. Gravity Probe Launcher. Real Distance Viewer. Hand controller support. Small content additions.The roadmap includes FIVE more major features and modes, plus additional content for the Solar System, and fresh new content beyond.   New features and content will be released in regular chunks, always polished and playable, and always built from the ground up for VR.
