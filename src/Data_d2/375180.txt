							About This Game
							The Lunchinator is Here!

Welcome to Lunch Island! Where the sun always shines, everything comes in perfect individual servings and the only meal served is, LUNCH!

Head to the beach and finish the Ice Cream Sandwich event or head to the City and supply Comic Con with pretzels and coffee? 

Compete in Competitions! Who has the best Hot Dog on Lunch Island? Who has the best Hot Chocolate?

Compete against other NPC’s in Cook-offs! 

The Monday commute is a drag, the city must be packed. On Lunch Island, lunchers have schedules and certain locations will see more action depending on the day of the week. 

It’s the weekend and lunchers like to get away to the Beach or to the Ski Resort in the mountains! 

Just got a message on your cell phone that the locals in the Burbs are trying to oust the Mayor. Head there and take advantage of the influx in lunchers.
