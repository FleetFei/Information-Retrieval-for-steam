							Eagerly anticipated, long awaited and now finally here: our smart, new Hccrrs car transporter! Enhance your vehicle fleet with this unique gem and set off on a great journey with the car-driving nation of Germany!

The state-of-the-art Hccrrs car transporter also guarantees complete protection for the highest quality cars and impresses with its realistic textures and accurate labelling, which as usual has been provided with attention to every detail. Of course, variety is also a key factor: The random choice between three different degrees of soiling ensures that your train is never drab.

We are also very happy to have granted your wish for graffiti on the train. You have the option of the car running with colourful labelling or without any at all. This process also enables you to choose the graffiti yourself. Of course, other details have not been neglected either, such as winter textures, animated brakes and an attractive sound.

Two sessions for the free Niddertalbahn Route are already included.
