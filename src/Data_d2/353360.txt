							About This Game
							"how do you Do It?" is a game by Nina Freeman, Emmett Butler, Decky Coss, and Joni Kittaka. The game puts players in the role of an 11-year-old girl whose mother has just stepped out for an errand. The girl immediately grabs her dolls and furtively attempts to figure out how sex works using these plastic surrogates.

"how do you Do It?" has been nominated and shown at festivals including Indiecade and the Independent Games Festival.

It was made in 3 days at Global Game Jam in New York City during 2014.
