							A mysterious green light awakens you one night. Before you have a chance to move, it expands and grows brighter until it blinds you.

A vision appears among the light. A malicious lich has risen and is building an army of ghouls to take over the world.

You land upon a hard surface. When you can finally see again, you discover that you've been transported back into the toxic tunnels.

The lich must be stopped before it's too late for humanity!

This DLC contains 10 new levels, new puzzle elements, new monsters, and new music.
