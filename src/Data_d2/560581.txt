							In Siralim 2, you can use "Skin" items to change the way your creatures look. These changes are only cosmetic, and do not otherwise affect gameplay. This DLC grants you an infinite number of every skin in the game. You can view all the skins by visiting the Transmogrification Pedestal in your kingdom's main room.

Each time you restart the game, this DLC will ensure that you have at least 1 of each type of skin in your inventory. You can restart the game to replenish your inventory of skins after you use them.
