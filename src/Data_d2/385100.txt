							About This Game
							Space - The Return Of The Pixxelfrazzer is an open-world sci-fi hack'n'slash.

Your aim is to explore the inexhaustible amounts of destructible asteroid fields, spacestations and unknown planets of the universe.
And by exploring I mean hacking, slashing and destroying everything that comes into your way.
Shredding all kind of objects means getting more resources and getting more resources means upgrading your ship so you can shred more kind of objects, which rapidly becomes an addicting spiral.
And maybe, one day you'll probably find out about one of the most unsolved mystery of our universe... the pixxelfrazzer.
