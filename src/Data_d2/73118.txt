							After some tiring, yet enjoyable, days of commandeering an unwilling workforce, Jólnir - the Crimson King - decided to take the day off. 

While lounging in his recliner by the fireplace, he fell into the world of dreams. After a rather unpleasant awakening he found himself in a very dangerous place - at the blunt end of a very large club.

Thrown out of his workshop by the very goblins whose blood usually stains his clothes crimson, and his staff nowhere to be seen, he must rely on the wizards to help him reclaim his workshop and his honor.
