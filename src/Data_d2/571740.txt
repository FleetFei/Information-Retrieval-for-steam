							About This Game
							Golf It! is a multiplayer Minigolf game with focus on a dynamic, fun and creative multiplayer experience. One of the most exciting features is a Multiplayer Editor, where you can build and play custom maps together with your friends.This version of the game features at least 4 different maps with 18 holes each: Grassland, Winterland, Graveyard and Mines. A 5th map called Pirates Cove can already be played, but it is still under construction. Every map has unique gameplay features and different aesthetics. Every asset of each area and more will be available for you inside the Multiplayer Editor and you are free to mix them all together to create the map of your desires! Currently there are over 1.000 placeable objects inside the Multiplayer Editor!To have a more fun and different experience each time you play, we are using a ball hitting system which is based on the speed of the mouse. The faster you swing your mouse the harder you will hit the ball. It takes more experience and practice to hit that precious hole in one every time.
