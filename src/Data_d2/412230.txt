							InfiniTrap is a fast paced puzzle game for hardcore players. The game contains 40 levels and is available on Windows, OSX and Linux. Every level starts with the player character standing on the start tile. The start tile is perfectly safe-- No, trust me. It's safe. Once you leave the start tile, you have a limited time to reach the treasure before the level crushes you.
