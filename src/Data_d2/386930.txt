							About This Game
							Engage in pitched combat piloting a spectacular dragon through worlds of medieval fantasy.  Dragonflight features massive, destructible environments, fast-paced combat with up to twenty enemies swarming the skies around you, ancient castles teeming with archers, and lost wizard towers shrouded in mist. Dragonflight also features a VR mode - ride your dragon through showers of flaming arrows, or dodge trees as you fly low over a fantasy landscape, hiding from enemies arrayed against you.  Dragonflight includes unique combinations of game dynamics - acrobatic flight compliments stealthly subterfuge, as you dodge from cloud to cloud, sneaking up on fortifications too large to approach out in the open.

VR Support is now offered for Vive & Oculus, through our "pre-alpha" build (look in the beta tab, under properties).  We're experimenting with different VR modes now - some are best with hand-held controllers, some are best with a joystick/game-pad.  VR modes require you to install SteamVR.
