							About This Game
							Vectonic is a fast paced local-multiplayer action game.

Take control of a verticraft and stomp on the enemy crafts on your way to VECTORY.

Play in an ever vibrant landscape where every map is procedurally generated to always keep you on your toes.

Described most simply as "a neon demo-derby", Vectonic makes for great fun with friends.
