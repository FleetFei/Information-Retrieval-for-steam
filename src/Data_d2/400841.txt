A: The skin for the heroes will wait in your account in-game. When each hero is on free rotation or you choose to buy them, it will become available immediately. The skins are yours and you own them, no matter what.  Q: What happens if I bought one of these skins from the game store already? A: You buy this pack and get the six. If you've bought one already, that's AWESOME but alas it won't be replaced for anything else.

Get the skins or go about your business, reader.
