							Always wanted to see if you can hack the day-to-day life of a TV producer? Here's your chance! 						MUD TV is your ticket to the weird wild world of television. Once you take control of your own station it's up to you to determine the line-up, hire actors and directors, produce your own shows, series and movies and to grab those lucrative advertising deals from right under your competitors' noses. Oh, and about the competition: you can either play MUD TV alone, with your friends over a network or via Internet! Go head-to-head with your opponents as you fight for market share amongst the retired and housewives, headhunt their best employees and, if that doesn't do the trick, a little sabotage should keep your enemies from getting too bored! Or, as an alternative, you can assume control of a station together with a friend and run it cooperatively.						Create your own crazy station and take it to the top of the ratings						Create your own television empire and build offices, studios, newsrooms and many other important facilities to help secure your success						Create your own character and guide them through your own hard-earned television empire						Produce your own movies or secure the rights to the best of what the free market has to offer before the competition does
