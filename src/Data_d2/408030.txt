							About This Game
							One of the longest running independent games on the Internet, UniBall has evolved from a simple version of space hockey into an online multiplayer e-sport that is uniquely its own. 

The basics remain simple and easy to learn: you maneuver, you pass and you shoot in order to score goals. 

But beyond this simple design lies a surprisingly complex game involving teamwork and individual skill that can take a lifetime to master.
