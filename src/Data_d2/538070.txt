							About This Game
							Welcome in Bad Dream: Coma. A point&click  game where unique minimalistic art style creates an unforgettable and atmospheric experience. Travel through the surreal and disturbing dreamland where everything depends on your actions. You can't die but you can suffer greatly...

TIP OF THE ICEBERG
The game is designed in the "action-reaction" way and there are no obvious choices. Beat the game once and then be curious "What if I would do it differently". Sometimes it's something small but from time to time you'll see huge differences. The smallest things can be most rewarding.
