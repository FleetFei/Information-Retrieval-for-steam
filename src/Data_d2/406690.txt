							About This Game
							Roses and Gems is a game all about avoiding the inevitable, Death. Build up your fort, castle, or small shack and wait for night time where horrid 'harmless' critters come,destroy your home, and kill you. Then start all over again! As you get better at making traps and fighting, you'll survive longer. Will you dig underground for better materials, or just stick with wood and stone constructs? Will you prioritise trading, or having a flawless defense system? In the end you'll die either way, your home destroyed and demolished, but what you do until then is up to you!

Fighting not your thing? Build traps! Traps not your thing? Slash and bash your way through enemies and show those silly intellectual trap builders what true power is! In the end, you have two goals, protect yourself and the machine. Legend says if the machine is destroyed, the world will explode! Kinda sucks that legends are always true, doesn't it?
