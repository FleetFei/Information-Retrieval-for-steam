-- Choose your opponents --
★ Everyday at midnight (GMT) the daily track is switched.
★ You initially compete against random 'ghost-lap' recordings of other players using the same type of car. We call this Division: Unclassified.
★ When enough laps have been recorded for a car type, they are sorted into six ranked divisions. You start by racing against opponents from division F, and when you beat all 4 ghosts in your session you will be allowed to progress to division E, and so on.
★ At any time you may also choose to race against the ghost-laps of your own friends.

-- Scoring --
Medals are awarded at the end of each day, based on the best laptimes. Each medal earns an in-game coin which you can use to unlock and upgrade cars.
★ 60 points for the best overall laptime
★ 20 points for the best laptime in each type of car
★ 5 points for a Gold Tier laptime, i.e. one that is within 105% of the winner for each type of car
★ 2 points for a Silver Tier laptime, i.e. one that is within 110% of the winner for each type of car

Every month, the final medals leaderboard is posted to our Facebook page, along with some custom analysis from our expert racing team. Then a new championship starts!
