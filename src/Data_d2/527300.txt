							About This Game
							DOPAMINE is a competitive high-speed action shooter in VR. 
Fly and boost-dash through space, fire your beams and homing lasers, and go head-to-head against your opponents!

Two game modes are available: Single Play for just you, and an Online Play mode to compete against other players.

Set your username and character from the settings, and learn the basics by playing the tutorial mode. You can use Key Config to rearrange the button mappings as you like.

Practice makes perfect. Improve your skills to reach for the top spot in the rankings!
