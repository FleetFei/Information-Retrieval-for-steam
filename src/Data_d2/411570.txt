							Could you survive a zombie apocalypse?

"Zombie Exodus" is a thrilling 750,000-word interactive survival-horror novel by Jim Dattilo, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--without animation or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

It starts with a daring escape from your zombie-infested city, and it ends at Zombie Exodus, when a horde of zombies swarms outlying settlements like locusts.

Will you be a soldier, athlete, carpenter, minister, or scientist? Play as male or female, gay or straight, and even find romance in the post-apocalypse.

Are you ready for Zombie Exodus?
