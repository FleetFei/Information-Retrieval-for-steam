							Along with railways, the growth of the canal network was a visible sign of the industrial revolution across the UK. Using either horsepower or steam power, canal barges plied between the major manufacturing centres of Britain with deliveries of fuel and products, using a network of level canal ways with systems of locks to allow gradients to be negotiated. Many of those old canals can still be seen today, and a number of the former canal barges have been converted into brightly-painted narrow boats for holiday use and even as accommodation. 
The Canal Pack for Train Simulator includes a number of assets to enable you to create realistic canal scenes within Train Simulator routes. Included are a canal lock, typical canal stone bridge, canal tunnel entrance, canal-side buildings, picnic tables, four designs of narrow boat, and canal lofts with and without animated canal boat traffic.
