							NOTE: THE MAIN GAME X-PLANE 10 IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE! PLEASE ONLY PURCHASE DLCS WHEN YOU ARE OWNER OF X-PLANE 10!The Airport Zurich (previously Zurich-Kloten) is the largest airport of Switzerland, now in a brand new version for X-Plane 10. This completely new scenery is full of details, including every building and the entire airport environment, De-Icing and all features you would expect from a modern scenery for X-Plane.The ground layout has been created from scratch based on high resolution aerial images and it complies with the current data of the charts. The development of the airport facilities meets the state of late 2015 as well.The buildings and objects in this scenery were modeled with numerous 3D details and photo realistic textures; in some parts, even high resolution 2K textures were used. A multitude of animations for the radar systems, windsocks, airport traffic and more move this airport even closer to its real counterpart. The faithful signage and lighting of all taxiways and runways round off this impression. And thanks to baked textures in combination with X-Plane’s HDR rendering, Airport Zurich will shine at night as well with excellent effects.Despite all the features and complexity, great attention has been paid to the performance of this airport so it can be shown with a good frame rate.The finished development condition results in some new features:Newly created buildings and objects with lots of 3D details, partly high resolution 2K texturesNew transparent boarding bridges with glass sides at every gateUpdated taxiways and parking positions, as creating parking positions for the Airbus A380 changed other positions and moved lots of taxiway markingsParking position E67 at Dock E now includes a separate, elevated boarding bridgeStatic Airbus A380 of Emirates Airline, parking at Gate E67Terminal 2 was recently rebuilt and was finished by the end of 2015 – we already completely finished the terminal for this sceneryEnhanced Apron P with additional parking positionsJet engine test site with new, large noise absorption hallThe entrances to terminals 1 and 2 were recently rebuilt – we already completely finished the reconstruction for this scenery, including a new roofingAdditional features:Completely created scenery of Airport Zurich for X-Plane 10, state of late 2015Detailed representation of the airportPhoto realistic ground textures based on aerial images (0,5m/pixel)All buildings and airport facilitiesPhoto real textures for buildings, vehicles etc.Complete taxiway and runway signage“High speed taxiways”, allowing for exiting the runway at high speedsGreat night effects (baked textures + X-Plane 10 HDR)Animated radar systems and wind hosesAnimated vehicle traffic at and around the airportTrue to original runway and taxiway lightingTraffic routes with ground traffic signageOptimised for good performance (frame rate)Custom Mesh for the Airport AreaAnimated De-icing Trucks east of Terminal EVFR HelperGates A44, A47, A48, A49, A55 with animated Jetways (installed AutoGate Version is needed)Manual in English/German and up to date charts
