							About This Game
							As Shu, a space-cactus of the bouncy persuasion, you spring from planet to planet, spreading plant life and finding new friends. Create a forest! Enjoy a splash in a pond! Play tag with a bee! Make weird hybrid plants! Launch a giraffe into orbit!

Shuâ€™s Garden is a fully open playground with no hard goals, scores or missions. Just kick back, explore and experiment in this space-garden full of friends, foliage, and fun.

An all-ages videogame by Colin Sanders and Jason RT Bond.
