Planet Earth, the once beautiful blue globe and thriving civilization, is now nothing more than a wasteland. Unable to sustain any form of life, the population is destitute of a habitation, and struggling to survive. With no where to run, their only option is a distant space colony, Planet TSI-5, where darkness is tangible and the unknown permeates the air. Upon their arrival, the colonists survey this foreign territory and stumble upon mineral in crystal form. After further examination it becomes evident this is no ordinary crystal. Much time is spent studying and experimenting with this mineral, and eventually the composition of the crystals is decoded, revealing the incredible powers imbued within them. The researchers continue to explore  the most effective methods of extracting various energies from these crystals and their many applications. They name it Pure Crystal, a rather simple name for something retaining powers never witnessed before by the human race; the power of opening portals to parallel universes. It becomes obvious that Pure Crystal  is the key to survival, and a resource worthy waging war over. The colonist engineer a clan of powerful robots whose task is to hunt the nearby planets for large deposits of Pure Crystal.  After an exhaustive search, a planet is discovered with an abundance of Pure Crystal deposits. However, the residents of that planet are well prepared to defend against invaders who want to plunder their valuable mineral. You are one of the robots, and are now tasked to secure and deliver this Pure Crystal back to TSI-5. Make a Guild, fight a war, and bring it home. it is the sole purpose of your creation.
