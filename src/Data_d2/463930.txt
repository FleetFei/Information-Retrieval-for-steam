							About This Game
							"The Dweller" is a puzzle game where YOU ARE THE MONSTER.

A team of archaeologists are exploring an ancient underground city. Unfortunately for them, they've awoken a monster... You play as that monster. It's your goal to get rid of all those pesky intruders invading the ruins that you call your home.

You are an ancient and powerful entity, however, your movement is restricted to the cave rock, so use your wits and the various boulders in the caverns to navigate the ruins, and reach and eliminate everyone in each level. Discover new mechanics as you play through the game, such as teleportation.

As you beat levels, you unlock notes that reveal the story of the game. Discover the fate of the archaeologists, learn of a mysterious clandestine organization, and maybe even find out your origins.
