							The Piper PA-34 Seneca was first flown in 1969. Initially designed as a twin engine version of the Cherokee Six, the Seneca is normally used for personal and business transportation, boasting a range of approximately 725 nautical miles.  The 200T variant of the Seneca was introduced in 1974, and included an engine upgrade to turbocharged six cylinder Continental TSIO-360E or EB engines. The ailerons were enlarged, and a rudder anti-servo tab was also added.  The Carenado version of the Piper PA-34-200T Seneca II provides a detailed flight deck with fully functional gauges, making it ideal for advanced simmers as well as fledgling pilots. The sound effects have been sourced from an actual PA-34. Also featured are animated rudder, flap, and aileron movements, removable engine cowls, and fully functional cargo doors.FeaturesIFR certification Original HQ digital stereo sounds (44100 HZ) recorded from the original aircraftAnimated parts include doors, sun visor, vibrating antenna and vibrating static wicks3D modelled pilot and cockpit areaDetails include chocks, cowl plugs and baggage areaRealistic light effects on gaugesNightlight effects on panelBuilt-in zoom gaugesSeparate switches for instruments lights and dome light
