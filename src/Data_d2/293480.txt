							FRONTIERS blends the feel of first-person RPG classics like Daggerfall with the relaxing tempo and simplicity of a point-and-click adventure. Discover ancient mysteries, live off the land and fight deadly creatures, all in a beautiful, massive open world.Is FRONTIERS for you?I can still remember the first time I played Daggerfall. Yes, it was uglier than a monkey's armpit and controlled worse than a bumper car on a frozen lake. But it also created the feeling of a world that lived on even after I'd stopped playing, and that feeling still sticks with me all these years later. A world where you could spend hours searching every pixelated nook and cranny. A world of potential. A world of exploration......and then a Dragonling would chomp my face because I hadn't spent ten hours grinding in the easy regions. Arg! So frustrating! Other games have touched on that elusive feeling, especially Elder Scrolls and early Fallout games, but as fun as they are and as much as I love hardcore RPG mechanics, I've always dreamt of a game that emphasized exploration above all else.If you feel the same way then yes - FRONTIERS is for you!Key Features:Massive open world - go anywhere, any timeUnique relaxing pace and toneAn exploration-focused main quest that spans an entire continentSimple gameplay - no stats or skill trees to memorize (It barely qualifies as an RPG, really)Live off the land - hunt, trap, fish and cook dozens of varieties of plantlife (including hallucinogens!) and a dozen varieties of animalMinecraft-style item crafting systemDozens of skills to discover and learn, including magic, survival and stealth skillsHundreds of shops, taverns, homes, caves, castles and other structures to exploreA haunting soundtrack for every regionFull mod supportNEW: Oculus Rift supportNOTE: I recommend reading reviews & forum posts before purchasing, especially concerning Linux support.
