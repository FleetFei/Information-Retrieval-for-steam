							Nefarox’s fully unlocked “Exalted Darkness” white and black deck. Nefarox is the demon overlord of Grixis, a dark and hellish land overrun with death magic. Nefarox’s might is so great that cultists revere and worship him, and this reverence gives Nefarox real power. Nefarox occasionally grants this power to one of his minions, but he usually prefers to keep it for himself and fight his enemies directly.
