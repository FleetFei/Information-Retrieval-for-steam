							Originally the teenage sidekick of Captain America, Bucky Barnes was thrust into a life of torture and black ops work after being caught in an explosion caused by Baron Zemo. Post-explosion, Bucky was captured by a secret organization in Russia that used cryogenic freezing and advanced mind-wiping techniques to use him as an assassin whenever he was needed for decades. It was not until battling Captain America face to face (and with the assistance of the Cosmic Cube) that Bucky was able to fight his forced programming and reclaim his position as a hero. He now works with S.H.I.E.L.D. alongside Black Widow, and has even acted as Captain America for a time.Items Included in this Pack:Winter SoldierLongest Winter (Default) CostumeWinter Soldier Hero S.T.A.S.H.
