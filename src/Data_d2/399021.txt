							The digital artbook of Without Within 2. I have included my thoughts next to each image. The commentaries are only available in English and I am thankful for your understanding.

This artbook is presented in PDF format and can be opened using Adobe Acrobat Reader, which can be downloaded for free online. Once purchased and installed, the artbook can be found in the game's root directory. To access this folder, right click on Without Within 2 in your Steam library and select properties. Inside the pop up, pick the local files tab and click the browse local files button. You should see the PDF in the folder that appears.
