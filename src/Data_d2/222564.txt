							The Class 101 was one of the largest classes of first generation Diesel Multiple Units on the British railway network, and you can now experience this DMU for Train Simulator, upgraded from a previous Class 101 pack and in the striking Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) livery.Built by Metro-Cammell Works in Birmingham from 1956, the Class 101 was made up from a number of sub-classes, making them the most numerous and possibly most successful and well known of first generation DMUs. Sets were supplied in two, three and four car sets, depending on the service they were intended for, and passenger accommodation was provided in first and standard class configuration.With more than 500 units built, the Class 101 could be seen on routes across the country and saw service many years into the privatisation of Britain’s railways. The final five units survived 47 years of service, finally being withdrawn on 24 December 2003, but thanks to their longevity many units have been preserved on the country’s heritage railways. Re-skinned and upgraded from an earlier Class 101 pack, the Class 101 for Train Simulator is available in Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) black and orange livery, the first such time the distinctive livery has appeared on any Train Simulator model.
