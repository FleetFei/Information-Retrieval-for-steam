							About This Game
							You are Battle Class Bot X-17 and you have crash landed on Planet Downpour. Another surviving builder Class Bot B-16 seems to have built a base and activated you. An empty X-16 case seems to be the reason why. You are the last chance of escape... 

Battle the never ending hordes of enemies set on overwhelming your base. Protect the antenna B-16 is building to contact home planet. The journey is unforgiving, and will require mastery of the hover shield battle system. Will be you able to manage your resources to keep yourself and your base running? Will you stay at base, and endure the slow process of building an antenna or will you risk venturing out to find antenna boxes.
