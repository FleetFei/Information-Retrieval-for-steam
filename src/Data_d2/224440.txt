							About This Game
							Folk Tale is a fantasy village builder ARPG game in which you lead a ragtag band of peasants in growing a thriving market town, while dastardly minions plot your downfall! Recruit heroes and head out into the wilds to fight back against evil. Or, you know, to get sweet sweet loot. Either or.Players are comparing elements of gameplay with Warcraft 3, The Settlers, Banished, The Guild 2, Majesty 2 and Black and White 2. Folk Tale is not a pure play role-playing game such as Pillars Of Eternity, and adopts more of a MOBA approach to hero abilities than a CRPG. Nor is it an RTS game (although some of the controls are similar).FeaturesFor more information please visit the Development Roadmap on our website.
