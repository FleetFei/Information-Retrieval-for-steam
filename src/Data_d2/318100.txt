							About This Game
							AXYOS is an experimental FPS being made for players by players!Inspired by giants of gaming industry, we made a decision to create our own game, which would inherit some key aspects of FPS and MOBA genres but was built relying on opinions of common gamers. This is how AXYOS came to be. Together, we can make this game happen!To say it simple - this game is a combination of a MOBA genre and mostly multiplayer FPS. We are trying to implement MOBA elements such as Ingame shop and session level-up system inside of a shooter mechanics. By the time of full release, we will introduce more and more of such elements and balance these two genres within one game.We are set to leave the Early Access program and get to full release as soon as it is possible!
