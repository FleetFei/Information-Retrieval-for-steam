							About This Game
							There are so many games set in space, willingly limiting their scope to new instances of Star Wars-style ships, blasters and myths. Devouring Stars is an attempt at expanding the horizon of "celestial" games, focusing on the eerie beauty and poetry of distant stars, blackholes and mysterious corners of our universe.What if you could litterally unhook the stars? What if you could be a galactic-sized entity?In Devouring Stars you play a tribe of godlike entities trapped in Tartarus, a corner of the universe as far beneath hell as heaven is high above the earth. Hunted by 4 other tribes, you have been given the ability to draw your own fate. But to what extent?Devouring Stars uses a couple of unique mechanics to create a different experience on the RTS and space exploration genre. Your entities have the ability to "devour" starfields, creating dynamic nebulas that will protect them. There's no tech tree or building facilities in Devouring Stars: your entities are able to merge in order to create advanced units with special abilities. Depending on the set of entities you start the game with, you will be able to go for different strategies that will evolve during the game.Devouring Stars is mainly inspired by Dan Simmons' Illium but also by games like Homeworld, Eufloria, Starcraft or Faster Than Light.FEATURES15 advanced entities to unlock by merging the 4 basic ones (earth, air, fire, water).
