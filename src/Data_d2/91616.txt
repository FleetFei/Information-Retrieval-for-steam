							The holiday season has arrived to Elysion One at last. Skye has the intention of enjoying a well deserved vacation. Tending to the lovely spruce, eating, drinking and opening a lot of presents. But the aliens have made a habit out of making her life miserable, and this time is no exception...
						Will you take on the role as Skye, or one of her loyal companions, and help her get what she wants? Or will you passively stand by and ruin her holiday spirits?
						This DLC is free for all Sanctum owners!
