							A mainstay of BR’s locomotive fleet in the 1990s, the Class 90 was a replacement to BR’s ageing fleet of electric locomotives, and is now available for Train Simulator in two liveries that are ideal for the Great Eastern Main Line London-Ipswich route.In the days of British Rail, many high speed services across the UK rail network were operated by Class 90 electric locomotives, often in ‘push-pull’ formations with a Driving Van Trailer (DVT) and full consist of coaches. Following privatisation of the UK rail network, the fleet was transferred to private operators for both freight and passenger operations.A total of 50 Class 90s were built by BREL Works in Crewe between 1987 and 1990 and were designed for a top operating speed of 110mph (180 km/h), operating from 25 kV AC overhead power and producing 5,000 bhp (3,700 kW). The models were also fitted with a Time Division Multiplier (TDM) to operate push-pull trains with a DVT, enabling fast turnaround of passenger services and removing the need for the leading locomotive to ‘run round’ its coaching stock.After privatisation of BR in 1996, half of the Class 90 fleet were transferred to freight traffic, reclassified and modified to operate at a lower speed. The remainder of the fleet was transferred to private operators, including DB Schenker, Virgin Trains and Greater Anglia. The latter company now operates 15 Class 90s on services between London Liverpool Street, Ipswich and Norwich.The Class 90 for Train Simulator is available in two liveries, blue/white striped and grey/white. Features of the locomotive include advanced and HUD versions, accurate performance physics, prototypical braking system, cold start option, independent guard and driver wipers, LED headlights, a MK3 coach consist and driveable Class 82 Mk3 DVT.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Greater Anglia Class 90 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
