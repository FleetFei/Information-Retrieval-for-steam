							Mels is a cool kid that visited the Ronimo studio some months ago as part of a day that was organized for him by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The Make-A-Wish Foundations is a non-profit organisation that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions, such as Mels. One of Mels' wishes was to experience and take part in the development process of a game, and we invited him to be part of Awesomenauts. We spent the day with Mels showing him how we make games and we also let him design a skin for his favorite character. This skin is the result of that day! We hope you like it Mels ;)

This DLC contains a custom skin for Sheriff Lonestar in Awesomenauts.

All the revenue that was received from the skin between its launch and December 31st, 2013, has been donated to the Make A Wish foundation.
