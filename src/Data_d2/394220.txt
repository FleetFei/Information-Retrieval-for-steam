							About This Game
							A minimal, atmospheric space survival & exploration game, set to deep ambient music.

Pilot the last vessel of a fallen civilization into the vast unknown, in search of a new habitable world.

Carefully land on the planets you will encounter to gather terraforming resources and space-faring human survivors for the final destination... skillful piloting and the balanced management of fuel, oxygen & hull integrity are key.

Explore and harvest to create a beautiful and harmonious new world, but take too much and you might incur the wrath of sentient alien life...
