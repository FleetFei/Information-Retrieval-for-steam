							About This Game
							The playfield looks simple at first glance, but once the action begins, complexity unfolds at a rapid pace. INVERSUS is a negative-space shooter for one to four friends. Player movement is constrained to opposite colors of a black and white grid. My walls are your paths and your walls are my paths. Each shot flips tile colors in an attempt to block, trap and close in on the enemy. Firing a bullet opens up a path for you while also closing off a path for me. Both online and local couch play are supported. The competitive versus mode pits players against each other in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. The single-player and cooperative two-player modes pit players against endless waves of enemies as they fight for high scores on an ever-changing board.FeaturesOnline and local multiplayerCompetitive battles in 1v1 and 2v2 modesFight for the world record in single-player and cooperative multiplayer arcade modesTwenty-seven versus maps encouraging varied playstyles and strategiesSix arcade maps with distinct challenges to masterOver 60 unlockable color palettesOver 250 unlockable emotesMind-bending levels in ever looping worldsA constantly changing board makes every game a fresh experienceRewarding for both strategy and skill as you balance spatial control with quick reflexesSupported ControllersDualShock 4 (PlayStation 4)Xbox 360Xbox OneKeyboard
