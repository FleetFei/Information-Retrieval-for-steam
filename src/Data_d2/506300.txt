							Larry the Cable Guy brings a truckload of one-liners to his role as a big-city health inspector, happily going from greasy-spoon diners to low-rent ethnic restaurants. But his easygoing life gets turned upside-down when he's teamed with a stiff, straitlaced rookie partner (Iris Bahr) and assigned the biggest case of his career: investigating food poisoning at the city's swankiest restaurants. When his bad manners and unorthodox methods cost him his job, Larry is forced to go undercover to bring the conspirators to justice and "Git-R-Done!"
