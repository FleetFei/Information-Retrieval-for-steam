							You have saved Boston from being overrun by headcases but can you save yourself from becoming one?INFECTED! puts players in a race against the clock to save themselves from the nanite-induced disease that struck Boston following a failed experiment by two megacorporations, costing thousands of citizens their life and turning the city into a battle zone infested by crazed cyborgs trying to take over any metahuman they can find.  Finding out that they got infected themselves during one of their fights against the headcases, the players struggle desperately to find a cure for the Cognitive Fragmentation Disorder they are suffering, while the AI inside them tries to assert control over their body and mind.
