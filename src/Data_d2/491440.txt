I really wanted a game where I could be a dragon. Most dragon games aren't really about the dragons at all. They're about ... people ... that's right. And people aren't dragons, are they? It's time to have a new dragon game that's about, you know: DRAGONS!What are real dragons like?They're not your pets... or your animal friends. They're wild, majestic, ferocious forces of nature. But, they're not mindless. No - they're very smart... and clever... (well... sometimes.) Real dragons have character, personality, depth. You could even say there's a little human in every dragon. ( ... or maybe that depends on their diet.)Why should you get this game?Well... if you want to be a dragon - you should totally get it!Please, don't lose this chance to eat absolutely everyone!
