							Donner Pass Scenario Pack 01 – featuring 10 highly realistic new career scenarios – puts you at the throttle of Southern Pacific, Union Pacific, Amtrak, and Rio Grande trains on the famed and challenging Train Simulator Donner Pass route across the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California!Donner Pass Scenario Pack 01 re-creates the era from the mid-1980s through the arrival of the 21st century, a time when great change came to Donner Pass. In 1988, the Southern Pacific and Denver & Rio Grande Western merged and both before and after that merger, the influence of D&RGW on Donner operations was significant. Then, in 1996, Southern Pacific was merged into the Union Pacific. Throughout this fascinating era, Donner Pass hosted (as it does today) Amtrak’s iconic California Zephyr. This pack includes career scenarios featuring Southern Pacific, Rio Grande, Union Pacific, and Amtrak operations, and as an engineer on the rugged mountain route, you’ll be called to handle a variety of duties, from heavy mainline freights to locals, from Amtrak’s California Zephyr to yard switching duties. And you’ll take the throttle of locomotives as diverse as Southern Pacific GE Dash 9-44CWs and SW1500 switchers, SP and D&RGW EMD SD40T-2s, SP EMD Geeps, Union Pacific SD70Ms, and Amtrak F40PHs.   Featuring 10 career scenarios developed by well-known creator Gary Dolzall, Train Simulator’s Donner Pass Scenario Pack 01 will provide more than 9 hours of authentic railroading challenges!Note: Each of the pack’s 10 career scenarios require the Train Simulator Donner Pass Southern Pacific route (available separately) and select scenarios also individually require equipment from Train Simulator’s Sherman Hill or Soldier Summit routes (each available separately).ScenariosThe Donner Pass Scenario Pack 01 Add-on includes ten authentic operating challenges in career scenario form for the Donner Pass Route (Available Separately):	SP Symbol RVKCM 	SP Symbol RVAST 	SP Truckee Turn	SP Colfax Local	SP Sparks Switcher	Amtrak Train 5 	D&RGW Coal, Part 1	D&RGW Coal, Part 2 	Union Pacific Grain Shuttle	UP Symbol AGBMI
