							About This Game
							Caught in the wrong place at the wrong time - after visiting a performance of the closed ballet school for orphan girls, you receive a letter for help from one of the students. 

Upon arrival, you will find out that the girl, who handed you the note, mysteriously died. School students are submerged in a lethargic sleep and it involves something that is hidden within the building. Guided by memories of the dead girl, and the ghosts of students who died before, you have to pass through this school and find out what happened fifty years ago. Dive into mystical and mysterious world, save the innocent children's souls, and get out from that damned place!

In this Collector's Edition you also will find 10 additional levels, 5 additional mini-games, 5 additional Hidden Objects scenes and exclusisive materials (wallpapers, screensavers, original soundtrack).
