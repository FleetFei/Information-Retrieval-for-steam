							About This Game
							A luxury cruise ship crashes on an uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. The survivors of the shipwreck are very different from one another and decide to set up their own camps all over the island. Your goal is to find the pieces to a lost radio, and hoist it on the top of the volcano located in the center of the main island. While exploring the main island, find items and hidden treasures, and try your hand at fishing and gathering wood. Build alliances with other castaways to help you in your quest!
