							Plant seeds to grow guns!

GunWorld is a love letter to 8-bit action games, it's an homage to everything great about classic game design and action heroes of the 1980s! An emphasis on high challenge and non-linear progression means GunWorld is not for the faint of heart. Players will be challenged to complete a series of levels in any order they choose, unlocking new weaponry as they do. With each new piece of equipment additional options present themselves, encouraging experimentation and repeated level runs.
