							GameLoading: Rise of the Indies is a feature documentary exploring the world of indie game developers â€“ their craft, their games, their dreams, and how they have forever changed the landscape of games culture. Disrupting the big-budget industry, indie games have altered the art form through their innovative, varied and personal games. Small teams of passionate and creative developers are offering an alternate voice to players. GameLoading captures this pivotal point in history, where video games have become more personal than ever before.Featuring: Davey Wreden (The Stanley Parable), Rami Ismail (Vlambeer), Christine Love (Analogue: A Hate Story), Tale Of Tales (The Path), Zoe Quinn (Depression Quest), Robin Arnott (SoundSelf), Trent Kusters (Armello), Mike Bithell (Thomas Was Alone), Ryan Green (That Dragon, Cancer) and many more.
