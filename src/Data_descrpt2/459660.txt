							Album-SoundtrackYoung electropop and retrowave project from Moscow. Music post-Soviet generation of a time that will never return, and that its creators never caught. Soviet years with his aesthetics, his victories and tragedy were only in the records of television and radio programs, speeches of Soviet leaders, sounding a refrain throughout the debut album with a melancholy and nostalgic title "The last day in the USSR", literally cut-off any hope of return.TracklistIntroTimeHopeYoung People Listening To Modern MusicSteps Through the AgeLast Day In The USSR (Perestroika)Sunday StrollExplore The SpaceTransistor RadioNew Person
