							One of the classic early diesel era locomotives, the Class 52, comes to Train Simulator as seen on mainline rail tours across the UK.Built by British Rail for the Western Region between 1961 and 1964, the Type 4 locomotive followed the Western Region’s preference for diesel-hydraulic models, compared to the more usual diesel-electric locomotives seen elsewhere on the network and a need for a high-powered locomotive to head top-link services. In total, 74 models were built at BR’s Swindon Works and Crewe Works, and the twin Maybach engines delivered a top speed of 90mph (140 km/h). Whilst the design of the Class was largely successful, its working life was relatively short, with retirement beginning in the early 1970s and the Class being fully withdrawn by 1977 and scrapped shortly after. They were also never renumbered under TOPS, becoming the last class of locomotive on the BR network not to carry a TOPS number.However, their popularity has seen some locomotives preserved on heritage railways, with D1015 ‘Western Champion’ retaining its certificate for mainline use – the only ‘Western’ to do so.The Class 52 – officially licensed by the Diesel Traction Group – for Train Simulator is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to Train Simulator standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. The locomotive recreates ‘Western Champion’ as seen today operating rail tours, and is available in BR Western Region ‘Red’ livery including BR ‘chocolate and cream’ Mk1 coaching stock.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 52 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
