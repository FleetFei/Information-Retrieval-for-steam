							This DLC is only available to purchase in the USA.The SP&S E-1 Class ‘Northerns’ add a touch of nostalgia to Train Simulator – jump in the cab and recreate that 1930s West Coast flavour.After many years of operating second-hand locomotives, the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S) was granted permission by its parent companies, the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, to acquire its first new locomotives. In 1938, the SP&S took delivery of three Baldwin Locomotive Works 4-8-4 locomotives, numbered 700, 701 and 702. These locomotives, designated as E-1 Class ‘ Northerns’, were identical in design to the Northern Pacific A-3, except that they burned oil instead of coal.The ‘Northerns’ operated at a tractive effort of 69,800 lbf (310.49kN) and included a Walschaerts valve gear, piston valves and two cylinders. On entering service, they operated the SP&S’ premier passenger services, including the Empire Builder, although by the late 1940s had been moved to secondary passenger services due to the introduction of diesel locomotives and by the mid-1950s were relegated to freight services.By Summer 1956, all three ‘Northerns’ had been retired from service, with No. 700 pulling its last passenger train from Portland, Oregon to Wishram, Washington on 20th May 1956. This locomotive is the only one of the three ‘Northerns’ to have been preserved and can be viewed at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center.The E-1 Class ‘Northerns’ from Train Simulator, developed by G-Trax Simulations, is available in SP&S livery with two running numbers, No. 700 and No. 701.The locomotive is Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the SP&S E-1 Class ‘Northerns’ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.ScenariosScenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
