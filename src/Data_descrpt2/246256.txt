							Time to update your PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX techno and trance music tracklist with drum 'n' bass music. The first half of the game has more organic sounding music centered on real instruments, while the second half is electronic music built around distorted synth tracks. Oh, and the double melody of Pac-Mania is also included somewhere, so make sure to hunt it down!
Add-on included in the All You Can Eat Add-on Pack and Edition.
