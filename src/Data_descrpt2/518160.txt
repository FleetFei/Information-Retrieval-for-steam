You're the attack tank that gets things done.

And you have been summoned  here for a reason.

There's people to rescue, mutants to kill. Get in, rescue/kill, get out. Without any questions.  That's your priority.  Politics, flags, loyalties, or even the thrill of the ride, you aren't concerned with none of that. Your single concern is the meeting the objective, with deadly precision or else your failure will be seen from space.
