							Piper’s second generation PA-36 Pawnee Brave is one of the manufacturer’s most popular agricultural aircraft, brought to Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition by Alabeo.

Introduced in 1973, more than 900 Pawnee Brave aircraft were built by Piper, with a number of versions being built until 1981. Initially, the PA-36 was fitted with a 285hp Continental Tiara 6-285 flat-six engine, with later versions fitted with more powerful engines, including a 375hp Lycoming IO-720-D1CD flat-eight engine.

The Piper PA-36 Pawnee Brave 375 includes five paint schemes and one blank scheme, with two-aircraft models with and without chemical dusting apparatus. Notable features include chemical fumigation liquid effects, animated chemical loading and dynamic weight reduction as chemicals are sprayed.
