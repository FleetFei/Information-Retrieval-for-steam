							3 action games built specifically for VR in one package - Fracture (40 levels), Smash (20 levels), and Bowshot (24 levels).

Can you take down all 4 bosses, across all difficulty modes?  Or try your hand at PvP to see where you rank in the worldwide leaderboards. 

Arcade Saga allows you to take the role of a newly sentient being and battle for survival against A.I. Overlords determined to destroy you and your free-thinking. Through 3 different futuristic sports—Fracture, Smash and Bowshot—you'll harness your reactions and strategic thinking to shoot and dodge viruses, break firewall bricks and spin data-balls past the Overlords and their minions. You will need to use your reflexes, wits and changing strategies to survive.

Futuristic and action packed, this compilation game uses 360⁰ gaming, motion controls and positional audio with a nod to Arcade games of the past. Leaderboards for all allow you to gauge your progress against friends and family.
