							In most instances, “DLC” stands for “downloadable content.” With the Good Friends Character Pack, however, it stands for “Downright Lovable Characters.” Featuring the likes of Josef (Machinarium), Spelunky Guy (Spelunky), Raz (Psychonauts), Dr. Fetus (Super Meat Boy), Quote (Cave Story), Atlas (Portal 2), and Invisible CommanderVideo (duh), it’s a virtual tour de force of indelible indie awesomeness. It’ll run you (pun intended) about as much as a cup of coffee, and is scientifically proven to give you an energy boost equivalent to about eight pounds of espresso beans. Your heart might start beating dangerously fast, but your eyes and ears (and maybe even your nose - why not?) will most definitely thank you.
