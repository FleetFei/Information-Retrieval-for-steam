							From the celebrated studio of Thomson Interactive comes the new WCML Trent Valley route for Train Simulator, part of the UK’s busiest rail route connecting London and Scotland.Completed in 1847, the Trent Valley Line now forms part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML), which runs from London Euston to Glasgow. Central to the WCML is its 399-mile (642 km)-long core section between London Euston and Glasgow Central[1] with principal InterCity stations at Warrington Bank Quay, Wigan, Preston, Lancaster, Oxenholme, Penrith and Carlisle. The length of the WCML's main core section is nominally quoted as being 401.25 miles (645.7 km). The basis of this measurement is taken as being the distance between the midpoint of Platform 18 of London Euston to that of Platform 1 of Glasgow Central, and has historically been the distance used in official calculations during speed record attempts.The line was electrified during the 1960s and after subsequent upgrade programmes, now features a mixture of Mk1 and UK1 catenary equipment. Much of the line has a maximum speed of 125mph (201km/h) meaning Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 ‘Super Voyagers’ can make the journey in a little over five hours. It is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying more than 40% of all UK rail freight traffic.The Trent Valley Line was opened in 1847 to give a more direct route from London to the North West of England, bypassing the existing route via Birmingham built by the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway a decade earlier.Connecting the towns of Rugby, Nuneaton, Atherstone, Polesworth, Tamworth. Lichfield Trent Valley, Rugeley Trent Valley and Stafford, the line follows its namesake, the River Trent, and criss-crossing the Oxford, Coventry, and Trent and Mersey Canals along the way.The line was electrified in the 1960s and was primarily four-track along the 60 mile distance. However, prior to 2004, the line had an 11 mile (18 km) section of track between Tamworth and Armitage that was only double track. A programme of engineering works upgraded the full line to four tracks, allowing more train capacity on this busy route.The 60 mile (96km) WCML Trent Valley route from Thomson Interactive is set in the present day with full overhead electrification, from Stafford to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT).Also included is a Class 66 diesel locomotive in DRS livery, multimodal freight wagons and a Class 350 Desiro EMU.Scenarios10 scenarios for the route:	Class 350: Down Limited	Class 350: Down Polesworth	Class 350: Down Stopping	Class 350: Up Limited	Class 350: Up Stopping	Class 66: Every Second Counts	Class 66: Stock Move 1	Class 66: Stock Move 2	Class 66: Strike a Chord	Class 66: WintermodalMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
