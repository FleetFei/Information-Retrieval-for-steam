							Set in a sci-fi space station, Escape Station is "chapter one" of what will become an ongoing series of puzzle rooms. Current game play includes one single player mode room set on a space station with puzzles you must solve to be able to teleport out. There is no time restriction at present. 

This is Early Access and we will continue development from now until late November.
