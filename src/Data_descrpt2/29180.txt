					Enter the ambient world of Osmos: elegant, physics-based gameplay, dreamlike visuals, and a minimalist, electronic soundtrack.
					Your objective is to grow by absorbing other motes. Propel yourself by ejecting matter behind you. But be wise: ejecting matter also shrinks you. Relax - good things come to those who wait.
					Key features:

					Progress from serenely ambient levels into varied and more challenging worlds. (47 levels, plus bonus content)
					Confront attractors, repulsors and intelligent motes with similar abilities and goals as you
					Selected as one of the 2009 PAX 10
					Procedural content: play random versions of any level
					Sublime electronic soundtrack by Loscil, Gas/High Skies, Julien Neto, Biosphere, and more
					Dynamic time-warping: slow down the flow of time to outmaneuver agile opponents; speed it up to raise the challenge
