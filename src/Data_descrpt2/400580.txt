The last time she definitely remembers having it, she was walking in the Field with her friend Susan. Shifty hallmate Ashley had also been admiring the locket recently.Do you:Drag Ashley in for interrogation?Comb the Field for clues?Try to stimulate Jeanette's memory?Put Susan under surveillance?Solve the case quickly, and everyone will applaud your leadership. Be too heavy-handed in your approach, and public opinion will turn against you. Let a thief slip through your fingers to strike again, and the whole school's reputation will suffer.
