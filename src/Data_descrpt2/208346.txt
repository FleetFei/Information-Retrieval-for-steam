							The Class 158 Express Sprinter is a familiar site to people across Britain, and this classic DMU (diesel multiple unit) is ideal for running passenger services on your UK routes in Train Simulator.  


The Class 158 was introduced by British Rail in 1989 as part of the programme to replace ageing heritage DMUs still in service. With an aluminium body, the Class 158 was dubbed the Express Sprinter as it was designed to accelerate rapidly between stations, making it ideal for stopping services where new tighter timetables could now be introduced. With a top speed of 90mph and comfortable interior furnishings, it was also intended to be capable of handling longer services with ease. 


The Class 158 for Train Simulator includes three liveries, allowing you to recreate services from different parts of Britain.
