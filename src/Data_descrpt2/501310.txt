							One of the most difficult adventure games you will ever come across, Venture Forth forces players to uncover one of many paths through the complex cave system using minimal hand-holding. So, if you're looking for a casual stroll, this isn't the game for you. If you're looking for an adventure game that forces you to discover obscure pathways while being blocked by menacing and relentless enemies, Venture Forth will be more your speed. We guarantee that your initial play-through will be riddled with frustration followed by a rewarding sense of achievement when you find your way to new areas of the map. Death and dead-ends will be frequent. Figuring out how to best use each of the tools you come across will be challenging. Finding the Heart will be relieving. Finding your way back out again, well, that will be maddening.Best of luck, adventurer. You're going to need it.- The Management
