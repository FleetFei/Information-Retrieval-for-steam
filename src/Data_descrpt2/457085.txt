							The world-famous tropical paradise of the extensive Seychelles island group has now come to FSX: Steam Edition! Located in the Indian Ocean, north of Madagascar and approximately 600 nautical miles away from the African continent, the Seychelles consist mostly of coral islands with more mountainous terrain on the islands Mahé and Praslin islands. Mahé houses the capital city of Victoria, which is home to the only international airport in the Seychelles. It can handle commercial aircraft as large as the Boeing 767 or the Airbus 330, and is the home of Air Seychelles. This scenery add-on includes all all islands and airports as well as AI aircraft, AI ship traffic, animals, custom scenery objects such as ship wrecks and holiday resorts, free flight scenarios, and even a geocache mission. Please note that fuel and maintenance facilities are rare on many of the islands, with some airstrips being home to little more than a windsock and a shack to shelter waiting passengers. Take-off and landing can also be challenging due to cross-winds, short runways and creatures on the ground as well as in the air! In addition to the airfields, there are other landing sites like helipads or ships scattered across the area for you to explore.Features: Highly detailed scenery pack featuring all islands and airports of The SeychellesDetailed scenery of Mahe International Airport (FSIA) Detailed scenery of Praslin Airport and 14 more airfields Photorealistic ground and water textures Custom autogen models and buildings High density vegetation and autogen High resolution textures with baked shadows and lights Volumetric light and bloom light effects High resolution mesh for all islands Animated realistic ground traffic (airport service and passenger vehicles) Realistic AI ship and aircraft traffic with custom schedules AI Traffic included Animated wildlife (birds, turtles, seagulls and more) Pre-saved free flights with diverse flight and weather scenarios included Geocache mission included, featuring 50 geocaches across the islands Manual and Overview map included
