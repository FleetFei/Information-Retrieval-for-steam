Historically it was a WWII RAF airfield for planes such as the Hurricane, and also Oban Bay was home to the RAF Sunderland and Catalina flying boats.Oban Airport, from developer Sim720, has been crafted as a match for the real world airport. It features a high-resolution ground polygon model, high quality photo-real textures and custom made and placed buildings. Realism outside the airport boundary is also enhanced with custom auto-generated buildings.The add-on includes many additional features that greatly enhance the experience of pilots - accurate taxiway support, custom night-lighting and improved runway lights make take-off and landing very immersive, and when pilots have touched down an extensive range of 3D objects, including airport clutter and static aircraft, add realism.This add-on includes a separate configurator tool which enables you to configure settings such as AI traffic and scenery compatibility.
