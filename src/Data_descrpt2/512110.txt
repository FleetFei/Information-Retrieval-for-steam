							Cosmos Crash – The first person shooting & puzzle VR game of Viriver Studio is now online.In this game, you’ll be a space pilot with your ship trapped by orbits in the depths of the vast universe. By firing high-tech marbles, you need to make matches of three or more same-colored marble in the orbit before it reaches your ship. This early access version contains 10 different orbits waiting for you, think fast and aim smart to solve these problems!Spatial 3D orbitThe 3D spatial orbits are the biggest highlight of Cosmos Crash. Surrounded by various shapes of orbits (crown, pipe, balance, gear, etc)， the game brings you immersive experience as if you are just there in the universe, giving full play to the superiority of virtual reality.StrategyEach of the 10 orbits has different strategies to clear all the marbles. Special orbit like accelerating orbit (speeding up the pass-by marbles) and balance shaped orbit (requires clarity of both side orbit) appears as the game progressed.Special marblesIf you're good enough to rack up 3 or more combos, you’ll get special marbles that'll help you on your way. The special effect of that marble depends on the color of the last match you made. You’ll have 6 types of special marbles to choose from.MoreoverWe also prepared some fancy extra contents in the gameplay. For example, if you clear particular orbit area, the lanterns around the area will be lit, making the whole universe interesting!About usCosmos Crash is independently developed by Viriver Studio and is our first product on Steam.
