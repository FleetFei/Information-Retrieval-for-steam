Like any classic, even today, it still feels fresh. But it's not without its faults; it has an older interface that can be confusing at first. New players have to first set up a profile by clicking the Profile button, and then typing in a Player Name and Password at the top right. This name must be unique to the network. The only way to check is by pressing OK, choosing a zone from the list, and then pressing Play to see if your name is already in use. (Hint: it probably is, so try something unusual!)Once you're in the game, you can access the menu by pressing Escape. Change to a new ship by pressing 1-8, or choose S to spectate. By default, Ctrl fires your guns, Tab will Bomb, and Shift is your afterburner. To talk to other players, just start typing.If you can handle a few quirks, you might discover why Subspace Continuum has such incredible lasting appeal. Come on in, try a few different zones, and see for yourself! You might just find it's your new favorite game.
