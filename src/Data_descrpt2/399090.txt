							Solar System, 2908
Today, sunny...
But as always...
The sun is rapidly aging... It began to grow 600 years ago.
Scientists slightly miscalculated... In a few billion years.
People moved to the space stations orbiting planets.
At close orbits are civilized space cities.
On the distant orbits live criminals, pirates, and other rabble.
The cities are overpopulated; the level of living is low.
Constant attacks by pirates do not make life better.
It's time to get out from the solar system...

Do you love space themes? Excellent! Do you love hardcore shooters? Even better. I have something to offer you.
I present to you a fascinating excursion in the solar system of the future.
A game with a futuristic anti-utopian story â€” a hardcore shooter with RPG elements.
