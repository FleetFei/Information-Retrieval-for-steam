							When one-year-old Joel is diagnosed with terminal cancer, his father Ryan begins working on THAT DRAGON, CANCER, an artful video game to honor Joel's life. Thank You For Playing follows Ryan and his family over two years through the game's creation, offering an intimate, revolutionary glimpse into how the fusion of art and technology - in this case, a video game - can document profound human experiences in the modern age. Thank You For Playing is an independent documentary film, produced and directed by filmmakers Malika Zouhali-Worrall and David Osit. The Green family along with the rest of the production team behind the video game That Dragon, Cancer did not produce the documentary, although they are very honored to be the subjects of the film.
