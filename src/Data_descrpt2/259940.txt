							Reintroduce yourself to this classic YDKJ sequel! All the fun of Volume 1, but with completely different questions, host, and smell!

YOU DON’T KNOW JACK Volume 2 is the mutant offspring of the original award-winning, irreverent, fast-paced trivia game where you are a contestant on a manic game show. With all the excitement of the first game, lots of mind-blowing surprises, plus four additional question types, YOU DO’T KNOW JACK Volume 2 will scrape the trivia out of your cranium like the seedy pulp from a melon.
