
							About This Game
							To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the "Kou Shibusawa Archives" will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. Among the first released will be Nobunaga's Ambition which was first released in 1983. 
Players assume the mantle of either Nobunaga Oda or Shingen Takeda and strive to conquer the entire land (17 areas in the Kansai and central Japan region). They manage their country to make it rich, then prepare their military forces. These then attack and defeat surrounding Clans in battle.
