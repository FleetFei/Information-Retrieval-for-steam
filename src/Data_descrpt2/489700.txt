							Remember the good old Beat 'em Ups like Little Fighter, Double Dragon or Streets of Rage? Made in 150 days by one dude, Battle Forever is an homage to this games and to the days were your only worries were your homework and your supply of chocolate!

Choose your character and jump right into this arcade Beat em Up! Use your fists and your awesome special attacks to destroy your enemies and save the country from the evil Professor S., a mad scientist who wants to create the ultimate warrior. 

Set new highscores and challenge various enemies like stupid bullies or the infamous copier of doom! Try your best in 13 stages filled with loads of dudes who think they are better in punching faces than you or try to survive as long as possible in the Survival Mode. Teach them better! 

You can choose between four different and unique characters. Every fighter comes with his own special abilities. Shoot fireballs or freeze your enemies with cold ice shards! No face will be unpunched in this epic battle!
