							“Seven: The Days Long Gone” is a 3D isometric RPG in which players can freely explore the sandbox world of the Vetrall Empire. 

Set in a 'beyond post-apocalyptic' environment, the title will redefine how the isometric RPG genre is played. The climbing system implemented allows you to free-traverse obstacles of any height, both horizontally and vertically.

On the prison island of Peh, you will experience rich stories of conspiracy, discovery and betrayal, set within an unforgiving world filled with mysterious technology and dark age superstition. As a master thief possessed by an ancient daemon, you are deported to Peh on a mission that could decide the fate of all humanity.

Engage with Peh’s fascinating array of inhabitants, many of whom invite you into tales of shattered hopes and desperate struggles for survival. But don’t forget to watch your own back: creatures and people alike won’t think twice about abruptly ending your stay on the island.
