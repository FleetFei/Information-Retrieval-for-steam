That is, we started with the sole desire to craft an enduring game that we would personally enjoy.As Last Dream progressed and over 50 creative individuals became involved, we realized that other people might enjoy our game as well. Now, after investing thousands of collective hours in game development and testing, and after receiving such generous support from the Kickstarter and Steam communities (thank you!!), we present you with Last Dream - the first in a trilogy.The Last Dream Expansion and Last Dream II are currently in development.
