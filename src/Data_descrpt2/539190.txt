CuVRball is based on a few simple rules.  But it offers a high skill cap to enable many hours of enjoyment.  The core game may be simple, but the skill it can be executed with separates the best players.  However, even if you are not the highest skilled player, you can still contribute to the team and have a fun time.  Just get in there, blow stuff up, and make some friends.
