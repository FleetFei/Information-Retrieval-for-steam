							Leech life from their enemies and grow stronger over time.

The sinister dark elves have traveled to the Hero Academy from their shadowy underground cities, fully prepared to unleash their mix of magic and battle prowess to the surface-dwellers.

Dark elves possess the inherent ability to leech life from their enemies. A dark elf team will also raise phantoms from dead enemies to fight on their side; unwary opponents will soon find themselves overrun by a team that grows only more powerful as the contest progresses.

This add-on includes the Dark Elves team, 17 Dark Elf avatars, and a unique Dark Elf hat for Team Fortress 2 players.
