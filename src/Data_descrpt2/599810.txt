							Part 2 of our "Legendary Tracks" DLC series for Automobilista has arrived as the famous Adelaide street circuit is now available in two versions: the longer historical layout of 1988 (which hosted the Australian GP from 1985 to 1995), the new modern version along with its Supertruck variant.

The Adelaide street circuit hosted many classic season finales as the Australian GP and is still run today by many popular australian racing series, having retained a lot of the charm and unique challenges from what is considered by many to be one of the most exciting street circuits ever raced.
