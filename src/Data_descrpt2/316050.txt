I can't make any promises about where or how long Rodina will go (and I ask you to buy only based on what you see here now), but I can promise to keep working on Rodina for as long as I'm able to. I'm committed to making Rodina great, and I hope that what's already released shows that I'm capable of delivering something different, vital, and fun.Please try the demo, and if you like what you see and pick up the full game, all your money will go towards Rodina's future development!
