							Plain Sight is a multiplayer arcade game about suicidal ninja robots.						Fly through space, leap over planetoids and destroy opponents with your trusty katana.						Killing fellow robots lets you steal their tasty, tasty energy. Packed with spinach-like goodness; energy makes you bigger, stronger, faster and generally more awesome.						Being all big and badass is great, but in this game it doesnâ€™t win you the match. It makes you a target.						To win, you have to convert your energy into points...						How do you do this? Simple.
