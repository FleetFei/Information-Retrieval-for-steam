							From writer/producer Joss Whedon (THE AVENGERS), comes a sci-fi horror film unlike any you've seen before - or is it? Curt (Chris Hemsworth) and a rambunctious group of college friends steal away for a weekend of debauchery in an isolated cabin, only to be attacked by horrific supernatural creatures in a night of endless terror. Sound familiar? Just wait. As the teens begin to exhibit standard horror movie behavior, a group of technicians in a control room are manipulating every move they make! With their efforts continually thwarted by the all-powerful eye in the sky, do they have any chance of escape?
