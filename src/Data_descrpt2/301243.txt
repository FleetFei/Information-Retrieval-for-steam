							An Adventure Module for use with the Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletopThis adventure is tailored for the physically-fit investigator; the challenges include an expedition to the icy interior, the climbing of dangerous glaciers, and encounters with hostile humans and others. At the end of the journey the investigators will find themselves faced with an ancient stone temple guarded by an inhuman sentinel. If the investigators can gain entry to this building, they will find clues to the disappearance of the strange race that once worshiped here. For the less physically-fit, more scholarly investigator, opportunities for quieter studious adventures also exist while in Greenland.The original PDF contained three short adventures. This module contains only the first of three loosely connected modules.Requirements: Full or Ultimate License of Fantasy Grounds and the Call of Cthulhu ruleset.Conversion to FG by: mbabbs
