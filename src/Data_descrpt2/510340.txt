							Time Golf Squad is an indie RPG action game with golf-inspired gameplay, the plot of a 1980's sci-fi movie and a unique faux-pixel art style.Take control of four time traveling warriors as they golf their way across time, space, deep space, longer time, even deeper space and into the dark recesses of the human mind. All while avoiding hazards, staying under par and driving their enemies straight to the fiery pits of Hell.Like the 80s cartoons that inspired us, our story is too big to fit within the confines of traditional linear storytelling. Trilinear storytelling maybe, but it probably still wouldn’t work. All you need to know is that the universe itself is at stake. These heroes will need to use teamwork like a team to complete challenges across space and time.Introducing:Tu Putt the Brute — Strength, DurabilityHaeroneth Farwood — Accuracy, Mysticism1st Lieutenant Commander Captain "Birdy" Flicker — Teleportation, SpeedChip Rampage — Tracking, BalancedEvery character plays differently and can receive an edge by being customized with a unique inventory of special balls, clothing and clubs.Each mission has a unique location in both space and time.
