							Fully-unlocked “Trinity of Elements” blue, red, and green deck. Your opponents will never know what to expect from this versatile deck. Many of your creatures have haste, accelerating your assault. Your “bounce” spells mean your opponents will be busy recasting their spells while Riku of Two Reflections means you get double value from yours. With the odds so heavily in your favor, victory is never far behind. Additional content for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. (Requires the most recent version of Magic 2012 and Magic 2012 Deck Pack 3.)
