							The Boeing B-29 Superfortress™ was a giant leap forward in bomber technology and production by the U.S. during WWII. Design studies for a "super bomber" were requested by the U.S. Army Air Corps in November 1939, with a contract for the first two XB-29s™ being awarded in September 1940. The first flight took place in Seattle, Washington in 1941. Various system and structural modifications were made to aircraft following the early test flights. The B-29™ featured a number of firsts, including a fully pressurized cabin, electronic fire-control system, and a 20,000lbs bomb load. It rapidly found favour with crews thanks to its size, speed and range.Features:Full virtual cockpit with gauges and controls Accurate and functional Engineer's Station Bare-metal bump-mapped 2048-pixel texture sets Animated doors and togglable bomb load Custom engine start-up smoke (note: engines should be started individually) Togglable animated crew figures with period flight gear Illustrated user manual PDF Soundset by Sonic Solutions.
