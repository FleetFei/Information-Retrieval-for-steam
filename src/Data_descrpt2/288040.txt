An intense, heartbreaking story with themes of video game addiction, unsatisfying work and miserable solitude.Beautiful, original pixel and CG artwork invokes the streets, offices and sanctuaries of Toronto, Canada.Dark and moody original music sets a proper tone for the brutal indifference of real life.Important Notice
Due to explicit language, Actual Sunlight is not appropriate for players under the age of 18.It also deals with extremely mature themes, including depression and thoughts of suicide. Similar to other forms of art that tackle these issues, Actual Sunlight can be an extremely powerful emotional experience – before downloading it, please first consider what your reaction to a book, film or piece of music in a similar vein might be.For immediate updates on the game, please follow Will O'Neill on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/willoneill
