							Mayan Death Robots reinvents the artillery genre (think Worms) in a Mayan setting invaded by alien killing machines. Pick a robot from the roster and enter the arena to destroy your opponent's power core. Aim your weapon before the timer runs out, but don't be distracted by the pretty scenery: when the rockets start flying, you already need to plan your next move! Will you choose to move your robot to a better vantage point, or will you build defenses to keep your opponent from landing a killing blow?Features:
Patience is not a virtueYou never have to wait for your next turn. Each player acts at the same time, so whenever you fire a shot, expect to have the favour returned. Think Worms, but everyone takes their turn at the same time!Choose wiselyPick a robot with unique abilities and weapons form a roster of ten lethal killing machines. Nuke, zap, implode, incinerate and destroy the opposition with your favourite robot and fighting style!Practice organized religionYour tribe of tiny Mayas thinks you are a god descended from heaven, so they worship you and aid you in battle. Give them something to really believe in and blow up the enemy robot and his tribe!Muscle out the competitionThe actual Mayan gods donâ€™t take your blasphemy lightly and come to crash the party. Set aside your differences and team up with your opponent to defeat massive bosses! Feel free to proceed with the face melting afterwards.Care for the environmentUse your construction gun to build defences or create a vantage point to rain death on your opponent.Survival of the fittestThink you know what it takes to defeat your opponent?
