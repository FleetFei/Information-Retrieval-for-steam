							FTX Trees HD is a complete overhaul of FSX: Steam Editionâ€™s auto-generated tree textures, lending new immersion to your flight simulation experience! Developed for ORBX by Scott Armstrong, these tree textures are double the resolution of default trees, resulting in greater detail, and are derived from high-resolution photographs of real trees for maximum realism. They have been hand-edited and colour-matched to give a top-quality flight sim experience. New, optimized tree models reduce the burden on your system when flying over most dense-tree areas, with a negligible change in VAS compared to the default. Low-level flying takes on a new sense of realism that truly must be seen to be believed; skimming over treetops, over forests and along rivers has never felt so real! Your favourite airports will see a major upgrade too, as the surrounding vegetation takes on a new lifelike appearance. Airliner pilots also benefit, as approaches, departures and taxiing will be greatly enhanced by more realistic vegetation. Whether you are new to flight simulation and upgrading FSX: Steam Edition for the first time or are a seasoned veteran, FTX Trees HD is designed for maximum compatibility and will upgrade all of your auto-generated trees worldwide.Features	Breath-taking new auto-generated tree textures 	Double the resolution of previous auto-generated trees for greater detail 	All textures created from high-quality photos of real trees
