							Celebrating the 50-year anniversary of Caterham Cars Ltd, RACE fans can now expand the WTCC Experience with this exceptional series of classic sportscars. RACE: CATERHAM introduces a total of 60 individual new cars/car skins based on some of the most exciting models in the Caterham sports car range, including the Caterham CSR 200, CSR 260 and the CSR 320 Concept, a concept version with a grueling 320hp.
Racers can run the cars on two exciting new tracks: the legendary Imola circuit and the former GP track Estoril.
RACE: CATERHAM includes new features that improve the original RACE game experience: improved performance scalability, a performance monitor to help the player find the best possible graphical settings, and a new controller interface with more options for joy-pad or keyboard/mouse controls.
