							This is the Environmental Station Alpha Soundtrack (titled "Music For An Imaginary Soundchip"). This soundtrack has all the tracks as high quality LAME-encoded V0 MP3. This is not a mere sound dump of the in-game audio files, but a properly enhanced and mastered soundtrack album for maximized aural enjoyment. See the track listing below.01.  2:54 - Wistful Departure02.  3:14 - Valiant03.  1:52 - Ammoinen04.  2:03 - Onwards05.  3:00 - Sinking Feeling06.  2:22 - Submerged07.  3:28 - Spinning Dandelion08.  3:23 - Hesitantly Descending09.  2:24 - Sigil Summoning10.  2:04 - Stranger Danger11.  1:03 - Requiem12.  1:25 - Big Mecha13.  2:10 - Swift Mecha14.  1:51 - The Green Room15.  3:23 - Isolator (Final Departure)(approx. 36:36 total)Gone are the at times sketchy loops necessary for the in-game soundtrack, instead replaced by proper closures. This combined with some slight re-structuring means there is several minutes of new material available on this OST release!Two noteworthy mentions are the tracks 10 and 15. "Stranger Danger" is a bonus track of sorts. It was originally meant to be one of the in-game area themes, but was at the end swapped out for sake of consistency and perceived lack of quality. It is included on this release for the sake of curiosity nevertheless. The closing track of the album is a reworked version of the very original 2012 trailer song. This version is also heard at the end of the game, or well, the first minute of it anyway. For now only available in the full glory on this very release!While not a direct emulation, the soundtrack as a whole was originally conceived as a love-letter for the FM and Wavetable based sound chips of the past, which is what the title of this soundtrack reflects. Though sonically enhanced, the music still retains it's intended digital-analog grittiness as present in the game as well. All of the minute changes made add up to as enjoyable as possible listening experience.
