							An iconic race from Master of Orion II has returned to conquer the stars!

The lucky Gnolam join the original 10 races with their own emperors and advisors, new ship hulls and blueprints, and unique perks and personalities. The whole galaxy welcomes their arrival, just in time to face the return of the nefarious Antarans.

The Gnolam League is a tightly knit confederacy of traders based in the Gnol system. The title of Commodore of the League is the highest rank a Gnolam can attain. Any trader bold or lucky enough may come to hold this highly sought after position, representing the Gnolams in all official affairs. The League is well-known for its seemingly endless fortune, both in goods and good luck. Gnolams are cunning merchants and ruthless moneylenders, who would rather pay off an enemy than fight them. However, their vast material wealth usually allows them to fund large fleets in short notice should they feel the need to take the field.
