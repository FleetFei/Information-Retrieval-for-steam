							As the Space Hulk, the Harbinger of Torment, emerged from the warp it is discovered to be on a collision course with the planet Baal. Several attempts are made to change course, but all fail. A team of the Imperiumâ€™s finest warriors is sent to the Harbinger of Torment to try and reverse the engines or stop them altogether. Failure is not an option.

The Harbinger of Torment DLC campaign has 5 missions

Mission order:
1) Breakthrough
2) Heart and Soul 
3) In Control
4) Gauntlet
5) Surgical Destruction

Harbinger of Torment has been specially designed for 3 player co-op (you can play 4, but then one needs to play as the Genestealers), but can also be played in single player mode and versus mode. This is a very challenging campaign so teamwork is necessary if you want to succeed. 

The Harbinger of Torment is available for Win, Mac and Linux
