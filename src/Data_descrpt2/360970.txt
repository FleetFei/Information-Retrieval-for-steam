							This is the second chapter from the "Heaven Forest" series.While in the first game we explored the meaning of life, in this second chapter we wonder about the opposite: what is the meaning of death?We are born and we grow up and we step by step we come to terms with the fact that sooner or later we will die. So, in the end, have everyday efforts any meaning at all?


And again: do life and death have a meaning at all? If there is meaning, is it for the good or for the bad?
Why is death a presence in our lives?
Is there something beyond the physical after death?

The awareness of our own immanent death is a major feeling. But it's also the beginning of wisdom.

Throughout the game you'll find scrolls of wisdom that will help you concentrate and think at a more profound level.
The human nature will be unfolded once you'll find all the scrolls.The VR device is NOT required in order to play the game.VIVE and Oculus are the supported devices you can use.
