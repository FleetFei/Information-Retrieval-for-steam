							Designed by air racer Steven Wittman, the Tailwind is an amateur-built two-seat aircraft first built in the 1950s. Combining relatively low build costs with exciting 200-mph performance, the Tailwind proved a success and more than 350 examples have been built. Different versions of the basic design offer different engine specs and performance, as well as either tail-dragger or tricycle-type undercarriages.  The Wittman Tailwind for FSX: Steam Edition, developed by Lionheart Creations, includes both the W8 (tail-dragger) and W10 (tail-dragger and tri-gear) series model variants. The two W series aircraft both fly slightly differently, with the W-10 having a higher-performance engine than the W-8.  The W-10 will cruise at 180 MPH and will max out at 200 MPH, whereas the W-8 cruises at 140 to 160 MPH and maxes out at 180 MPH. Instrument panels also differ between the two models.Features:	Custom high detail instrumentation	New Avionics featuring an MX12 NAV-COM, transponder, and autopilot in the W-10	Full night lighting with soft glow gauge instrumentation for night flights 'without' the dome light needing to be switched on	Eight different paint schemes with several versions of interiors	One aircraft called 'Retro' features an early 1960's paint scheme and wood panel interior 	Fully animated control surfaces and various controls 	Front diagonal cross brace bars in front of pilot are hide-able with a switch for ease of flying in VC mode	Features high detail 2D panels by Bill Leaming	Optional Wide Screen Panels can be linked to Registry blocks in the aircraft config file for wide screen users	Ice box in rear cargo shelf opens and features animated bottled water and sandwich	Custom sounds throughout the aircraft	Hide-able top sun cover for the W-8, which features a fully transparent roof	Hide-able front instrument panel cover made of an old air chart map	Basic cargo displays outside of plane when engine stops running	Custom sound package	Custom flight model (aircraft config files) that feature a unique feel for the aircraft	Checklist in popup view, does not use Kneeboard 	Optional Wide Screen 2D panels for users with wide screen monitors	Custom exterior 3D high realism lighting effects
