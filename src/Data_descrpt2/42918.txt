							Magicka: Vietnam is the first mission DLC for the highly popular PC action/adventure game Magicka. Nowadays it seems like every game is getting a Vietnam add-on and Magicka is no exception.
						Magicka: Vietnam features a lengthy challenge scenario that puts you in the boots of a Wizard GI. Venture deep into the Goblin-Cong jungle, with up to three fellow soldiers, to liberate prisoners from a POW camp. Then you must  destroy enemy positions, escape the perils of the jungle and  return safely to the evacuation helicopter.
						At the request of the community, Magicka: Vietnam also features a new challenge map with increased difficulty. 
						In the Magickal jungles of Vietnam you'll have an array of Vietnam-era weapons and a  special Magick  that calls in a napalm strikes on enemy positions. Players will of course still have access to what makes Magicka truly unique – the dynamic spell casting system and a healthy dose of humour.
