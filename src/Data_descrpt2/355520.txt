
							About This Game
							Kalymn Nox is the Albino Hunter; even his pretentious and slightly racist title can keep him from waking up broke after a night of drinking. Join him as he takes on various jobs throughout the land which include:

-Spontaneous Engagement
-A Telepathic Lizard
-A Witch with a Poorly Insulated Castle

And hey! That was just in the Demo alone! The Full Version will include various additional plot lines, an updated Battle System, more Party Members, and even an Interdimensional Mini-Game.
