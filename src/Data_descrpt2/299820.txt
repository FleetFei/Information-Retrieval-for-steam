Water and food supplies are running low and I have to leave Riverlake.  I haven't slept in what seems like ages - I try and shut my eyes but I keep hearing strange noises outside. The streets echo with desperate screams and it's too dangerous to be out for long.  There are crazy people running around, attacking anyone in sight - it's like they are infected with some sort of virus. I watched one of them stand up not long after he was shot multiple times in the chest.  It's surely only a matter of time before the infected come bursting through the door here.None of it makes any sense.  I donâ€™t know how this all happened but I do know that I'm not safe here.  Where is the military? Are they even around any more?  I don't know what's going on and in the city I am totally alone.  I am certain you are still out there somewhere, I can feel it.  I want you to know that I will wait for you... Do not think that I am leaving you - you are and always will be with me and my love for you will be forever. If you read this I will have made my way out of here.  I will wait for you at the gas station just a few miles out of town. I hope I can be there tomorrow evening and I will wait for a week.  If you do not show up I will be heading north, to try and find someone - anyone - who might have survived this. Forever yours.Buy the awesome soundtrack of this game at http://davidfburrows.bandcamp.com/album/paradigm-shift-ost1 Blind to the signs2 Sundown3 Paradigm shift4 Parameters5 Geopolitic6 Ignore your programming7 Asphodel meadows8 Butterfly (Cast of Thousands)
