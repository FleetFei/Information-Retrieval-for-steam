							The Canadian-built Class 66 is a common sight across the UK’s freight network, and now the Powerhaul liveried ‘Shed’ is available for Train Simulator.At the time of the British railway network’s privatisation in the mid-1990s, many freight locomotives were bought by newly formed private operators, including English, Welsh & Scottish Railways, who inherited an ageing fleet of Class 59 diesel locomotives. With freight operations an important commodity for EWS, the company approached General Motors in Canada for a new class of locomotive.GM’s response was to offer a rebuilt Class 59, based on the same bodyshell but with an updated engine, traction motors and bogies. Such was their success that the model was ordered by several other freight operators, including Freightliner, GB Railfreight and Direct Rail Services.The re-worked Class 66 for Train Simulator is available in Powerhaul livery and features an improved cab interior and new exterior, accurate brake control and centre-sprung brake lever, and accurate engine and horn sounds.The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Powerhaul Class 66 V2.0 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
