							Welcome to the LightStrike VR Arena, where you face challengers that are out to destroy you before you can destroy them. Players stand on Game Pads floating high above the future world surface. Stepping off a Game Pad is sure death. 

The controllers are simple enough - a Shield and a Disk. Use your Disc to inflict damage to your opponent by flinging it at them and making contact. Your Shield can be used to block incoming opponent disks. Score points by striking your opponent. Player that survives, wins.

Activate a Disk, by pulling the trigger of your controller. This will turn your Shield into a weapon. Throw your Disk when you release the trigger.
