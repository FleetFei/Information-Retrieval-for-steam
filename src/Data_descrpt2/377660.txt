							Blockwick is a jumbled world full of colorful blocks. Connect all same-colored blocks on the board. Blue with blue, red with red, and so on. Don’t worry about the white crates though—they just get in the way.

If you get stuck on a puzzle, don’t fret. Just look for the hidden moon pearl. Finding the moon pearl in a puzzle will allow you to open the next puzzle.

The further you progress the more special blocks you’ll meet. Some are bolted down and are permanently stuck. Some blocks are asleep and can’t move until they’re woken up (set down a same-colored block next to it to wake it up). Entangled blocks are connected together by quantum forces—when one moves so do the others. Blocks that are entangled share the same symbol.

Eventually you’ll meet even more devious blocks. Sticky blocks are gooey and will stick to other blocks. You can't pick them up directly; they can only be pushed and pulled around with other blocks and crates. Caterpillar blocks are linked to each other like a train; they can only be moved with the head or the tail. Hypno blocks don’t need to be connected to solve a puzzle, but they’ll cause a lot of pain. The hypno puts any colored block to sleep if you set one down right next to it. Finally, flip blocks have six sides. When you move them, they flip to a different side, exposing a new color.

Oh, did you notice the strange glyphs on the ground? Each puzzle has three. Try to cover them all up with groups of linked blocks to master the puzzle. It’ll be more tricky, but it’s good for your brain.

That’s about it. Have fun!
