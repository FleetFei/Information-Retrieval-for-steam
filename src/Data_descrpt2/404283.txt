For this, the fleet of vehicles has been expanded to include the larger LIEBHERR HTM 1204 ZA concrete mixer semi-trailer and the modern MAN TGX Euro 6 tractor.The LIEBHERR HTM 1204 ZA expansion can be played both in campaign mode and in multiplayer with up to four players. You can find the new vehicles at the vehicle dealer after you've downloaded the expansion. Make sure you've got enough in-game money to buy the machines.
