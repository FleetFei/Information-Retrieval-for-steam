							HEX: Primal Dawn Bundle“On the morning of the first dawn, the Primals arose.”Primals are god-like beings that exist in the physical realm on Entrath and perform the tasks of creating and maintaining the world. The Primals shape the continents, flood the oceans, mold the mountains, weave the forests, paint the clouds, and scatter life amongst it all. In an age where Primals walk this world, it is imperative for any adventurer to be well prepared for the dangers ahead.This bundle comes with a total of 6 booster packs from the fourth card set in HEX, “Primal Dawn”. Paired with 10 pieces of shiny equipment to enhance your cards on the battlefield, this collection gives you the tools to withstand the dangers of Entrath. Additionally there are a few consumables and one of our rare cosmetics in this pack – as well as some in-game currency to give you a little boost.Install HEX: Shards of Fate on Steam to be able to use the contents within this bundle.Bundle ContentBooster Packs6x “Primal Dawn” booster packThis card set comes with a new keyword, “Empower”, and an increased focus on the “Constant” card type, complementing the mechanics already in the game from its predecessors.Equipment (PvE only)Equipment is one of the great innovations HEX brought about in the Trading Card Games genre, made possible by the digital nature of the game. Items modify your cards by altering their attributes or effects, and giving you another option to customize your deck. Equipment can be acquired on your many adventures, through victory in battle, opening treasure chests and completing quests in the campaign. Items come in varying rarities, similar to cards and improve or enhance your already powerful cards.Shiny CogYour Mecha Filk Apes have, "Crush."Ethereal HeadwrapYour Ethereal Callers have, "Warlock Allegiance: When this enters play, transform target troop in your crypt into a Phantom, and put it into play.Pyroknight ChainmailYour Pyroknights have, "When this enters play, troops you control get 0/+1 this turn."Infiltration SlippersYour Runeweb Infiltrators instead have, "When this deals damage to an opposing champion, create three Spiderling Eggs for that champion and put them into their deck."Ground PounderYour Smash to the Grounds have, "If X is 5 or more, that troop gets Crush this turn."M.A.P.

Which cards are you going to choose?Sleeve1x “Orc Mage” SleeveSleeves are not quite the same in a digital Trading Card Game. You can still customize your deck with a cool card back, but you don’t have to apply the sleeve to every individual card: just select one you like and you’re all set!Currency2,500 GoldGold is the in-game currency for HEX and can be earned in much the same way as equipment, through victories in battle, completed quests and challenges. Gold can be used much like the premium currency Platinum: you can spend it in the auction house, on individual cards, entire booster packs and almost everything else that’s put up for sale by other players. Gold is also used to upgrade loot chests through Kismet’s Well that rewards the fortunate with rare rewards.
