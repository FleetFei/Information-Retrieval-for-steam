							Caravanserail is an arcade-ish trading game. Buy, set a price, and sell. It sounds simple but it'll take you some skill to set the right price according to the market tendencies...

Inspired by the trading mechanic of some of my favorite strategy games like Pirates! and by caravanserais (trading posts in the desert where people used to buy products from caravans) I tried to recreate the feeling of trading in the old times : you have to let caravans pass, remember the prices, and deduce the market tendencies by yourself.
