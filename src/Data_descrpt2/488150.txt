							Ever wanted to throw a shield at your enemies with all your might? Now you can.Octoshield VR is an action packed arena game for the HTC Vive in which your only weapon is a deadly shield. Throw it at your enemies to annihilate them, but don't forget to protect yourself with it, or you will get hit by lasers!This game is currently in early access, please note that the current state doesn't reflect the final game. New features will be added, and the art and sound will improve. The game's price will increase as the game approaches completion, so it is currently cheaper during Early Access. But please understand that the game is at an early stage. It is playable and fun, and has a lot of features already, but not entirely finished. If you want an entirely finished experience with full content, wait for release before buying and add the game to your wishlist instead. You can also look at the reviews and at the Steam community hub to see how the game is and what updates I made. Most people really like the game currently but please understand that it's still early access.Read more about the details of the Early Access and the features planned at the bottom of this pagePlease don't hesitate to post any feedback, bug report or suggestions about the game on the community hub, or by email at contact@octoshield-vr.comCredits:Game by Anthony PigeotArt by Jesto JoseSound and music by Kameron Rogers
