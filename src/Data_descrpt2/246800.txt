When Joey and Gina arrive in the musically starved town that outlawed groovy tunes, a chance encounter with the music hating tyrannical ruler of the town (and local butcher) sends them flying. Now lost in the wilderness outside town, Joey and Gina have made it their mission to return to Accapella and put an end to The Butcher’s reign of silence.
