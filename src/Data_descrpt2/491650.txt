							The world has ended, Demons have risen to conquer the uninhabited and flourishing nature outside. 
It's your turn, with your unknown identity, to find your path for a new beginning. 

Reset 1-1 is a good ol' fashioned frantic action RPG platformer! Battle your way through demon hordes and gigantic bosses! 

Let's not beat about the bush here. Reset 1-1 is everything you loved about the late 80's/early 90's. It's a blast from the past, with a fresh spin. It's a great little fun game. Remember when games used to be fun and challenging? Reset 1-1 is just that. Enjoy!
