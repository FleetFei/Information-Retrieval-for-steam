							Chandra Nalaar’s fully unlocked “Unquenchable Fire” red deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Chandra Nalaar is a passionate Planeswalker who rejects authority and control. Her specialty is pyromancy—she’d rather set things on fire now and ask questions later. Chandra’s arsenal is fueled by fire and a desire to see her punishing damage spells burn away any opposition. With nothing left on the scorched battlefield to get in the way, the deck’s efficient creatures can attack unimpeded to guarantee your victory.
