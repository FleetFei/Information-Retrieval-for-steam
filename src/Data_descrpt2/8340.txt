							You may already know Strong Bad from his regular appearances answering emails and doling out not-so-useful advice on Homestarrunner.com. Now he's the star of a five episode comedy series, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People. With all new storylines co-written by the guys from Homestarrunner.com, you'll feel like you're inside Strong Bad's world. (You may even start to talk like him!) Each episode has a different theme and you get to hang out with with Homestar, The Cheat, Bubs â€” the whole crew. It's like a Strong Bad cartoon on steroids.  As Strong Bad would say, what the crap are you waiting for?
