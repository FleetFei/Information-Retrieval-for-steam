							Dungeon GenerationWith procedurally generated dungeons, you’ll never know what’s in the next room! Maybe a dozen traps? Maybe an army of angry Skullfaces? Whatever it is, you must save the prisoners and return peace to the Floating Islands.MultiplayerYou are not alone - just plug in any major controller and get playing! In Questria, up to 8 people can play at once!It will be much easier with your pals, unless you enable friendly fire for extra challenge! Each encounter will become a careful ballet of carnage!Don’t have friends nearby? Computer controlled allies will help!FriendshipQuestria is designed for multiplayer. Players can only use their special abilities so often, unless their allies cheer them on! Cheering is just the press of a button with no penalty. Sounds easy, but the Skullfaces will make sure you don’t get the chance!
