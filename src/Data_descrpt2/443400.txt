							This DLC contains no extra in game material. Instead you get an art book with over 60 pages of concepts and illustrations that we have created during the making of Medusa's Labyrinth. Buying this DLC is also a way of supporting us, which would be very much appreciated and also sends a signal to publishers that people are willing to pay for this kind of game. Who knows? Maybe your contribution will help tip the scales in our favor.
