							Rothschild: The Sheep will Wake is a procedurally generated first person horror game in which the Rothschild family dominates the world. The player fills the shoes of Jordan Baker, a journalist sent to investigate the hospitalization of Kane Rothschild. Little did he know, this rabbit hole just doesn't end.Overall Rothschild is 6 chapters long, each being released separately; but all being apart of the same game.  Once you've purchased ANY chapter you're also purchasing the rest of the chapters. We can't stress that enough, ONE purchase defines purchasing the complete game. Chapter Zero is the very first chapter, acting as a prologue to the main story and our launch for EA. Features:  (* = In Development)Open world environment: Within Rothschild there are no closed door or blocked doors. There are no 'invisible walls', and you can explore as far and as freely as you dare. What you do and how you go about unfolding the story is completely up to you.Dynamic Horror System: We take great pride in our D.H.S. which allows us to procedurally generate almost everything you encounter in Rothschild. You'll never know what lies beyond the threshold of light. Everything aside from the environment itself (in some aspects) is randomly produced to provide a slightly unique and different story for every player.Non-Linear Story: With Rothschild we'd like to tell the story from ONLY the characters eyes. This means minimal cut scenes to watch and high engagement. How you go about the story, who you talk to, and what you choose to say all shape your personal and unique experience.*Shhh!!: Plug up your Mic to you can be connected to the game! Make a noise, release a yelp, or murmer a cry... and they will hear. Although this feature is still being perfected and is in still in development we're very excited to announce it! And let your worries flee, we've prototype this quite a bit and implementation in a future update is sure to come soon :)*Skill System: Develop and hone your skills in Rothschild to help you survive, but what perks will you attain? Will you be a sly, stealth investigative journalist with a keen sense of awareness? Or are you more the type to be better at running and hiding?
