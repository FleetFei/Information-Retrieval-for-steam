							SILENTSCAPES is a collection high quality recorded and fully mastered room tones, ambiences and background sounds. The sound library contains both indoor and outdoor sounds and the sound editing was done to obtain constant and quiet ambiences.

All sounds can be used as the first and neutral sounding layer of your projects, to give support and consistency to dialogue and sfx tracks. Otherwise they can be used as sound sweeteners for existing background ambiences or sound sources for new sound shaping. Includes 36 sounds that are the perfect companion for SONAR Steam Edition or any compatible digital audio workstation with support for Wave files.
