
							About This Game
							Made with love, "Over The Void" is an experience, an exploration of a strange, beautiful and sometimes psychedelic universe. An original 3D platformer in which you will rediscover the art of wandering...

Each level is a unique universe to explore, but they all have a common point: the VOID. To get through each of them, you will have to find a way to open the doors which are over the void! Use the tools at your disposal to move in a 3 dimensional environment.

Beware: Gravity is your main enemy. One misstep and it will be quickly over.

The main intention of this game is to make you feel relaxed! Empty your mind, wander around, enjoy the view, the colors, the forms and the amazing music.
But still, you have to move with dexterity to avoid falling down. It's like having a walk in an abstract street with abstract bridges and caves, wherein you can throw platforms in the air and jump on as if you were dreaming.
Fly away like nothing else matters.
