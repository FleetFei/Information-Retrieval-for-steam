							Set logic aside to play the game where losing is actually winning and your character may be the dumbest person to ever live!After waking from a terrifying dream of your own untimely death, you attempt to make your way to the Finnigan Brothers' Fun Park for its last day then back home again in this all new text-adventure from CoaguCo Industries. You must survive 10 pages of ridiculous deaths and traps spanning over 157 ways to die with no discernible way to navigate to safety. It's like playing Russian roulette with five chambers loaded, but more frustrating.Warning, this game is reading. Lots and lots of reading.The Steam Edition features: All-new Choose Mode so you can decide your fate instead of the computer 16 new deaths not in the stand-alone desktop version, nor the Android or web versions Two holidays modes: Halloween and X-Mas; active on their respective holidays New game feature: the Saboteur A bunch of new achievements Of course, all your stats are backed up on the Steam servers (and CoaguCo's if you have an account)Now With Choose ModeThe new Choose Mode feature allows the player to pick their fate before each page instead of the computer doing it for you.  This must be toggled in the Options section of the game before it is active.  Using the Choose Mode feature will give you a prompt before each page asking you to input a number which will correspond with your death or success, then it will show you the result.RebuiltThe web-based version of the game has been rebuilt from the ground up for PC (Windows and Linux) so you can repeatedly die across multiple platforms, if needs be.  It features various graphical upgrades and sounds, as well as music from Azucar.  Much like the Android and web versions, various statistics are logged and displayed to show progress from the different platforms and should allow for cross-platform progression.
