							Xemo is a physics-based simulation of a humanoid robot.  Highly detailed graphics and a refined user interface allow you to quickly create new robot motions such as crouching, crawling, jumping, rolling, walking and climbing.  Combine your motions in a control sequence to solve the game's challenging obstacle courses.  Compete against your friends and rivals to move to the top of the leader board for each level.  You are rewarded for sharing motions with the Xemo community, and can continue to improve your robot's performance using better, faster and more efficient motions. How fast and agile is your robot?  Play Xemo and discover just how good you are.This simulation game Includes: The Xemo robot - with 13 joints with a total of 24 DoF (Degrees of freedom) Integrated rigid-body physics simulation The Robot Lab where you create new robot motions The Challenge Floor where you compete with your robot The Pattern Editor, which you use to edit your robot The Gravity Well, to suspend and position the robot in mid-air The Joint Editor, used to adjust the robots ankle, knee, hip, abs, shoulder, elbow and neck joints The Spring Editor, used to set the speed and strength of each joint The Balance Controller, used to add automatic 1-foot balancing control Environment and machine sound effects Leader boards - one per level Quadruped (four legged) robotsEarly AccessCome and join us to help shape the future of Xemo! We need your help. This first version of the game includes the motion pattern editor, the motion sequencer, fully functional bipedal robot and four game challenge levels. Our plan is to release a new version every month over the next year, with these features planned: Motion sharing through the Xemo game server Motion Sequencer finite state machine that lets the player create complex motion sensing and control Ghost recording and sharing (allow in-game playback of other player's motion recordings) More challenge levels (added each month) Evolution engine for evolving complex robot motion behaviors Learning Guides for classroom use Xemo.tv public website for playback of the best robot moves created by the community Player Scripting (Lua/Moon#) interface through XemoAPI for direct robot control. VS Code debugger integration Data capture, export and plotting of robot motion (joint trajectories, center of mass, rigid body position, acceleration, rotation) Robot skins and colorization Cool ideas for expansion from the community from players like you!
