							The campaign will tell you the story of one of the few officers who made its way through the entire bloody war. He tombled through the swamps near Osowiec, climbed the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, fought for his country on the banks of the river Tigris, was taken prisoner by the Italians, but escaped and fought to the last breath on the Hindenburg line.
You will be able to see the war from the perspective of an ordinary officer. You will have to fight alongside Turkish and Austrian troops against the Serbian and Italian armies. You will also meet famous historical figures such as ‘Lawrence of Arabia’.
And also, for the first time in the history of the GEM2 games, the campaign will include the mission, whose script was written by an ordinary player - Panzer Commander, in the contest "Feel like a game designer."
