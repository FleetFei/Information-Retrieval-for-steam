							"HEAVY BULLETS EP" by Doseone is a glitching, slapping and singing swarm of the soundtrack to Heavy Bullets.
A neon and nerve melting independent videogame by Terri Vellmann, about restoring order in HighRise Hunting Grounds or dying trying!
The Soundtrack and EP are meant to capture & intensify the stealthy yet savage experience that is playing Heavy Bullets.
