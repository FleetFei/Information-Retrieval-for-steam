							Scorched by the sun and hopelessly irradiated, the Earth is soaked in toxic waste and blood of its former masters. Those who remain are fighting to survive the endless and senseless struggle with the environment, and, inevitably, with themselves.Inspired by original Fallout, Krai Mira also borrows some features from such games as Diablo and Commandos. Though we focus on the combat system you will also enjoy wandering around, exploring new locations, trading and performing quests in this post-apocalyptic world."If youâ€™re a fan of the original Fallout games, then I only need to tell you that this game was made specifically for you."Shawn Schustergame journalist
