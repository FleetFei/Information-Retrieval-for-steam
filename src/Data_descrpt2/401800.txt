							What is BITKU?

- A simple storyteller
- A short comic creator
- A strange art toy
- A new way to express yourself in pixels...

BITKU is all or none of the above, and totally FREE with no IAP.

Here's how it works:

1) Choose a theme
2) Get 10 random cards related to that theme, each of which has a single background or multi-frame object
3) Make a 1-4 panel comic or story with the contents of those cards.  Add text, recolor anything, enlarge, rotate, etc.
4) Save your creation as a PNG and share it with the world!
