
							About This Game
							One day, the clothes rebelled, and preyed upon usâ€¦ 
Forced to flee underground and live naked, humanity could only hope the arrival of their savior, a knight in shining censor bar that would put an end to the tyranny of the fabric.

Embark yourself in a retro style frenetic adventure along different places, from the burning slopes of a volcano to the icy peaks of the north!

Defy unforgiving and powerful bosses that will test everything you've learned, unlock extras and customize the NakedMan to the absurd!

Would you be able to unravel the mistery behind this rebellion, and put an end once for all, or will you fall on your knees against a raging towel?

Your epic naked begins now!
