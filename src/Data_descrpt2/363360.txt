Interstellar Rift has been in development since October 2012. Conceived after years of inspiration from games such as FTL and Garry's Mod with the Spacebuild plugin. Interstellar Rift is built on our own game engine technology called Aluna, tailored to the exact needs of the project. Interstellar Rift began life as a project called AGOS. Split Polygon was founded in march 2013 with a team of five and development continued for just over a year before the project was renamed to Interstellar Rift.
