							Stolen Steel is a room-scale VR arena swordfighting game. Steal a sword and fight a series of increasingly tough AI opponents in pursuit of the highest score. Get extra points for stealth kills, and compete with your friends to see who is the superior swordsperson.

Currently features two VR swordfighting arenas.

Stolen Steel is a VR spin-off of an untitled non-VR stealth project from Impromptu Games. If it does well, we've got a lot cool ideas for where to go with it.
