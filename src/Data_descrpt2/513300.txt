							Schacht is a fast-paced 3D platformer, focused on speedrunning and competition, where you can use different game mechanics to beat a level as fast as possible. The game contains four tutorial levels where you can learn the core mechanics:Dash: The character gains an instantly forward momentum to cover large distances.Wall Run: The character has the ability to run on certain walls.Grapple: Grapple points enable the character to swing from one platform to another.EMP: The character can set off an EMP to manipulate certain barriers, platforms and traps.After finishing the tutorials, players can choose from several million different levels, which are randomly generated with the help of a procedural algorithm. Hundreds of handcrafted segments are the basis for this algorithm. Additionally, players are able to compete against each other in so called daily, weekly and monthly challenges, which are based on predefined, randomly generated levels. Goal of the game is to finish the levels as fast as possible and set highscores. These highscores are tracked and uploaded for each level. Players can compete against others in a kind of asynchronous multiplayer, where the best run of each player is captured and saved automatically as a so called ghost.To give the players a more personalized and creative experience, the game also offers a Level Editor, where players can build their own levels and share them with the community, and a character customization system with a lot of different accessories.Schacht was developed by a team of students of the Stuttgart Media University (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart).
