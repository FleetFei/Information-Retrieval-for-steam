							A relative rarity by coal wagon standard, only 27 40t coal wagons were built between 1904 and 1910. Though they were all essentially the same design, there was some variation across the fleet and a number went on to be converted for alternative purposes during World War I. 
The GWR 40t Coal Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes the wagons as they appeared in GWR and British Railways liveries, each with one clean and two weathered paint schemes as well as loaded and unloaded versions.
