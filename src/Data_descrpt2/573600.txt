							Little Bobby’s playing with a feral dog, the BBQ’s on fire, Jen’s eating poisonous berries and the birthday cake still needs icing. It’s just another wonderful day out with the kids, so... Ready! Set! Parent!Hauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering your children, the prosecution present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a trip to the beach, a day out at the zoo and many more everyday family activities. Play through each event in flashback to prove your parenting skills, and your innocence, to the judge.As every parent knows, however, looking after kids is far from child’s play. You’ll have to work together or fly solo as a single parent and make sure all your tasks are complete, the kids are happy and as few of the little darlings as possible fall victim to the surprising array of dangers that surround you.Multi-tasking mayhemThere’s never a dull moment when you’ve got the BBQ to tend, the tables to set, the kids are playing fetch with a rabid dog, and two of them just fell into the swimming pool.Parenting is hardTo get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you’ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and--ideally--alive!Nowhere is safeThe local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, runaway trolleys and escaped gorillas.All kinds of families welcomeSingle parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It’s all good. Parent solo or co-operatively with up to four players, locally or online.Plan the perfect day out with the little onesReplay and customise every level with the settings you desire to create the most wonderful day with your (potentially quite literally) angels.
