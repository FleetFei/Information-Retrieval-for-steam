							This DLC contains 5 music tracks created during the development of Steamroll. The first 3 tracks are the ones actually used in the game, and the other extra two are compositions based on the game theme but that were discarded because they diverge from the style of the game. They are great and really worth listening to though! The files are all in MP3 format. All the music has been created by Albert Munn√©.

Tracks:

01 - Gameplay mix : Steamroll uses a dynamic music system so we have composed a montage of the different loops in this track.
02 - The Scarabeus : End level music.
03 - Background Music : Ambient music used in some of the menus.
04 - Memories of an ancient steam machine : Extra track with a different style based on the Steamroll theme.
05 - Ride away : Extra track with an electronic style evaluated while setting the game audio style.
