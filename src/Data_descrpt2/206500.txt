							AirMech is fast paced Action RTS that can be played like Dota or Starcraft--you can battle on the ground or command from the skies! Practice solo, or jump into coop or even pvp modes. 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 plus the army you build to fight alongside you. Either command from above, dogfight with other players, or wreck things on the ground in mech mode.
