							Flight of the Paladin is a fast-paced top-down shooter where you play as a knight of valor and light vanquishing the nightmarish creatures of darkness. Inspired by the old school arcade-styled shooters, shoot your way to victory as a lone champion of justice.

In Campaign Mode, though your quest begins easily enough do not be lax in your crusade, Paladin, or you may soon be surrounded and overwhelmed.

Navigate through the deep Woods, take on the Hollow Path, and you might find yourself at the Castle Ruins of Dracula!
