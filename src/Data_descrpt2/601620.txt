							Room Designer VR allows you to design your room while standing inside of it. Draw the floor plan directly on the ground. Place furniture objects, doors, windows and a lot of other fun stuff into your room. Apply textures for walls, floor and furniture objects. Interact with objects in your room: Throw a pillow onto the couch or lift your cupboard and place it somewhere else. Take screenshots and photos of the ground floor plan. Save and load your rooms. *Coming soon*: Import your own 3d objects and textures.Home Design In VR Is Amazing! See and feel the room you are planning in the scale it would have in reality.
