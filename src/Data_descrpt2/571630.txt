							Welcome to Puzzle Island, a beautiful place where time stands still and there's nowhere you need to go. It's just you, the sand, the palm trees and of course the lovely ocean.But we wouldn't want you to get bored while you're here, so how about some puzzles to solve while the sun sets?In each level of Puzzle Island VR you're given various objects such as crates, buckets, balls or planks. Equipped with some of the most realistic ropes you've ever seen in a game, you'll need to somehow stack those objects to touch the glowing orb. Sounds easy, right? Well it isn't always. Sometimes the wind will blow your boxes away or the force-field prevents you putting that create exactly where you need it and often the solution is more challenging than simply stacking objects.The puzzles will require you to think like an engineer, keep cool like a martial arts grand-master, have a steady hand like a marksman and also think outside of the box like an inventor.But sometimes it does get a bit lonely on this beach, that's why Puzzle Islands automatic matchmaking will find other players that are working on the same level as you and match you up in a multiplayer session. But all levels in Puzzle Island are designed to work in single- and multiplayer.FeaturesBeautiful and realistic island: Perfect for presenting the capabilities of VRSuper cool rope physics: Swing them and fling them, pretty amazing.Seamless Multiplayer: No searching or waiting, just play and maybe others will join.No time limits: Relax, become one with Puzzle Island and take as long as you need to solve the puzzles.Future featuresWe have a lot more planned, please take a look at the early access description to see what's still to come.
