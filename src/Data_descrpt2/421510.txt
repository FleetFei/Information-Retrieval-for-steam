							Prepare for 3 times the laughs, 3 times the terror, and 3 times the fun in this third installment in the outrageously raunchy, rude, and raucous SCARY MOVIE series. This time, Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, Eddie Griffin, Queen Latifah, Regina Hall, and Denise Richards take horror film parodies to unprecedented levels of hysterically insane comedyâ€”with help from famed celebrity friends like Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, George Carlin, Leslie Nielsen, and a who's who of rap legends.
