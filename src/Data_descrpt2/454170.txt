The world-line Laedrum was created in year 2017 by a supernatural group that annihilated about three billion humans who had physically harmed other humans; that means criminals were executed, but also children who played tag. The crime rate exponentially decreased and police forces were no longer needed during the the so-called Purge. It lasted for three years and that supernatural group called Xorcerox suddenly disappeared. When those news were spread all over the world, the crime rate increased again; this time without a police. Drastic times require drastic measurements: The World-Peacemakers (WPM) were born. They are the elite of the old special forces from all over the world. Given special rights, such as freedom of act (and thus to kill), they try to maintain world-peace in a humane way. Now, in year 2040, there is a big terrorist group spread around the world. The current main mission of the WPM is to put an end to their terror.Sashiro KobataSashiro Kobata is the main character you will play in this visual novel. world-peacemaker officer known as the White Demon who colours his path in red, together with the Black Demon Qi incredible pistol skills with the special ability Reign of Bullets age: 17 has never attended a normal school before and only had private lessons his parents were WPM-officersConcept of the universeIn the XorceD universe there are infinite world-lines that are created by decisions and choices.
