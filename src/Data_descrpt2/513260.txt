							The miracle of a fully living and blossoming Moon did not last long. A terrible force broke loose destroying all living things in its way. Now, it’s up to you to uncover what’s behind the catastrophe. Find the causes and eliminate them. Travel the world and journey through many different epochs to solve the mystery. Become a mage and make amazing potions, find and master unusual skills. Along the way, you’ll confront very difficult tasks, solve fascinating mysteries, as well as encounter the secret order, “Children of the Moon.” This society, which existed in a parallel universe, has developed amazing technologies and achieved so much, which you will learn about to help make the Moon green and blooming once again. 
So, again in a way!
