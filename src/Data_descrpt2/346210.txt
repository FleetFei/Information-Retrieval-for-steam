							A serious menace has approached the gentle and snug garden, where various plants have been quietly living - masses of voracious insects rushed to it to fill their maws. The green defenders had to lay aside their everyday jobs to save their tiny motherland. But who will command the defense, who will lead them in action? Head this little army of garden defenders, rescue them from impending doom!
