							With such a ridiculous name and premise, a low-budget movie about a “shark-filled tornado destroying Los Angeles” was considered career suicide, but when Sharknado finally touched down, the Twitterverse exploded, and the filmmakers were asked to create lightning in a bottle again and again. What began as another Syfy creature feature has now become a major Hollywood franchise and an important piece of pop culture – poised to take over the entire world.
