							The music that accompanies Off-Peak had been stewing in a variety of forms for a few years before the release of the game. With Off-Peak the game, it's been given a particular context and function, soundtracking the player's journey through an original world. The games' themes and messages interweave with the music. As a standalone soundtrack album, however, the tracks unfurl at their own pace and in their own space, delving into the abstract emotional and sonic landscapes Archie is known for, deeper than ever before. The band brings its full instrumental arsenal to the table, alongside powerful vocals courtesy of Novelty Daughter, Gabe Garzon-Montano and others. The spirit of openness that has been in the band's DNA from the beginning is represented in full-force on the Off-Peak OST.Tracklist:Intro - Welcome to the StationFrogphoneMortified By FaithFick Yer MiniInterlude - Saturn In A Fungi ForestLevel Design - Sheet MusicRevealedArcologyInterlude - Spelunking the Maintenance ShaftsPanopticonMemosSatisfied ConsumerInterloper
