							Escape from the mundane or stressful elements of life with a trip under the ocean, where you can create countless beautiful reefs, underwater caves, and sunken forests.  Use a number of tools to sketch and build animated oceanscapes, and then fill them with different sea creatures, from goldfish to sea turtles.  When youâ€™re ready to save, export your favorites to share with others and even turn them into screensavers for your PC (with a free screensaver app).  The possibilities are as endless as the seas.Key FeaturesEasy-to-use editor to create endless animated oceanscapesSteam Workshop integration to share and download custom creations12 Steam Achievements to encourage your creativitySteam Trading Cards, badges, emoticons and backgrounds  to unlock, inspired by the creatures of Pixelscape: OceansAny future content will be free (no paid DLC or in-game micro-transactions)
