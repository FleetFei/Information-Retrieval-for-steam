							Pillar is a collection of minigames, where each game represents a different type of personality we find in people. Each personality is expressed entirely through the gameplay mechanics, without cutscenes or dialogue. All too often, we try to change people who are different than us, especially if they're polar opposites. We like to debate and tell them they're wrong and we're right... but what if there's a purpose for both extremes?A Little Bit More About Pillar:A collection of minigames, each representing different personality traits (introversion, extroversion etc.) through gameplay mechanics.Different people, different gameplay; each part of the game will challenge you in a unique way.Explore an intimate snowy town, beautifully hand-painted with attention to every detail.A distinct soundtrack, composed hand in hand with the game's design, by the game's designer, to ensure a cohesive experience.
