							Designed and developed on the emulation facility supported by VR technology, "Extreme Skiing VR" enables the players to experience the fun and techniques of skiing wherever they are. When we were developing the game, we conducted researches on real ski tracks and added some events that could not be carried out in real life to provide our users with an extraordinary experience that is both authentic and magical.
 Targeted at sports lovers, "Extreme Skiing VR" is a multi-player online sports competition game. In the game, the users need to apply certain techniques on the track while competing with their friends on speed. The game enables the users to experience the excitement and thrill of sports competition, while brings extraordinary and more vivid skiing experience to them.
 In the game, the players control left-right traverse with the helmit and use the two handles as ski poles gliding on the ground. When the player skis with ski poles, his speed will be accelerated. If he doesn't ski over a period of time, his speed will slow down until it reaches the minimum speed limit allowed. During his skiing, the player will encounter obstacles like snowmen or tree branches. If he accidentally runs into them, his speed will be decreased. There are speed props (the stars) scattering on the track. By collecting these props, the player could raise his speed, but at the same time the difficulty of avoiding obstacles also increases. So the player has to make the right choice.
 In the current version of "Extreme Skiing VR", the player could play independently against AL. In later versions, we will connect the game to the internet which will allow a maximum of 8 players to play at the same time.
