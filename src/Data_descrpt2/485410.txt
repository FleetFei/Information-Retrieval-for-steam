							In a faraway galaxy, an evil creature of alien origin has built energy-stealing mechanical machines on six planets. Unless all of those machines are destroyed, the planets will die and the evil plans of an unknown villain will be brought to life. The main character - a little alien named Lou decides to save the planets and stop the villain.
A long way to victory lies ahead of you. Donâ€™t forget about the obstacles which will try to stop you from succeeding. Jump, run, crouch, and move between three layers to stay up!
