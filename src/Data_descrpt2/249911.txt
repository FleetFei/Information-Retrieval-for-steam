When The Devourer swallowed the gods, that rainbow bridge crumpled, the colors separating and falling towards the earth like brightly colored crumbs.  These pieces were discovered by the Vaklyndr at night when they lit up the ground where they lay.  Each class has taken a different color and forged it into their armor, wearing what once connected us to the gods for protection and strength in their fight to free their gods.This pack includes:2x XP boost for 30 days after you purchase the packThe legendary Bivröst Armor for all character classes
