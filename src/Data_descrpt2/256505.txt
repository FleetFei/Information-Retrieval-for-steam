							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Starstorm expansion.Giga Sentorii is the combination of the five Galactic Turbodinopowerzords: Tyrannozord, Galactozord, Electrozord,  Fourswordzord & Grammarzord. Handcrafted by the elite Zurian battle team known as the Power Strikers, Giga Sentorii is only called upon in the most dire of situations. The Giga form is therefore rarely seen on the battlefields.This DLC contains a custom skin for Sentry X-58 in Awesomenauts, and comes with a fully customized voice set!
