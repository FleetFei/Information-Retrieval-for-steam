							The Dash 9 brings some heavy hauling to Train Simulator, and with a great mix of liveries it is perfect for North American railfans looking to expand their freight fleets. 

The Dash 9 was introduced by General Electric in 1993 with the model designation C44-9W, and the 4,000 horsepower ‘Dash 9’ proved very popular with railroads across the US. Over their production life, the Dash 9s have amounted to almost 2500 units across more than 10 operators on 3 continents around the world. Sadly these numbers are diminishing all the time as this powerhouse is replaced by the more efficient Evolution Series, due to stricter emissions requirements introduced in 2005. The Dash 9 for Train Simulator gives you BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National colour schemes and replicates the controls and complex dynamic braking system of this high-powered hauler. 
Includes:

The Dash 9 locomotive in 6 colour schemes: BNSF weathered, BNSF clean, War Bonnet weathered, War Bonnet clean, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National.
