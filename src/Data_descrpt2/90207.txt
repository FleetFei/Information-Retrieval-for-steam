							Farming Classics takes your virtual farm back to a simpler time! With 20 items ranging from harvesters to loaders, you can enjoy hours of farming pleasure with Farming Simulator 2011 Classics. Developments in technology and safety have changed the face of farming forever. Modern tractors have huge turbocharged engines, 4-wheel drive and air-conditioned cabs. However it was not always the way, and decades ago farming machinery was much simpler and involved a great deal more hard work! Now you can revisit those times with this superb pack of classic farm tractors and machinery. This expansion pack includes 8 classic tractors from manufacturers such as Hatz, Guldner and Bucher, and a range of classic equipment including a Fahr harvester, a Hassia seed drill and a wooden slurry tanker plus much more. As well as the tractors to provide additional power for your farm, the equipment included enables you to shovel, harvest, spread, plough, hall, sow and mow. Also included is an attractive vintage-style manual in PDF format. Requires base game Farming Simulator 2011 to play. Please note that the Farming Simulator 2011 Classics pack is compatible with boxed/disc versions of Farming Simulator 2011, but NOT with the Mac version.Includes:Bucher D4000B端hrer RP 21Deutz D80G端ldner G40Hatz H340H端rlimann D110Lindner BF 450 ASchl端ter Super 1500 TVL SpecialFAHR M66 harvesterBucher TRL 2600 self-propelled loader wagonAmazone ZA centrifugal broadcasterBavarian Plough Factory 3-406 cultivatorFAHR KH4S tedderFAHR MH650 chaff cutterHassia FS sowing machineKrone Optimat manure spreaderKuhn FA367 rearmounted mowerLemken D27/55K plowLizard trailerMobile water tank
