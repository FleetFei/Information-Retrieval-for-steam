							In Luckslinger, luck is measurable, collectable and usable whenever you please.On one half it’s inspired by the unrealistically fast gunslingers, the dark gritty humor and the greed driven anti-heroes of the spaghetti western classics.On the other half it’s inspired by vinyl digging, graffiti spraying, rhyming and the slow drums and jazzy samples of hip hop culture and sound.Do you feel lucky? – Kill bandits, steal their luck and use it for your own good. The more luck you have the more chance you have that, enemy bullets might miss, you get saved from a bad jump or better loot is dropped in front of your feet. However, when you don’t have much luck in your lucky bracelet, bridges might collapse, rocks might come loose and outlaws might find a way to get a jump on you.These are just a few examples of how luck affects your quest for fortune.Clovercreek and the crazy outlaws – The town of Clovercreek has been robbed blind. Six infamous criminals stole the town’s precious luck charms and it’s up to you to bring them back. Get paid the golden price while doing so, because bounty hunters don’t do charity work.Duck friend till the end – At all times you are accompanied by your companion Duckbridge. He returns your throwing knife, grabs extra health and distracts your enemies… but only when his tiny little duck brain tells him to do so.Key FeaturesLevels with different themes, unique elements and crazy boss charactersA completely unique luck mechanic that keeps the gameplay dynamicIntense gun and knife throwing gameplay that will keep you on your toesMusic to pleasure your eardrums that fit the hip hoppy atmosphere of the gameA duck companion who’s always by your sideGambling!One-on-one pistol quick-draw duelsConverse with the nice townsfolk of ClovercreekHidden goldbars for the extra challengeBonus hip-hop tracks by various artistsGiantbomb Quick Look video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QV73hikJ4sStill not convinced?!
