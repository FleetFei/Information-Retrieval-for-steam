							My Tower My Home Fight tooth and nail to defend the tower core –your home! In ‘My Tower, My Home’ (MTMH) players put themselves in the shoes of an unnamed hero to resist hordes of brutal mechanic enemies that will do the impossible to destroy your home. Kill enemies, gain gold and experience, buy upgrades, buy tower defenses, and build a strategy to counterattack. MTMH features a cooperative mode for two players in which our hero fights alongside Sommybot, a support droid character equipped with the most sophisticated technology. The style of play of the coop mode is designed to require a great synergy between players’ abilities. United, you will never be defeated!Characters are highly customizable in abilities and skills and both the hero and the droid have their own perk tree. This system gives the game a more RPG-like feeling and multiplies the possible strategies for the game in a great way.Game facts Sheet:1 player mode2 players mode3 Game Difficult levels7 kind of enemies 5 hero’s upgrades5 hero’s weapons7 Turrets8 Tower upgrades48 passive perksInfinite strategiesInfinite fun (just kidding, you’ll get bored after some hundreds of hours)
