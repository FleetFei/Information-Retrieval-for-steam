							Welcome to GTGD S2 the awesome sequel to GTGD S1, the video tutorial package that helps a gamer turn their dream of developing a game into reality. ATTENTION: With the release of Unity 5.1, GTGD S2 is now obsolete, so please don't buy this unless you'd like to see how to setup an Amazon EC2 instance, or setup a combined first person and third person camera system, or just support my efforts. I have a new series in development, GTGD S3 and it should be available on Steam February/March 2016.S2 was made with Unity 4.3.4 and the C# programming language. You can use the free version of the Unity game development engine. With S2 you will learn1. How to implement smooth Mecanim animation across the network even with latency as high as 250ms.2.
