
							About This Game
							First appearing in arcades in 1982, Dig Dug finally comes to Steam!
Dig up, down, left, and right and burrow through the earth.
Inflate and pop enemies with your harpoon to defeat them, or squish them with a rock.
Lure enemies into a tunnel and crush several at once for massive points.
Defeat all the enemies on the screen to advance to the next stage!

Perform a range of techniques, including the rock drop and the "pump and stall," using just 4 directions and a single button! The original and best "underground smash hit!"
With cute pixel-art graphics, vivid colors, rhythmical beats, and distinctive SFX, the beauty really is in the details.
This latest port comes with scanline and sound settings, and the option to switch between the old and new versions - perfect for devoted diggers!
Enjoy the masterpiece that fervent fans have flocked to play!
