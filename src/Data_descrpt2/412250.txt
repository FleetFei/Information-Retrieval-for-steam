Initially the player you will recruit ships from colony worlds that are barely able to scratch the armada of empire fleets, from this point you will proceed to upgrade them to formidable combat hardened battles fleets and eventually destroyers of worlds. The game turns from being a predominantly self centered ordeal, to a risk factoring strategy game as you obtain your first colonizer followed by claiming your first colony and beginning your own empire. Expansion and hostility will find you involved in galactic warfare with entire empires but this is essential if the player wants to obtain the ultimate goal of conquering the galaxy.-Features-GalaxyPersistentProcedurally Generated (Fully customizable)InteractiveVariable time accelerationEmpiresCapable of taking over the galaxyRelation dependent decision makingReactive AIPlayer is able to create their own empireCombatPlayer is able to take control of any ship in their fleet at any-timeCompletely Physics basedSlow down effectsBoosting and other abilities
