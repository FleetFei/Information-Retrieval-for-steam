							Wyrmsun is an open-source real-time strategy game which features elements of mythology, history and fiction. In the Wyrmsun universe a myriad of inhabited planets exist. Humans dwell on Earth, while dwarves inhabit Nidavellir and elves nourish the world of Alfheim. These peoples struggle to carve a place for themselves with their tools of stone, bronze and iron. And perhaps one day they will meet one another, beyond the stars...Features:Retro-style graphics3 playable civilizationsStory-based scenarios, playable on a huge mapDozens of units, buildings and technologiesPersonal names and traits for units, being generated from several historical and fictional languagesUnits can earn experience, being able to upgrade to new unit types or acquire new abilities upon level-upPersistent heroes, who carry over their level, abilities and items throughout scenariosPossibility to create your own custom persistent heroesNormal, magic-enchanted and unique items drop from enemiesVery moddable game, with a built-in mod editor and Steam Workshop integrationIn-game encyclopedia, allowing players to learn more about the units, buildings and other elements of the game, as well as their historical and mythological sources of inspirationNo microtransactionsWyrmsun receives constant patches, frequently providing you with new content and features!Note: Multiplayer uses a peer-to-peer connection, so that you may need to tweak your firewall settings or port-forward to make use of the feature.
