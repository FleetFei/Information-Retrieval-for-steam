							Serious Sam explodes into the second dimension using everything in his arsenal to battle the abominable legions of Mental’s horde. Pull the trigger to let the heavy ordinance fly in Serious Sam Double D XXL, a completely reloaded version of the indie sensation Serious Sam Double D with all-new missions, weapons, enemies, and challenges. Pile on the firepower with the revolutionary Gunstacker and fire all your weapons at once in a symphony of destruction! All that stands between victory and annihilation is a man in a T-shirt and jeans wielding a great big pile of guns.					Key Features					Serious Action: Unleash a storm of bullets and flame against an unrelenting horde of bizarre and ferocious creatures hell bent on bringing down the heroic Serious Sam. Clash against Mental’s army across 18 levels in three sensational worlds from the pyramids of ancient Egypt to the volcanic chaos of Pompeii to the harsh jungles of prehistoric Earth. 					Revolutionary Gunstacker: Duel-wielding is for lesser men. Serious Sam Double D’s new Gunstacker allows Serious Sam to stack any combination of weapons one on top another and fire them all at once. Two shotguns on a laser gun and grenade launcher? Of course. Four chainsaws and a flamethrower? Yes, please.					Legions of Bizarre Beasts: Clash against classic Serious Sam enemies like Headless Kamikazes, Gnaar, and Biomechanoids or gun down all new monstrosities like the insane Chimputees, oddball Vuvuzelators, and the surprisingly sexy Femikazes. Prove your worth and take down four amazingly unique bosses in epic showdowns full of carnage!					Challenge Rooms and Serious Secrets: Keep the action coming with a battery of action-packed challenge rooms filled to the brim with waves of attacking beasts! Get really serious and try to uncover dozens and dozens of secrets hidden throughout this wild world!
