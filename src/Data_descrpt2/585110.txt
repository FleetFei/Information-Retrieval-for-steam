ARRR!Welcome to the Dungeons & Dragons Lair Assault program! You hold in your hands a module that contains an ultra-challenging encounter designed to be played in a single game session. Odds are the player characters will be annihilated, but that's part of the fun!In this adventure, the heroes assault a pirate base north of Neverwinter, do battle with the servants of an angry sea goddess, and come face to face with their own mortality.

(Make sure your players know that!) Don't play favorites or fudge die rolls, however. The encounter is difficult enough that you can let the dice fall where they may.Here are just a few of the features you'll find in the D&D Lair Assault - Talon of Umberlee (5E) module:Battlemaps of a pirate ship.Pre-placed encounters for 8th level characters.Linked room descriptionsStats for all necessary NPCs converted for D&D fith editionRequirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the built-in 5E Ruleset.Recommended: D&D Basic Rules, D&D Complete Core Class Pack or D&D Character Customization Pack
