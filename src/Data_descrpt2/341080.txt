							NeXus: One Core is fast. It is challenging. It will test your skills like only a few games did before.  Ready yourself for a extreme survival run paced by an immersive DnB Music. Set on a straight-line futurist track, your goal is to avoid obstacles while changing your ship color to pass deadly portals. Play alone or share the control of your ship with a second player in a rad co-op mode. Either way, expect not to drop your controler anytime soon.FeaturesOne of the most extreme runner out thereExclusive Fusion / Unfusion mechanics (co-op mode)Randomly generated tracksRanking system with LeaderboardsA wide range of game modesCustomizable ships
