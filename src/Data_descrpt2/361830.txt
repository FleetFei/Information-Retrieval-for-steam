							in Space is a retro-inspired sidescrolling shooter that values precision and strategy over reflex or memorization. It's a round based, procedurally generated hybrid, combining its core shooter elements with score multipliers and colour puzzle mechanics. As you progress you unlock new ships with drastically different abilities, including the capacity to snipe, manipulate time, control enemy positions, become invincible or simply fling a beam of destruction across the screen. Advance through the games different modes that each put a very different spin on the core gameplay, and as you improve graduate to new and terrifying levels of difficulty.
