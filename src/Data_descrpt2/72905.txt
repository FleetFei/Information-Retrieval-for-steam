							The motionless voyage…						The interior and exterior worlds are made of hidden things – some are magnificent, others are frightening – all of them, in some way, are worth discovering. Is it your new life that is starting, or your proximity to the river? As you descend the mountain on the road to the capital, your vision clears little by little. For the first time, you are able to face your past, as well as your future. What do they have in store for you?						New features & content:						New battle mechanics. Motionless Tactics, Skill Losses, Stealth, Puzzles... and much more.						"Pyre Princess" Mode can be activated (or not) in most battles.						A new way of traveling, very… peculiar!						Some places have now an interactive environment.						More NPCs than ever, among which are hidden key NPCs of the game universe.						Loads of new quests.						Major revelations.						Hens!
