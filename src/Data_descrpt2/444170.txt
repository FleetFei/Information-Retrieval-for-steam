							PLEASE NOTE:1) While Unhack 2 features mini-puzzles, the narrative takes the lead this time around. I wish to share with you a story more in depth than that of Unhack 1.2) Unhack 2 is unvoiced because the script is around five times longer than the original. Thank you for your understanding, and I hope I may be able include full voices as my career progresses.* * *The Motherworm has been destroyed, but there is no such thing as eternal peace. With the appearance of a masked AI known as Program X, cyberspace has been thrown back into chaos.The unhacker, with next gen AI Neonya by his side, will once again lead Smash Security into battle. He is troubled by just one thingâ€”why do these new villains resemble friends who he thought were long dead?* * * Unhack 2 is a sequel to the first game I ever published on Steam. To cater for new players, Unhack 2 will start with a summary of the original title. Thank you! I hope you will find the experience worthwhile.
