							When Rocco was forced to leave the Intergalactic Police Department, he disappeared without a trace.

With Rocco out of the picture, his former enemies were emboldened and tightened their grip on the citizens living the densely populated residential areas of Ribbit IV. They soon learned to fear the shadows that once provided them with safety when rumor spread of a new, hooded figure dispensing justice to the injust.

Where they were once hunted by Rocco the Lawman by day, they were now hunted by Shinobi Rocco by night. They say Evil never sleeps, but they never told you that's because the Righteous made Evil afraid of the dark.

This DLC contains a custom skin for Rocco in Awesomenauts, and will automatically unlock the character if you have not already done so.
