							This story is based on Russian imageboard culture. 
You are a nerdy /b/tard, who always stays at home. 
One day someone sends you a link to a weird website, upon going to which you are teleported into a mysterious island, populated by several hostile fractions. You need to choose between the two conflicting forces in order to get rich, to overcome your nature or just to survive. You can loot caravans.
