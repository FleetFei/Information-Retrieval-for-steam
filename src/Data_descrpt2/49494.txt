							Fully-unlocked “Forest’s Fury” green deck. Call upon nature’s mightiest guardians, the towering Treefolk, to crush your enemies underfoot. The sprawling forest provides abundant mana to summon massive creatures. Against most other decks, these creatures will already be larger and more powerful. But when you add in devastating spells like Rancor that make them even deadlier, no one will be able to stand against you for long. Additional content for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. (Requires the most recent version of Magic 2012 and Magic 2012 Deck Pack 2.)
