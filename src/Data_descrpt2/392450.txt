							The captain has told you to visit Twin Peaks? No Silver Creek Falls. You arrive at your first crime scene. There is blood all over the floor and everywhere you would expect and even where you could not possibly expect! You have been assigned as the police detective for this special case with a new partner. Everything about this day is foreign to you including your newly assigned partner.    

Two city detectives are sent to a small idyllic town in North Carolina called ‘Silver Creek Falls” to investigate a strange series of events that the local sheriff can’t seem to get his mind around. What initially seems like an open-and-shut case unfolds into a truly terrifying mystery that will leave the detectives wondering what is real and what isn’t.
