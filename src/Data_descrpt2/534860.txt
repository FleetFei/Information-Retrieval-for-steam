The 30km track from Bad Vilbel to Stockheim was originally built by PÃ¤ngel_Anton and was upgraded to current standards in track design.
Finally a new German community was created for Trainz-Multiplayer where you get all news and information. Make sure to visit us www.trainz-multiplayer.de

Once purchased (for free) this route will then be added to your account for you to download in-game next time you start Trainz Driver (or click File > Download Purchased items to refresh your listing if required).
