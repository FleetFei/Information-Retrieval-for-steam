							A collaboration between Dead Gentlemen Productions and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, this fan-funded series has thrilled and entertained audiences since 2010. Following the adventures of Perf, a dyslexic wizard, Nara, an elf seeking the destiny she is owed, Carrow, a cleric with a minor death problem, and Glorion, a fighter who mistakes slaughter for bravery, this first season introduces the stakes—a foul-mouthed sword of destiny who wants a new owner—that will escalate into a major power struggle in seasons two and three.

Featuring Dead Gentlemen's trademark combination of laugh-out-loud humor and sympathetic characters, this season investigates the idiosyncrasies of the orcish language, exactly how bards get the drop on the best stories, and the best way to beat a trap-ridden dungeon. This uninterrupted cut of the show presents the story as the creators intended.

Seasons One and Two are currently available on Steam through HD streaming. Season Three is currently funding on Kickstarter and is slated to begin production in April of 2016.
