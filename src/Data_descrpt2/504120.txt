Drafting: Master a collection of essential tools used to create and manipulate 2D objects, including curves, text and annotations. Add symbols, apply BOMs and draw views. Surface Modeling: Use surface construction utility tools for skinning and lofting, covering, nets, and sweeps. Apply surface utility tools to cut, intersect, project, trim or rebuild surfaces. Solid Modeling: Build objects that are closed bodies with well-defined mass properties. Make primitives for truncated cones and elliptical cylinders, and access primitive control points. Control gaps, overlaps and more. Rendering and Display: Create and manipulate CAD shapes for curves and surfaces. Define resolution angles and defaults. Explore options for viewing data. Photo Realistic Rendering: Generate an image from a scene that contains CAD shapes combined with texture, lighting and shading information. Use photo-rendering to produce impressive visual realism. Adjust angles to applied materials. Data Sharing: Share your designs with other applications in a variety of data formats, including surface and solid model, and facet based. Explore exporting options, extensions and other data sharing methods.
