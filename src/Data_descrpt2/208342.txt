							The GE 44-ton switcher is a compact, hard-working switching locomotive first built in the 1940s, and is now available as a Union Pacific Railroad switcher for the Cajon Pass. The GE 44-tonner was built by General Electric at the beginning of the transition from steam to diesel traction in North America. Because of labour agreements at the time which stipulated a second crewman in the cab of locomotives more than 44-tons in weight, the GE 44 was built to come in under the weight threshold and thus save money on man power. More than 350 examples were built up until 1956, with various power units being fitted over the years, and around 20 still exist in preservation across the US and beyond. Developed for Train Simulator by Digital Train Models, this GE 44-ton switcher comes in Union Pacific livery with scenarios for the  Cajon Pass  route.Includes:General Electric 44-Tonner switcher diesel locomotive in Union Pacific orange and grey livery, featuring opening cab doors and windows.Scenarios4 scenarios for the Cajon Pass, Barstow-San Bernadino:Thorn DeliveryLoading in Oro GrandeTask in San BernadinoUnloads Auxiliary
