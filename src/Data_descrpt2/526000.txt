Please note: The items from your Mortal and Immortal Editions are NOT automatically credited to your game account during Early Access. Instead you will get a DLC key to redeem in-game.
- check your DLCs for Guardians of Ember and take the DLC key from there
- Log into the game
- Open the Frozen Ember Shop via the blue crystal icon located on top row of the screen
- Navigate to "voucher" on the left side of the shop window
- Insert the voucher to unlock your perk

-> there might be an issue with copy&paste directly from steam, maybe write it down or copy to editor first

-> enter 0 in the key field

Attention: 
- The Items will only be given once and not for each character!
- Only one Immortal DLC is redeemable per game account!
