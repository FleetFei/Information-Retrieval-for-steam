							We are once again very proud to present the followup to the highly-successful High Fantasy Resource Bundle: The High Fantasy Resource Bundle II! We have learned a lot from the first Bundle, and have developed new techniques to create even higher-quality sprites and resources for your Fantasy RPG needs! As always, our primary goal is to help you tell the story you want to tell. This bundle has a HUGE amount of graphical resources aimed at doing just that. This bundle contains everything you see in the screenshots and A LOT MORE! 60 Battle Backgrounds and Parallax ImagesNearly 600(!!!) character sprite sheets (most characters have a primary 4-direction sprite sheet, an additional sprite sheet for 8-directions, and a pose sprite sheet primarily for down poses).216 Character Face Portraits!146 Front-View Battlers and 145 Side-View Battlers (that is about 50% more than the first Bundle!)3 brand-new graphical overlays for Torch Light, Lamp Light, and No Light for dungeons.41 Tile Sheets, including 13 Auto-Tile sheets!Bonus Script included for RPGMaker VX Ace!All resources have been formatted for quick and easy use in RPG Maker VX and RPG Maker VX Ace, though will work with other RPG Maker products and game-making software as well, though may require some format editing depending.We truly hope that you enjoy these resources and they help you tell the story that you want to tell. Moving forward, keep an eye out for additional resources coming in the not-too-distant future, including a Monster Expansion Pack (because you can never have enough bad guys!) and the first in a series of 'Main Party' Packs, which will include some very awesome resources to create your central main party (and will include animated battler sprite sheets in the extremely popular Holder's format, for quick and easy use with all current scripts!)As always, we thank you from the depths of our RPG-Loving souls,Megan and JessePioneer Valley Games
