							It's the dawn of superpowers! Grab a cape and stand with the first generation of heroes as they struggle to join society and vanquish a criminal conspiracy, or lay the foundation to become the first villain."The Best of Us" is an interactive novel by Teo Kuusela, author of "Lords of Aswick." Your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--127,000 words, without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Choose your powers: freeze your opponents, or carry them to the skies. Don your very own hero uniform and save the city of Pacifica. Face your fellow heroes and uncover a conspiracy. Decide the future of heroes: dangerous vigilantes, or paragons of justice? Lay the foundation for a better future, and perhaps profit from it as well.
