
							About This Game
							VilleTown is a City-Building Tower Defense game, where the player researches Technologies, Artifacts, and special Powers to help grow, expand, and defend their VilleTown from outside invaders.

The story of VilleTown follows the voyage of a group of Pilgrims in the Middle Ages, who venture out to an Island that they have heard many stories about. While people tell of its untold riches, they also say there is something dark linked to the island, as there once was an Ancient Civilization there that performed Dark Rituals. Ignoring this, the pilgrims head out to the Island to start their new lives.

Be sure to lead them to prosperity as you build, grow, and advance your VilleTown through the ages, Governor.
