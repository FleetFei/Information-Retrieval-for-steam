							CONTAINER PRODUCTS – 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERSSome months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers. From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic. Now, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers in your railroad world. You are able to carry them by X2K double-stack container well wagons.Features Include:- 10 styles.- Normal Maps.- Weathered. X2K DOUBLE-STACK CONTAINER WELL WAGONSIf you intend to travel between Shanghai and Beijing by train, maybe you'll pass a train with double-stacked containers - chances are it will be these, as the X2 series well wagons are the only double-stack container wagons in China. The X2 series double-stack container well wagon is specially designed to carry container traffic. Once a X2 wagon equips ZK6 bogies, it’s called “X2K”, and its max speed is up to 120 km/h. Three colors of X2K wagons are included, which should be mixed in a long train for a more realistic effect!Features Include:- Normal Maps.- Weathered.- Rear Sign Light.- Load Product.- LOD System.CONTAINER YARDNeed a place to show off your containers?
