							But stairs and chairs aren’t your only obstacles. Dozens of different enemies will stand in the way of your goal. While ants and rats may not be the smartest creatures, being swarmed by hordes of them will make life extremely difficult for our little friend. Luckily, you and Tyler are equipped with a variety of different weapons, from your trusty bolt-blade to boxing gloves. Samurai swords! Sticks! Cherry bombs! All of it will allow you to carve your way through the pests that have infested your home while your creator has been missing. Tyler’s relying on your help, so use every tool you discover to find the right combination for you.
