							This is the official release of the Until I Have You Soundtrack.

The soundtracks comprises of two file-types, MP3 (320 kbps Constant Bit Rate) and FLAC (Loss-less at 8 compression level). The entirety of the soundtrack is 34 files (68 total) and contains all the songs featured in the game. This has been a big passion for me, as I spent a lot of time composing, and it makes me very happy to see that so far it has been received so well. The main influences on this have been Lazerhawk, Hans Zimmer's Interstellar, Miami Nights, Garth Knight, and Tangerine Dream.
