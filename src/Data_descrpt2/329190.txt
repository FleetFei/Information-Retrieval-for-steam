							Take to the skies and fly past mountains in a wingsuit. Try to hug the cliffs at over 250 km/h or cruise at high altitudes and admire the scenery.Your body and gear are fully physically simulated. You fly by controlling your character's muscles directly, which changes your pose, which interacts with the air around you. You can see, hear, and feel every gust of wind as you pass it.The current version already has a lot to play around with:A single, finely tuned wingsuit to fly withA huge landscape inspired by the Swiss and French Alps, with lots of lines to tryDynamic time and weather that is also completely customizableMultiple camera perspectives (including first-person view)Highly configurable graphics and input settingsTime Trials that push your skills to the limitGamepad or Joystick recommended!Note: VR Support in v3.6 is broken right now, so you might want to hold off until v3.7 is out. Sorry for the inconvenience!
