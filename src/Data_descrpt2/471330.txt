							Versus is a fast action twin-stick shooter from the creator of Nation Red. Create your own diorama arena sandbox before doing battle with thousands of enemies in fast-paced top down combat. Face up to a dozen bosses. Simultaneously. Play in single player, on-line or local coop with up to 4 players.

Set up your player class, attributes and weaponry, then choose your map setting and build barricades, tactically place explosives, sentry guns, ammo and medical kit stockpiles, weapon stations and more.

Build defenses or keep the map free-roam with only weapon stations and sentry guns.

Then hit the Play button to battle it out in Free Play or Tactical Mode, alone or with friends and survive against 360-degree enemy attack or defend one or more breach points.
Save your diorama map to disk or Steam Cloud to play later or rearrange your defenses after a defeat to try a different tactical approach.

During your play earn dozens of perks ranging from increased weapon accuracy to setting up drone strikes.

Versus supports leaderboards, per-game and lifetime player and weapon stats, achievements, custom map making and more.

Try it, build a diorama and see how long you survive on your own map!
