							Medianne Phirtia, a student residing in the region of Midgard. 
She has long held an admiration for 'Celestria' â€” a place spoken of in fairy tales where users of magic reside. 

During breaks from her studies, Medianne perused literature and documents about those fairy tales. It didn't take her long to determine that the fairy tales were more than stories! 

Yes... The mysterious 'Phantasm Tower' in the very center of the world is the very entrance to Celestria!!
