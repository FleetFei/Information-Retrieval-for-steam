							This skin requires the Awesomenauts base game AND the Awesomenauts: Overdrive expansion to use in-game.The servants of Kethkar had gathered in the deepest, most sacred room of the hidden refuge known as the Blood Halls. There they awaited word from the Blood God, who would give all of them a purpose in this world.And from his throne, Kethkar spoke to the first of them, a Wraithlord: "You will be my hand, and strike the non-believers from this world!". He then turned to Max, and spoke "And you will be my eyes! Find the non-believers and spy on them! Reveal their secrets to me!" And so Max found his new purpose, having reported on the news across many different worlds in the years before, he would now forevermore use his skills in service of the Blood God.This DLC contains a custom skin for Max Focus in Awesomenauts, and comes with a fully customized voice set!
