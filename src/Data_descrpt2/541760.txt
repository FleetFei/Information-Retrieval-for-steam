							[Important: Please read before purchasing]  Due to financial constraints, I'm currently unable to work on The Frontier full-time. I have no plans to cancel or stop working on the game; however, this will result in much slower and more inconsistent progress. If you're thinking about buying The Frontier, please bear this in mind and base your decision on how much you think you will enjoy the game in its current state.The Frontier is a blend between business simulation and survival, exploration games.
