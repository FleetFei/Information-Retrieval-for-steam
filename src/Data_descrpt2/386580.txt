							This is part of our support package plan for Crest where you can help us in our Early Access effort, and getting something nice in return. This is a high quality PDF book compiled and written by the art director of the game, showing you the process of the first two years, 2013 - 2015. Will be updated after the full launch of the game.


To access the art book after purchase go to the same folder where you can find Crest (Game Library>Properties>Browse Local Files...).
