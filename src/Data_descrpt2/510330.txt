							Introduction
Shotgun Raiders is a 2d fast action platform shooter. 
Inspired by the easy controls of classic mario, limited gun angles of the good old arcade shooters, and level crafting. 
This is a bloody 4 player local party game with file access to import your own characters, share created backgrounds & levels. 

Features
Trading Cards!
Premade levels. 
You can choose (original levels or player created levels) 
2-4 player battles or play against ai on easy medium or hard. 
You can create your own levels, even the 2 layers of parallaxing background! 
Also you can import your custom made characters! 

Gameplay
You can walljump, wallclimb with a pickaxe, and doublejump to quickly move around. 
Shotgun ammo & grenades are infinite, battles are quickly won by those who master the easy controls. 
Grenades can be cooked (hold button = grenade timer). 
If you have kills and you do a grenade suicide, a kill is substracted in the form of a large golden jewel. 
This jewel is thrown into the level and can be taken by any player giving them the kill you worked for! 
So cook those grenades :-) 
The gametypes are deathmatch and last man standing.

Controls
Requires a gamepad or a arcade/fightstick to play

Extra info
I have made this game so, that you can easy access your game files. 
This makes it possible for you to pack your levels/backgrounds/characters into a zip and send it to friends any way you like.
