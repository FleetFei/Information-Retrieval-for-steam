							All content included is royalty-freeThe acoustic guitar has been an essential element in almost every genre of modern music.  From fingerpicking folk, to indie rock strumming, to mellow country chords, the acoustic guitar is the backbone of countless songs, yet something that has been overlooked in loop libraries.... until now. With The Doug Wamble (Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux, Cassandra Wilson) Acoustic Guitar collection we've captured performances in all of these styles in pristine, 24 bit 48 kHz detail and converted them into REX2, AIFF, WAV and Stylus RMX formats, so you can easily infuse your own tracks with acoustic goodness in any DAW.Sessions Include: 80_E_WestCoastMellow100_A_CashCountry100_Bm_GypsyQueen120_C_HappyPop120_D_CountryGospel160_G_ThreeFourPop120_E_IndiePop200_G_FingerPickFolk
