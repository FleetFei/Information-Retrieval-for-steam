							The Sixth CavalierOne on One Adventures #4Welcome to 1 on 1 Adventures, action-packed scenarios designed for 1 player and 1 GM.This module is converted from 32 adventure-packed pages, complete with detailed maps and descriptions, forming a ready-made adventure for the smallest gaming group. Although it is designed for a Bard or Rogue level 9-11, with some minor scaling, Sixth Cavalier is suitable for use with a traditional four-player party.Hubrimort is a small, respectable town whose only claim to fame is a local governmental position bestowed by five of the king's chosen officials, known as the Cavaliers. The position is given to the head of one of four noble families once each decade. While competition for the mysterious position is always fierce, this year there are rumors of underhanded deals with criminals, rigged tournaments, and a nasty case of blackmail. Which of the ancient families deserves ten years of power and privilege? Only the Sixth Cavalier can help the five officials make the right choice!If you enjoy this module, look for future releases in the 1 on 1 Adventures line from Expeditious Retreat Press.Author: Patrick WeekesFantasy Grounds Conversion: Doug DavisonRequirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Full or Ultimate license of Fantasy Grounds and the included 3.5E (or compatible) ruleset.
