							To help "pull things together," the brilliant doctor Frank N. Stein carefully fashioned Chuck D. Head from the leftover parts of some other people that we don’t talk about.
					  Somehow he couldn’t quite get the head right – how many heads do people need again? Head bone connects to the... what bone? Well, to cut a long story short, there’s this island which is made up of body parts (like they are sometimes), and the fearsome villain Max D. Cap has separated all the parts to gain total control. It’s now up to Chuck D. Head to go over there, and sort it all out.
