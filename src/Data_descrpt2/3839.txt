							Okay, remember how a little while ago I was saying, "The soundtrack to Psychonauts is so good, you just have to buy it!" Well, this is a little awkward to say, but I had the wrong soundtrack. This is the one I meant. Not the other one. I mean, that one is fine, but THIS one is the really good one. You should buy this one. It has the music from the cutscenes of Psychonauts, without all of those annoying words or sound effects. They've been remixed and re-mastered by Maestro McConnell for your enjoyment. Don't tell the other soundtrack, but this soundtrack's my favorite. - Tim
