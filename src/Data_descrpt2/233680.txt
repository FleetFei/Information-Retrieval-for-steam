Black Ink is in early access
..................................................................................................................................................................................................Why Early Access?"In order to achieve this we chose to put Black Ink in the hands of the users as soon as possible to gather feedback, adapt our development to their needs and also help us finance the project while staying independent."Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?"Black Ink will stay in early access as long as we feel something too important is missing. This is an iterative development and no fixed date is set but we hope we can call it complete within the next two years."How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?"Every feature in the full version will appear during the Early Access process as we develop them.We are planning on adding more options to brush creation and even a way to mix them together, more drawing tools like symmetry and cloning, better management of layer number, more customization options like custom keyboard shortcuts, new presentation for some UI elements and other improvements asked by the community. We also aim at releasing on OSX.You can see a detailed list of planned developments here"What is the current state of the Early Access version?"Black Ink is fully functional and each update is tested and stable. The ongoing development is all about adding features. A lot of people are already enjoying drawing with Black Ink (here) and are giving us feedback on what to add next to make it better."Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?"Black Ink’s price will raise as it becomes more complete and attain a full version value once it leaves early access.We will announce major price-changing updates in advance so everyone can get a chance to get it cheaper."How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?We closely monitor our community activity for feedback, bug reports, feature suggestions and of course drawings! That’s how we keep Black Ink stable and usable.Each feature development is evaluated according to what our users are asking and we are of course happy to publish the best drawings on our network.We also have an ‘Alpha’ program that users can sign up to. This version is a work in progress of the next release, it contains the features we are working on and testers can help us make them as complete as possible and stabilize the release.
