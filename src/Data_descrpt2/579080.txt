							Snow Games VR is a single-player Virtual Reality snowball fight in a winter wonderland. Make and throw virtual snowballs to hit targets, while under attack from the ever moving enemy snowmen. Snow Games VR features two exciting modes, Score Attack and Arcade Mode. 

See how many points you can score against the clock in 60 seconds in Score Attack. Block snowballs to avoid losing points. 

In Arcade Mode, every snowball that hits you edges you closer to the end of the game. Survive for as long as you can to reach the highest score you can get.
