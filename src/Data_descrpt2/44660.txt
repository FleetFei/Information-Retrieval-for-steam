							Many believe racing reached it's pinnacle back when big sideburns and reflective sunglasses were as important to any driver as his crash-helmet, so with this DLC pack we put this to the test with a collection of cars that will hit home with anyone who likes their racing cars loud and charismatic.						From the unmistakable rounded curves of the Volvo Amazon, over the iconic BMW 2002 to the raw coolness factor of the â€™70 Chevrolet Camaro, it is all here. Raw, authentic and true to the roots of motorsports.						The Retro pack contains the first hillclimb stage ever made by SimBin and it gives a world premiere to the Poznan track, never seen before in any authentic racing title.
