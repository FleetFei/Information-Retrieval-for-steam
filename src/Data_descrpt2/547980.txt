Story: 

You're a kid. Who's gray. With rabbit ears. 

People have been grumbling about the goings-on below town. Seems there's some sort of magic lantern that's throwing the whole joint into chaos. Yeah, that's what I said too! Full of it, they gotta' be, right? Turns out- not so much.. 

So.. What's it you do again, kid? Warrior? Thief? Wizard? 
OH! A lawyer!? 

Hahaha, well you sure had me fooled there for a while.. little jerk.. 

Here's what you're gonna' do: Head below town, JUST FOR ME, and see what the hell that Lantern's on about. They tell me it turns all kinds of colors, and each color changes the rules. 

How so!? What am I, an electrician?!? 
That's up to you to find out! 

And so you did!

Equin: The Lantern is my fun little roguelike with some wholly original ideas. Conquer the 50 floor dungeon and its evil inhabitants in a quest to the bottom of the joint to find the mysterious lantern itself. With features like a turn-based 1st person battle system, Auto Killing weaker enemies, an XP Hit Streak bonus, hundreds of weapons and armor to find, diabolical floor events to shake things up, a lantern who screws with the rules, and oh yeah- PERMADEATH BABY, this is the game for those who like a good challenge. 

STRATEGERIZE by slamming doors in your enemy's face to lock them in a room, or lead them into a web and trap their stank @sses. Watch out for stronger champ versions though and much stronger bosses at every turn! 

NOTE: This time around I got some help from the fantasic Rocco W and his sick 8-bit tunes! They were so good I decided to scrap all my own music except for the title theme.
