							Smash Pixel Racing is a 2-4 player local multiplayer game about spaceship racing and smashing your friends into asteroids. Compete against friends in no-rules brutal spaceship racing and combat, or play cooperatively and see how long you can survive together.

Split second decisions and lightning reflexes will ensure your survival on the race to the finish line. No re-spawning, it's last man standing in space, survival of the fittest. If you make it to the finish line, you've earned it. Drift and dodge around space junk, take out enemies, collect energy, and pick your moment to boost, shoot or smash your way to victory!

Choose your spaceship and take it to victory! Ships are balanced but split into weight classes with different stats, find a ship that meets your play style!

Throughout Early Access we will be refining the game, adding lots of awesome content, new features & mechanics, many new ships to race, different enemies and obstacles, new game-modes and more so stay tuned!
