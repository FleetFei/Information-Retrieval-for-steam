							The spectacular soundtrack to Heckabomb, the hit twin-stick shooter from Allicorn Games.

Your world is dead - annihilated by the alien armada. But you - the prototype AI pilot of the Heckabomber survived. Now a vengeful doomsday weapon, you must seek out every world belonging to the enemy and blow it up.

With a pounding EDM foundation and orchestral flourish, the Heckabomb score soars along side classic heroic-arcade sounds of the past. Energetic, dramatic, gripping - it complements the explosive gameplay perfectly.
