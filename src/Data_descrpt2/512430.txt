Make America Great Again, is a different kind of game, a 2D indie game, that mixes pixel art with digital painting. At first, the user finds the commands odd, but then the game becomes surprisingly entertaining and exciting, being hit you lose and must restart the level. The fearless leader will face the Islamic State (ISIS) in different regions, and the tests of his mission increase as the game progresses. However, President counts with an infinite amount of ammo that he took from front lines of the war. 

One sure thing. You will either love or hate this game! 

It takes a particular skill player to defeat ISIS.
