You'll have to reproduce real moves from sport activities like archery or martial arts. As you'll have to move your body a lot, especially your arms, make sure that you have a clear play space (minimum 2m x 1.5m). Stay far enough from your screen and your friends. It would be sad to hurt anyone :).And like in a real physical activity: don't forget to breath and take a break! (and drink gallons of water dammit!)
