							** This DLC does not add any map building content to Virutal Battlamap **Virtual Battlemap Commercial License allows the purchaser royalty free commercial usage of maps and images exported from within Virtual Battlemap.This license is designed to suit the needs of professional or independent publishers who are looking to include battle map images, attract images, story images and promotional images within their gaming modules. Selling modules for pen and paper or online use will become a much easier feat with high quality illustrations and battle maps.We have had many module developers ask us about using Virtual Battlemap for commercial products and this is the answer to that request. With this DLC you can receive monetary gain from the sale of the maps and images made in Virtual Battlemap. Without this license you are only allowed to use Virtual Battlemap for your own personal use and may not trade battle maps or images exported from Virtual Battlemap for any kind of gain, whether it's monetary or in trade.Other professional uses for Virtual Battlemap: Collectible Card Game Card Art Board Game Art Token Art Game creation software 2D art assets (Backgrounds, Monsters, Items) Whatever you Like ;)Future Plans to make this license even more valuable: DLC containing monsters to help with creating great attract images, story images and promotional images. DLC containing Heroes to help with creating great attract images, story images and promotional images. DLC containing Weapons and items to help with creating great attract images, story images and promotional images.
