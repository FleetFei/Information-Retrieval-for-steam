							Everyone's favourite hamsternaut is back! Escape the cage, avoid spiders, collect nibbles and rocket to the moon!

Help Mr. Nibbles break out of his cage-prison and roam across the dangerous spider-infested backyard landscape before hopping in his handy rocket ship and blasting into space. Each stage contains unique graphics, backgrounds and sounds. 

Collect as many nibbles as you can during your adventure to spend on the mighty wheel in hopes of winning spiffy new outfits. Each outfit is lovingly handcrafted by our hamster tailors, each comes with unique sounds and effects. Who knew collecting could be so much fun!

You must guide our furry hero on his epic quest to become the first hamster in space. Collect nibbles, avoid spiders and complete the challenges. Controls so simple even a 3-year old can master them in seconds (trust me on this).
