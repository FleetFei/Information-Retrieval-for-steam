							GET THE GEMS is an action/puzzle game in the oldschool-style of Boulder Dash and Emerald Mine.

You are Fluffy, a poor little slimeball, who is trapped inside an abandoned mine deep under the surface of Earth. The ultimate goal is to fight your way through thirty challenging caves back to the surface. To solve a cave, you have to eat a certain number of gems in a limited time to unlock the exit leading to the next cave. But beware, for many obstacles will give you a hard time, such as boulders and walls blocking your way, sneaky vermin, exploding nitro balls, a mysterious bubbling mass and more...
GET READY AND ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE!

An absolute MUST for every Boulder Dash and Emerald Mine fan !!
