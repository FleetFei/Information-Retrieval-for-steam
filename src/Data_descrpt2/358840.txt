Then we have co-op mode where up to 4 players can tackle the enemies as one team. And no we don’t leave anyone behind. Then there’s also the competitive mode that allows also up to 4 players to compete in split screen. Competitive mode is like a race to the finish. The one who’s first wins. Is it all already. No it’s not. I left my favorite to last. It’s the battle mode. This is straight up shoot everything that moves game mode. You go head to head with other players and only one can come out of the game as the winner. There are no limits in battle mode, everything is allowed, we actually encourage some elbow action when it seems that you might be losing.
