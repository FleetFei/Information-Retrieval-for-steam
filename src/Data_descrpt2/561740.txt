							Kill your enemies, possess their bodies, and take their abilities as your own in this turn-based procedurally generated death labyrinth. You play as the imp, the weakest monster in the dungeon. Tired of being bullied by the other monsters, you set off with your sidekick Mid to descend to the deepest levels of the dungeon, defeat the final boss, and take his place.MidBoss is easy to pick up and play if you're new to the genre of traditional roguelikes (turn-based strategic RPGs with permadeath), but still has the depth and complexity that veterans expect and enjoy. Features Possess your enemy and gain their strengths and skills with over 50 unique abilities to discover and learn. Permanent death, if you die your save is gone! Randomized potions every game. Who knows what's in these mystery bottles! (optional) Traps as well as unidentified and cursed items. Dynamic music system that ups the musical excitement when enemies are about.
