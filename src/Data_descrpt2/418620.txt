							The TakeOver is at heart and old school beat 'em up inspired by games like Final Fight and Streets of Rage.  Although the gameplay is based on these classic games it offers an extended combo system, fast gameplay and modern visuals. Using a combination of full 3D backgrounds and high definition pre rendered sprites the game is designed with Full HD in mind.
