Beat the clock and squash the alien scum in this frenetic VR shooter.The year is 2027.

The United Nations has hired the firm to secure the planet Earth, and rid it of alien infestation. The fate of the world is in your hands and your headset. Good luck.The core design of VR Apocalypse revolves around the following major tenets.Comfort = Immersion. First-person shooters are not normally a good idea for VR due to presence-breaking VR-sickness. However, we think we’ve conquered it with this title by utilizing a new technique we’ve dubbed a “dynamic rest frame”. Classic first-person shooting/traversal has never felt this good in a VR headset.Replay Value is king. Forget short, one-off experiences. VR Apocalypse is a highly replayable, arcade style shooter with randomized elements that will keep players coming back for more.Arcade Leaderboards. Compete against friends to see who can get the best possible times on our customized leaderboards.Exploding Aliens. Because who doesn't like watching aliens go boom?
