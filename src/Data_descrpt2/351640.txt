
							About This Game
							I believe that gaming should not be anything complicated or diffcult, 
but a relaxing and pleasure experience. 

Therefore, I designed this ARPG 

battle system which requires no attack button to play. 
The simplicity brings a fluent and interesting gaming experience. 

Eternal Senia is the realization of this concept. 

I spent one year developing this game. 
It is a game that can be easily enjoyed by any player. 


‚óèCharacters: 
Heroine Senia has both her name and the outlook from "Ygnizem Seniar" 
in Ragnarok Online. 

Senia's sister, Magaleta, also originates from a foe "Magaleta" in 
lighthalzen dungeon of Ragnarok Online. 

Ragnarok Online is, to this day, still my favorite game of all time. 
EtneralSenia is a non-profit making game solely based on my enthusiasm for RO and gaming developing. 
I wish Eternal Senia can bring up the memory of classic 
MMORPG Ragnarok Online to all players who participated.
