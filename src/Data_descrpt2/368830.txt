As time passed, younger kings desired to gain absolute power of the land and waged countless wars with each other. The gods were displeased with the reckless actions and greed each kingdom took part in, so they took back the relics, hid them in a large tower, and proclaimed: "Whomever is able to pass the challenges of this tower will become the ruler of all known land."
