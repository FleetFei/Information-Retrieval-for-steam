							Late one night while listening to the music of the stars, a dozing Dr. Dee picked up an unusual transmission from a distant world. Decoding the signal he discovered it was a distress call from a planet called Octamari. The planet was about to be engulfed by a supernova and this message was their last hope. Included in the distress call were detailed instructions for a machine that would blast the Octamari escape pods through the heart of the supernova, twisting space and time and lord knows what else before arriving safely at their destination. There was only one thing to do. Build the machine and save the Octamari home world!Key Features Fast passed match-3 actionCute, quick-fix funHigh score chaser gameplayIntegrated Steam Leader boardsStudio Message/CreatorsNic CusworthChris RavenscroftNeil FieldingDave BlewettPete Harrap
