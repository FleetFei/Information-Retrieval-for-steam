							In a twisted medieval dimension, undead creatures and bestial horrors have done the unthinkable--callously slaughtering your entire race. Your friends. Your family. Eliminated. But the nightmare has just begun. Wielding ungodly weapons such as the Firemace and Hellstaff and casting spells from the Tomes of Power, you must seek your vengeance. Or die trying.
					
					Supports up to four players via network, two by modem. Adventure through the game with a friend or crack their skull in a bloody deathmatch.
					Walk. Run. Fly. Look all around you, even up and down.
					Choose from among 7 weapons (from the simple staff to the awesome Phoenix Rod).
					Use arcane artifacts to unleash unearthly power on unsuspecting foes.
