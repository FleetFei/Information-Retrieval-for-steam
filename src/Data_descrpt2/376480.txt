							The Blinding Light Dissipates; You Are Manifest. The people's cries have activated ancient Ohr deposits and woken you from your slumber.They used to sing songs about you, the angels, the stars the watchers; then one day you all disappeared.But now you are back and must help them to find their frequencies, their souls, your heaven ....  The mother of all Rail slave games, all the genres, all the esoteric-ism, all the fever dreaming Unique and bizarre "karma cow" micro management  "Tang soo do" your way through specially cordoned off battle hot zones; utilize round house kicks, spinning 360 hook kicks, ki energy attack and  it's upgrades, diamond dredge and plas-palm. Heavily inspired by NES turtles, Simons quest, The adventure of Link and Dizzy ....all the games your mother warned you about.  Tricky to master but rewarding wind up animation based attacks, precision jumping, over world and side scrolling action, shops. OST of Evocative Piano reflections punctuated by F.Tylers menacing, grinding noise core.
