In Gafolweed, a village on the borderlands, autumn brought the first chills and a sense of deep concern. The harvest has been meager, and they say that Zafron, a cruel boy who trafficked in witchcraft, has returned from exile to poison the land and unleash a monster on his former fellow citizens. This creature has already slain three young men, the last of which, Halmil, has just been found dead in the forest. As fear makes its way in the hearts of the villagers, a old tale passes from mouth to mouth, a tale that sinks its roots not in the recent history of Gafolweed, but many, many decades beforeâ€¦Will your fellowship of budding heroes be able to defy the Fangs from the Past?
