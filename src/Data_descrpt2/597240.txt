							This is johns.game, a small RTS set out to do big things. Your goal is to conquer the entirety of Naben, keep your people from starving, and find the long-forgotten secrets of the world. The game is moderately complicated and involves a lot of thought. There are real world aspects (for example, lighting a fire using fire, breaking a snowman gives you snow, etc.) for a slightly more realistic tone. This game is pretty community driven in the sense that if you want something you just ask. Some features that have batteries included:SnowmenThe DevilWaring FactionsFarmingWolvesMr. RobotoCows and Various other animals that can potentially turn evil and oh God I'm bragging again aren't I?Secret Places.....Extra info from here downIf you find a bug or have something you think would be a good fit, please feel free to message or comment.
