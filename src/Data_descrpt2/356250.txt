							Gathering Sky is a playful, beautiful experience about a flock of birds on a journey across the sky. It starts with a single bird. Use your mouse to steer and grow your flock or let your birds find their own way. Dance in the winds of a far-away world and create an emotional story without words.The world is brought to life by an original score by Dren McDonald performed by the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.Gathering Sky is enjoyable with any skill level and can be finished in under an hour. Fly with us.http://gathering-sky.com
