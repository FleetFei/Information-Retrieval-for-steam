							Gear up for the fight with a new exclusive costume for Luffy: a stunning golden gladiator armor!

To register for the Donquixote Pirate's tournament at Corrida Colosseum in Dressrosa, Luffy famously disguised himself as "Lucy". This golden costume skin for Luffy plays off that motif, adding some extra armor elements as well as a Fourth Gear transformation exclusive to One Piece Burning Blood.
