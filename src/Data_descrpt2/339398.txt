							NOTE: THE MAIN GAME X-PLANE 10 IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE! PLEASE ONLY PURCHASE DLCS WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY OWNER OF X-PLANE 10!The regional airport Pullman-Moscow is located in the north-west of the US in the state of Washington. This add-on recreates it entirely including its environment. The aerial image covers a surface of 59km² with a resolution of 0.3m/pixel. Due to appropriate adjustments, the scenery fits nicely into the default terrain of X-Plane, but also into HD Mesh and G2XPL. The airport itself features photo realistic building textures and static aircraft as well as static and animated vehicles. 3D grass, hundreds of hand-placed trees and distinctive buildings of the nearby city of Pullman make the scenery feel alive.Besides a regular scheduled flight by Horizon Air (Alaska Airlines) that connects Pullman-Moscow to Seattle, the airport is of special importance for the two universities “Washington State University” and “University of Idaho” that use it for charter flights for their sports team’s away games.FeaturesComplete airport and surroundingsAerial image with 59km² coverage and a resolution of .3m per pixelPhoto real building texturesVery good adaption to the default mesh and HD Mesh and to G2XPLThe city of Pullman contains all distinctive objects (University, Beasley Coliseum, Indoor Practice Facility, Martin Stadium, Summer Hill Rentals and many more)3D grass (optional)Hundreds of hand-placed treesStatic aircraftStatic and animated vehiclesManual in English and German
