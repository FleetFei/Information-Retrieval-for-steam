Wreak havoc while flexibly adapting to the 5+ types of ever-changing battlegrounds. Position your robots, capture important points, exploit high ground, protect the fortress, make sure the key robot survives, and so on... Tweak and customize your robots using chips. Collect chips of different shapes, and arrange them in the best way possible to maximize your robot's abilities. Expand your robot army by destroying the enemy's robots, and win parts to craft new robots with. Each robot is the result of a different recipe, and what parts you will actually get is a matter of pure luck. Compete against other players in online battles and climb the leaderboards. Expand your army, mostly through sheer force, but also via diplomacy and the accumulation of riches.

Good luck on your mission!
