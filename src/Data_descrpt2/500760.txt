
							About This Game
							How quickly and cleanly can you break the blocks?
That is the goal -- and thrill -- of this game!

Kuraburo kai is not your average block-breaker game.

Here you use Shuriken instead of the standard balls, and you are given certain freedom in where you want to throw them. You can also launch a multi-ball trigger when you wish.

This makes the game very different from the standard block-breaker, and you can play in a stress-free way to your heart's content.

Shuriken have a power level -- once the power fills up, you can launch piercing attacks that rip right through the blocks without bouncing back.
Using this power and the right timing, you can pierce through blocks and enjoy seeing the walls crumble before you.


Select from one of five playable characters!
Each character has a unique Ninjyutu (ninja art) that can be used to further bust the blocks.


Once you get the handle of the controls, you'll enjoy the brisk feeling of breaking through blocks with reckless abandon.
