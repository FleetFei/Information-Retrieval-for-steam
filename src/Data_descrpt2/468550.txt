							This is the original soundtrack for Kenshi, including two short "making of" videos.Track list:KenshiScorching WindsSands at DuskFertileThe WildgrassAs it isYearn for NightBreath of the WorldBogDescendPitAshen AirApprox 50 minutes of music totalNOTES ABOUT THE SOUNDTRACKThe music system in Kenshi has been designed in such a way, that asyou play through the game the engine randomly selects from a handfulof different musical elements to create new compositional excerpts. Itis this ambient approach and "non-player interactivity" of the musicthat reinforces Kenshi's indifferent tone. Obviously for a traditionalSoundtrack release we can not recreate the randomization of this musicsystem (yet). However, we can get close and musically sculpt eachtrack with wide brushstrokes to capture the same feeling.In addition to the gameplay music, the Kenshi Original Soundtrackfeatures the Main Title and a few other traditional recordings thatcan be heard throughout the game. Put on a good set of headphones andlet the music transport you to the windy dunes, overgrown swamps, andunexplored wilderness of Kenshi. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
