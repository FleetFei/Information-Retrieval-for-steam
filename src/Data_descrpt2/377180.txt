							Totes, the portable pet bank, can hold up to 72 slots worth of treasure making it easy to collect and store items! This is an account-wide item that will unlock a 72-slot pet bank for all characters on your account. Remember, thoughâ€”for pets to be strong enough to lug your stuff around, you have to keep them fed! This pet comes with a stack of three pet foods to get you started. Additional pet food can be purchased from merchants in-game.
