
							About This Game
							Defend your ranch from a horde of evil boars hellbent on stealing your livestock and eating your family.

All that stands between you and the horrific vision of ravenous beasts devouring your loved ones is your many acres of loyal mutant plants.  With each boar these bloodthirsty botanical abominations dispatch, you'll earn money to buy more seeds.  Leave your misgivings about GMO crops by the roadside, as you can't afford not to buy the most scientifically twisted weaponized legumes that the Monsanta corporation has to offer.    

Battle Ranch takes inspiration from such hits as Plants vs Zombies, Leave Devil Alone, Pets War, Ranch Rush, Harvest Moon, and more.
