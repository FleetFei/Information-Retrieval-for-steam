							These are humanity’s Final Days… Dirty warfare has left most of the population mutated and thirsty for blood. Band together and battle for your survival!Final Days is a fast-paced and intense multi-player shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world. It attempts to blend retro arcade style with modern elements. The design goal is for the game to be quick and simple to play while providing an enjoyable challenge. Inspirations include titles such as Smash TV, Gauntlet, Killing Floor, and Left 4 Dead.Can you survive?Current FeaturesEnjoy intense multi-player sessions with as many friends as you can muster (up to 16 players!)Play split-screen with up to 4 friends on the same computer (and still be able to join online/LAN games!)Control the action using a twin-stick controller, Steam controller, or keyboard & mouseFeel the tension as the realistic field of view forces you to check your surroundingsLocate threats using your “acoustic radar” which visualises where sounds are coming fromTest your skill with a unique aiming mechanism which varies accuracy (e.g. running will reduce your accuracy)Think on your feet as the hordes (and sometimes other players) destroy the environmentDestroy the mutant hordes with several different ammo types and explosivesUse your shove attack to help get you out of those tight situationsEnjoy awesome tunes by The Groove FoundryChoose from 10 different maps to battle in (with more to come)Planned Features** These are features I'm planning to add, or are currently being developed.Please be aware that this list will be likely to change over time based on community feedback.Game mode better suited for single playerFurther expansion of maps and game modesAbility to create and share your own custom mapsProcedurally generated levelsMore enemy types, including bossesMore ammo types and explosivesMore musicSteam Trading Cards, Achievements, Leaderboards, and Workshop supportPlayer customisationCustomisable controls
