							Ian has a decision to make: stay home and stay a virgin or drive 800 miles to lose it with an online hottie. Decision made. Now Ian (Josh Zuckerman) and his horndog buddy Lance (Clark Duke) are off on a sex safari... with "BFF" baggage Felicia (Amanda Crew) in tow. Their epic quest features a stolen GTO, kinky trailer park sex, a prison fight, topless Abstinence Xtreme dancers, a smartass Amish super-mechanic (Seth Green) and his drunken, boob-flashing friends, a gun-wielding Mexican donut and Ian's "d-bag" brother (James Marsden) in hot pursuit.
