							Spoiler Alert is a video game that tests your platforming skills… in reverse. It’s a comedy platformer that you play backwards.When you pick this game up, it has already been beaten. The big bad boss is defeated, the coins are collected and the princess has been rescued. Why, oh why?Unraveling this mystery takes you through the entire game, from the last level to the first. You must uncollect the coins, revive the enemies and avoid nasty time paradoxes. In other words, you must uncomplete the game by playing it backwards.Everything in this game is so familiar, yet so different and new. You have played it a thousand times before, and at the same time, you have never tried anything like it.100 Levels in 4 worldsSpeedRuner ModeStart playing at the end and make your way backClassic platformer gameplay mashed with simple controlsBeautiful handdrawn graphicsOriginal soundtrack by Roland La GoyEpic boss fights, upgrades and many different and unique enemiesThe Steam-exclusive Collector's Edition version includesLevel editor with Steam WorkshopThe original soundtrack, including a new bonus track and deleted tracksThe original Game Jam version of Spoiler Alert - see how it all beganExclusive hi-res desktop art and concept artScreensavers, deleted graphics, and more!
