							Note: This is not To the Moon's sequel, but rather a small experimental project.---------------------------------------------------------------------------From the creator of To the Moon: A simple, wordless 1-hour short about a boy who found an injured bird, told through a blur between reality and imagination.A Bird Story is an interactive pixel animation with the sole purpose of telling a simple story. It is a standalone narrative, with its own beginning and ending. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------A word of caution from the devs: This is a rather polarizing game, particularly for fans of To the Moon. As a guarantee with all games from Freebird, there is a 100% personal (confidential) refund policy with no questions asked; even if it just isn't your cup of tea.
