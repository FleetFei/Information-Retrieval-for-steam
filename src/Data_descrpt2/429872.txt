							We thought we had seen everything the Hive had to offer. From Corpse Eaters to Panic Spiders to Bile Slugs, we figured it couldn’t get much worse... We were wrong.With each day new terrors spill out from the Hive: Flesh Tick Swarms, Living Nests, Gore Maulers... Just a few of the new “species” we’ve encountered. We don’t know what’s caused it, or just how many there are, but one thing is for certain: the Hive is evolving, and it might spell doom for us all.This XenoShyft expansion includes 5 new types of Hive enemies per wave and 1 new boss card for each wave!Note you only need this expansion if you want to create games with the new enemies. You can join games that have this expansion without owning it.
