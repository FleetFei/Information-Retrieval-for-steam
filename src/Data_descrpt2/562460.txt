							Ra² is a physics based skill game with puzzle elements, inspired by the smallest elementary particles of our universe.The core of the game is to navigate a ball through the different levels, controlling and influencing it by two tractor beams.Just as in quantum physics, the game mechanics are limited to a few basic laws and objects that have been combined meticulously.The polarization change, one of the main mechanics in the game, is simple but challenging. Through contact with a specific object, the gravitation is reversed, the interface turns yellow and the tractor beams push the ball away, instead of attracting it.Features:• 130 Level• Zooming, scrolling and rotating level sections• Leaderboards for each level• Speedrun mode• Original soundtrack with 13 tracks
