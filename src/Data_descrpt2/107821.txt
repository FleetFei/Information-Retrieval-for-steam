							The new content includes four new, incredibly challenging puzzle levels: 'Container Chaos', 'Shaft Shuffle', 'Brainyard' and 'Assembly Line'. These levels were created as a response to fans that found the original stages a bit too easy. The ‘Hard Times’ content is designed to use all of the existing game mechanics, with an emphasis on puzzle-solving as opposed to combat, and offers a difficult test for even the most experienced players.
