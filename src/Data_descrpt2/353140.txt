All members of the PA-28 family are all-metal, unpressurized, single-engined, piston-powered airplanes with low-mounted wings and tricycle landing gear. They all have a single door on the copilot side, which is entered by stepping on the wing.The Piper PA28 Cherokee 180F from Carenado includes a highly detailed interior and exterior model, full moving and animated rudder and flaps, light effects and also a brilliant interactive virtual cockpit.
