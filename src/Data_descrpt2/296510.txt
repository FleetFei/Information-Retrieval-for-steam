							Magnetic By Nature explores platforming without platforms. Experience a fast-paced, single-player adventure mixing fluid motion, split-second decision making, stylized machine-age visuals, and a dynamic soundscape. As the last remaining robot, journey through the forgotten ruins to reactivate your friends.  Successfully funded on Kickstarter and winner of both the Best Developed Game and Audience Choice awards at the 2013 Utah Game Wars competition, MBN is the debut title from Team Tripleslash.
