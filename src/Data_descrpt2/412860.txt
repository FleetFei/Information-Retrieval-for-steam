							Battle Zombies, save your co-workers and earn that promotion you’ve always wanted in this hilarious new Zombie RPG with a difference.

Zombie Office Politics is an old-school three-quarter-view RPG set in an office where the staff are mysteriously turning into zombies. Forget an easy first day watching Health and Safety videos and getting your picture taken for your I.D. badge. You’re off on an epic journey through unexplored reaches of the office. Your quest - to halt the Zombie outbreak.

Battle Zombies using improvised everyday items found in the office, paper balls, dvds, paper clips and many more. Stock up on essential supplies such as coffee and donuts at vending machines, or even recycle your unwanted items into cool new stuff.

Zombie Office Politics blends humour, story and action with traditional RPG elements to provide a unique gaming experience.

Are you ready to save your work colleagues (even the ones that went back for their coats) and become a hero on your first day on the job?
