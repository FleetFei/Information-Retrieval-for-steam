							ROM: Extraction is a fast-paced homage to the classic arcade shooter, featuring an unprecedented style of VR gameplay.Welcome to the year 2076, where you now have the power to slow down time--called "Reflex" power. You'll play as a member of an Orb Extraction Unit, on your way to extract highly volatile energy matter--Orbs--from chambers on the moon. With only a few minutes to defend yourself against the onslaught of alien-built robots protecting the chambers, discover the immense satisfaction of decimating those ‘bots via your "Throw, Slow & Shoot" combat strategy. As of Feb 28th 2017, ROM has been updated with a new expansion, entitled “Overrun.”Overrun is a whole new level for players to master, featuring several unique twists on VR gameplay.
