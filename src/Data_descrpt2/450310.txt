							On New Year's Eve in 1955, Richard Howell, a patient at the Hillcrest Sanatorium, went on a bloody rampage, killing three children before he hanged himself. Fifty-six years later, a team of ghost hunters — from the popular TV series "Ghost Trackers" — prepares to spend the night at the sanatorium. They hope to capture paranormal activity for the entertainment of their show's fans. Instead, they unleash a horrifying force of evil…hell-bent on their destruction.
