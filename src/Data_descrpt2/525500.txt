Once upon a time in a magical Candy kingdom, there was a king named King Candy and he had so many candies that his whole kingdom was enjoying them every day! On a glorious day, his army of candy cookies opened the door for a cute little fairy, who was lost and desperate to find a new place that she could call home. After hearing all the stories that the fairy was sharing with him, he felt that he needed to help her out. Without further thinking he offered the fairy to stay in his kingdom as long as she wanted and enjoy his candies.At this point, he didn’t knew that the cute little fairy was actually a witch in disguise, wanting to take all his candy and his kingdom. The king was so interested in the fairy, that he invited her daily to his castle, to hear all the stories, which the fairy could tell him. He didn’t know that spending time with the fairy caused him to fall into the grip of the witch, who was secretly putting a spell on him. Days and days passed and step by step the king lost his interest in the candies and his kingdom. He couldn’t and wouldn’t care any more. Once the kings mind was completely in control of the fairy, the witch could finally show her true form. He wouldn’t see or wouldn’t care…Under the control of the witch, he did everything for her.King Candy commanded his army of cookies to destroy anyone who would enter his kingdom from then on.She even commanded him to switch all the nice candy with enchanted candies, so people who would eat them would be instantly under the control of the witch…His kingdom is lost.
