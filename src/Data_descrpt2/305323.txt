							All content included is royalty-freeThe Loop Loft teamed up again with Celso Alberti (Steve Winwood, Airto, Flora Purim, Herbie Mann) to produce Volume 2 of the massively popular Brazilian Drums and Percussion series, resulting in the most in-depth collection of Brazilian grooves ever recorded.  Expanding on both loops, instruments and sounds, Volume 2 explores highly authentic rhythms and feels from all over Brazil including candomblé, maculelê, maracatu, quadrilha and many others.In addition to the hundreds of loops included in Volume 2, The Loop Loft sampled Celso's vast collection of Brazilian percussion instruments in stunning 24-bit clarity.  From agogo bells, to surdo drums, to caxixi shakers, to pandeiros, the sound of Brazil is now at your fingertips (and in your sampler).  And with loops available in WAV, REX2, AIFF (Apple Loops), Stylus RMX and Reason ReFill formats, you can easily use Celso Alberti's Brazilian Drums with any DAW on the market!
