							Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime Challenge Pack brings hours of a new single player experience to this ghost-hunting adventure. With all-new two game modes, Lonely Hero and Arcade Challenge, you won't put the controller down! In Lonely Hero mode, players can select any level they have unlocked and start from there but this time you are on your own - no co-op, no friendly teammates- just one player to combat the waves of the paranormally possessed.  Designed for seasoned gamers, Arcade Challenge gives players a limited number of lives to see how their skills measure up on a distinct Global Leaderboard.
