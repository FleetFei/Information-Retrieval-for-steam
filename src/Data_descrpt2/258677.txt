							The mixed-traffic Class 35 diesel-hydraulic locomotive is now available for Train Simulator in BR green livery.The hydraulic transmission fitted to the Class 35 locomotives gave them their affectionate nickname of ‘Hymeks’ and, at the time they were built, were the most powerful diesel-hydraulic locomotive operating with a single engine. They were popular sights at the head of semi-fast and freight trains across the Western Region of the British rail network during the 1960s.A total of 101 models were produced by Beyer Peacock between 1961 and 1964, although their operational life was relatively short – withdrawals began in 1971 and were completed by 1975.
