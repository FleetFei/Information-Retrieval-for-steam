
							About This Game
							The space pirates are terrorizing our neighboring planets and their next target is Earth.

Your mission is to take down these invaders and prevent them from reaching our home planet.
After completing a objetive you will receive a new objetive coming from the EFS with the purpose to
defend our home planet.

You can play this game as a lone solider, or team up with a friend and enjoy double the destruction.

As you travel through space you must collect energy, this will boost your ship's constantly draining power.
The enemies will also drop money, which can be used to purchase powerful upgrades. 

Increase your armor, firepower, and level up your craft.
