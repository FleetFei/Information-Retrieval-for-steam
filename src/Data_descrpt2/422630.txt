							The Metaverse Construction Kit is a virtual environment to construct your own 3D creations. Build anything you can think of using the twenty-four structural elements, and the soon to be released mechanical and technical elements. Make your creations in any style with sixty-four material types like organics, metals, minerals, and composites. And when you're done, publish them to the workshop for others to build upon or from, and for players in the parent Metaverse universe to incorporate into their planetary settlements.
