							Directed by: Jon LindstromWritten by: Jeff Barry, McCaleb Burnett, Jon LindstromStarring: Jon Lindstrom, Jeff Barry, McCaleb Burnett, Cassandra Freeman, Mikal Evans, Jacob Knoll, Brianne Moncrief, Luke Robertson, Richard Bekins, Samantha Soule, Antoinette DipietropoloInspired by the crime dramas of the 1960s and ’70s, “How We Got Away with It” is a taut, suspenseful noir. Returning home from jail just before the arrival of a group of his friends for their annual reunion weekend, Henry (McCaleb Burnett) discovers a shocking tragedy, and his rash and unpredictable response sets in motion a chain of explosive events. The secrets uncovered lead to revenge and murder, and what’s intended as a celebratory gathering instead becomes a life-changing event, sweeping up the innocent and threatening to destroy everyone involved. Co-written by longtime actor/director Jon Lindstrom (True Detective, General Hospital) and co-stars Burnett and Jeff Barry, the film features a fresh, first-rate ensemble that includes indie-film vets such as Cassandra Freeman (“Blue Caprice,” “Inside Man”) and a clutch of NYC up-and-comers.
