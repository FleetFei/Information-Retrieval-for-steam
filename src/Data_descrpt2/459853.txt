							Thanks to the wise rule of our genius Governor and the endless stream of advertisements beamed by our tireless PR agents, our clockwork-town earned the reputation of a must-see touristic destination! Nowadays, even the Astral Masters bless us with their presence, descending from their heavenly abodes to dispose of the boredom of eternal life over a game of roulette. But who would have thought that some of them won't stop at that, and would pick up on our town's grandest game: the Big Game for power, prestige and money?CONTENTSThis DLC completes the trilogy (Uninvited Guests, Mechanical Competitors and Astral Gamblers) and includes:12 new character portraits of the Astral Masters, visiting the clockwork-town on a gambling tour;an all-new communication feature: 4 powerful global effects to communicate your state of mind (including "This Means War", "The Dirigible of Justice" and "Rest in Peace");a new alternative music theme for the main menu (enigmatic, like most things from the Astral Plane);a new alternative background for the main menu;3 new themes to customise your player profile;3 new player icons for the lobby.OUR DLC POLICYWe remain committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features (e.g. special character abilities) and new content (e.g. new cards, new Misfortunes) that come in the form of regular updates that are FREE for every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we create and release fun stuff (animations, character portraits, alternative music themes) that is not related to the game mechanics, as paid DLCs. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments.
