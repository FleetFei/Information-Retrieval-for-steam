							All content included is royalty-freeWhile taking a break from his globetrotting tour schedule, acclaimed electric bassist, Janek Gwizdala (Randy Brecker, Mike Stern, V.V. Brown) stopped by The Loop Loft's studio in Boston to record this special collection of bass loops.  Performed on Janek's custom Fodera electric bass and recorded through numerous Universal Audio preamps, these loops capture both the feel and sound that have made him one of the most in-demand musicians in the world.  Covering tempos and grooves ranging from slow dubbed-out reggae, to in-the-pocket James Jamerson-esque finger funk, to pounding drum 'n' bass riffs, this loop collection will provide you with endless inspiration (and plenty of low-end) that will bring your tracks to life.
