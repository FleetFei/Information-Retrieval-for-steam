							Zurich Airport (previously known as Zurich-Kloten) is Switzerland’s largest airport. Its terminal opened in 1953 and expansion began almost straight away to handle the rapidly increasing traffic demands. The airport has three runways, ranging from 8,200 feet to 12,100 feet in length, and three docks – A, B and E. Dock B was closed to regular traffic in 2003 and, having been extensively rebuilt in 2011, has now reopened.FeaturesCustom buildings and objects with 3D details and rendered shadows and lighting.
