							Housed in a top secret location, the Asteroid Management Initiative (AMI) is a critical element in the Defense Departmentâ€™s struggle to keep the Earth safe from the constant onslaught of oncoming asteroids.  Its heroes are the "Rock Jocks", a group of overworked and underpaid misfits with exceptional satellite piloting skills.  Our story begins during a night shift, where the Rock Jocks have arrived to fend off the asteroids, yet spend most of the evening fighting off boredom, themselves, and a meddling government bureaucrat hell-bent on shutting them down.
