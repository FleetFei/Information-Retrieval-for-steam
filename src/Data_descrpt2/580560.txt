							IntroductionMillennium before this Kindom was founded,there once was a catastropheThe Lord of Devil--Zypheria broke into this world from his HadesZypheria was so indefectible that even the strongest Knights can’t even make a wound on its bodyThe whole world was at the end of its time,Until the lengend Knight came out,his name was HyliousHylious finally found something that could harm,even to destroy Zypheria--the Spirit stoneHylious eventually ended Zyhperia’s life with the help of the Spirit StoneBut overuse of the power in the Spirit stone led to Hylious’s own life too.Hylious was rewarded a more famous name, the Death knights, for his brave heart and his delication to this KindomBut today, decades of centuries passes, the Zypheria was rebirthed and coming back.
