"Bomb the Monsters!" features the story of a highly talented painter who is living a perfect life with his beloved wife. But one day things are changing when a huge horde of ugly monsters invade planet earth, capture the painter's wife, and exhaust and exploit the whole planet. Now it's up to the player to stop this horrible invasion and rescue the poor hostage - easier said than done!

The very well-known gameplay offers an easy entry into the game: In every level the player needs to place a limited amount of bombs next to the monsters for getting surroundings and buildings collapse on them to drive the monsters out. But the monsters are coming in various sizes and shapes and are fat, imbecile and extremely sticky. Because of the physical structure of their bodies, these stupid creatures stick to almost everything what makes it sometimes tricky to bomb them away.
