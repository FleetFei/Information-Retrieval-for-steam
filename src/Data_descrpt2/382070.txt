							About the gameNeoncube is a 2D platformer based around a neon world. The goal in the 50 included levels is as simple as opening a door and entering the next level. This seems easy at the beginning, but as your level progress increases, you might find yourself in a tricky situation. Especially the 5 bosses every 10 levels may increase the probability of ending up as a pile of neon shards.Features in the gameLevel Editor50 Levels are not enough? Well you're in luck!
