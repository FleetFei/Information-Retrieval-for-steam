
							About This Game
							It’s the hottest summer on record, and all across Europe, valuable objects are disappearing.

Museum curators unlock cabinets and find precious artefacts stolen. Wealthy mansion owners wake up to see their priceless paintings have vanished from the walls.

One thing’s clear: a master thief is touring the continent and the police are left scratching their heads.

In this 15 minute game by Crows Crows Crows, a team led by William Pugh (The Stanley Parable), slip into the soft-soled shoes of the mastermind responsible…

… silently cross the darkened lawn of the mansion…

… hold tight to the tranquiliser gun in your pocket, and commit the most audacious heis--

oh god I can’t do this any more, i’m joining the strike. i didn’t want to -  i honestly didn’t want to, but it’s gone too far

i’m supposed to be writing the steam store description and that’s it, that’s my job, but because of the understaffing i’ve been told i need to work in the lighting department too and it’s only a matter of time before i’m re-assigned to wildlife preparation

and everybody knows that working for wildlife preparation is mostly about trying very hard not to be eaten by the tiger

so that’s it, i’m joining the picket. if they want somebody else to finish the description, that’s their problem

i’m out.
