-To get to the boss you have to go through the path of challenges. Throw the dice to move forward a certain number of stepes. You may step on the treasure cell, and also stumble upon powerful monsters. The further you go the better things you can find. If you die you will lose all things except those that you have equipped. So, it is better to retreat and restore your health than to lose everything, but on the other hand you have to start dungeon again.
