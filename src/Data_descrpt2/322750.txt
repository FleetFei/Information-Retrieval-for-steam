Then and only then a different kind of shoot'em'up, accessible to a wider audience than usual.Drifting Lands main characteristics are:  randomy generated missions for replayability 100 levels of difficulty to climb with your skill or your ability to optimize your gear and powers 70 active and passive powers with various effects: dash, area of effect attacks, time control, etc. a complex item generation system with a lot of stat modifiers to optimize, unique items with "game changer" powers 3 classes of ships for different profiles of players Not your usual bland heroic fantasy universeDrifting Lands is designed to meet both shmup and hack & slash enthusiasts’ expectations.With the choice of your class, you’ll have the opportunity to take control of different ships, best suited to your favorite gameplay style.You’re a super player of bullet hells and don’t mind dying on the first few impacts ?You’ll find a perfect class for you with high-damages / low-resistances interceptors.
