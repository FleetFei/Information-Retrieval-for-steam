							All content included is royalty-freeKnown for his virtuosic command of a custom 7-string guitar in his own band (as well as with Norah Jones, Mos Def, John Mayer, Dâ€™Angelo and countless others), Charlie Hunter brings his soulful and inspired playing to The Loop Loft for this special Artist Series release.Playing the bass lines, chords and lead lines in a simultaneous, mind-boggling, yet ever-grooving fashion, Charlie tracked 14 complete sessions for The Loop Loft.  With grooves ranging from funk, jazz, blues, latin, New Orleans' swagger and yes, even "dance" music, this collection contains a staggering 859 loops and weighs in at a hefty 1.68 GB.With two separate output jacks on his guitar (one for the bass pickup, another for the guitar strings) we were able to intimately capture Charlie's playing during the recording process and provide two loops for every groove, giving you control over both the high and low-end in your own production.  In addition, "mixed down" versions containing both pickups are provided, allowing you to easily drag and drop the loops into the DAW of your choice.Charlie Hunter "Looped" is not only ideal for studio productions, but is also an incredible practice tool.  Put the metronome away and lock in with Charlie's playing.  Slow grooves down to work out patterns, change keys with the click of a mouse or arrange the loops to create your own structure to practice over. The possibilities and inspiration are endless.
