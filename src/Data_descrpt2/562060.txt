Launched in 2007, the RMZ 450 was the first motocross bike with electronic fuel injection. The 2015 model introduces the revolutionary S-HAC (Suzuki Holeshot Assist Control) system: with this button one can change the mapping, choosing between two alternatives, according to whether you are riding on soft or hard surfaces. This ensures excellent feeling!
Released as a special edition of the F4 1000 S, the MV Agusta F4 Tamburini takes its name from the famous Italian designer. Presented to the public in 2005, it is the first F4 to mount the Torque Shift System (TSS) that makes the most of its 172.8 hp. Fully in carbon fibre, it can exceed 300 km/h. The bike was produced in a limited run of only 300 units.
