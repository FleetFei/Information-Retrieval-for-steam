A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizard’s spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizard’s private spell book to read. It might rain.You see, it could be worse. But as it is, there’s not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragon’s breath to be sniffed.Hang on, where’s that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think it’s going to be one of those days…
