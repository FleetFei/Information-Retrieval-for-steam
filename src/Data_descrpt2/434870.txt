							Have you ever thought to yourself, politics are so simple and the electoral process is perfect? Of course you haven’t. Megalo Polis gives you a taste of the insanity by throwing you onto the political trail, rubbing elbows, overselling scant promises, and engineering scandals to become the next President of the United States of America. There’s no rest on the campaign trail in this quick-witted RTS. You’ll need to think fast to recognize and seize opportunities to spread your influence… with maybe just a touch of manipulation.Any great (white) house sits atop a solid foundation. Build your campaign from the ground up as you identify key states, political allies and amass a loyal group of supporters to spread your word and do your bidding. But that’s only leg one of this political race. To truly achieve greatness, you’ll need to outsmart and outmaneuver your equally hungry rivals.Budget your time and your wallet as you persuade voters to vote in your favor, by any means necessary. Whether you’re making it rain on impressionable students or spreading seedy gossip, you’ll want to make it clear you deserve to be top dog. Who said political campaigns were clean business?Do you have what it takes to decide the nation’s future?
