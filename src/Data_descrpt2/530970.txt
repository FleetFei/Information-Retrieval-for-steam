							Early on in the Steam Controller release our customers made it clear there was a need for convenient storage of the wireless receiver. We agreed. This quickly was prototyped, refined, and shared with the community as part of the Steam Controller CAD Release. One of our engineers even spent his personal time refining and releasing a version that was optimized for 3d printing. The positive response from the Steam Controller fans made it obvious that there was a lot of interest and we should make a true molded part.		This custom battery door is a drop-in replacement for the stock battery door with the added benefit of a convenient spot to store your wireless receiver (wireless dongle).  Simply place the wireless receiver in the storage slot, replace the battery door and head out to a local LAN party or to a friendâ€™s house to play with your Steam Controller.  Wireless receiver slot is just for storage as it must still be plugged into the computer to function.  		Steam Controller sold separately.
