I wanted to tell You some things about myself and my game.  I am an engineer, programmer and 3D modeler. I have decided to make this game, because games are my passion. I have made this game alone and worked about 2 years on it (including learning). I did all the programming and 90% of the 3D assets. Do not expect a AAA quality game, but I can guarantee a decent game with good gameplay elements.
