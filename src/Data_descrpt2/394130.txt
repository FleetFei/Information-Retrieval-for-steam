							Step into the Vive and use your own two hands to reroute, remix, and redirect water flows to free trapped water bears! Water Bears VR is the next evolution of Water Bears, winner of the 2015 Serious Play Awards “Best in Show” and the 2015 CTR “Editor’s Choice for Excellence in Design.”Each puzzle starts with sad water bears that are desperately in need of water. Help them by building and rebuilding water flows using an ever-increasing variety of pipes. Walk around the puzzles in real space, viewing them from all sides to get ideas. Manipulate myriad colors, test your spatial reasoning, and make the most of your limited resources. There are dozens of puzzles and an awful lot of thirsty water bears that need your help![Standing / minimum playspace size: 2.3m x 2m / ]
