							Deep underground lies a reminder of Boarkindâ€™s darkest hours. All it takes is one little boar to dig it back up. Harkening back to the NES era, Full Bore is an open-world puzzle game that leaves you to your own devices. With curiosity as your only guide, you will figure out how the blocks around you behave, delve deeper into a strange underground, and eventually piece together the story of a world transfigured.Full Bore debuts a unique lighting engine that creates rich, atmospheric environments out of its old-school pixel art. Combined with our original bluesy soundtrack, you will soon find yourself immersed in Full Bore's mines, temples, scrapyards, lava tubes, inexplicable lakes and/or mysterious laboratories.With over 150 areas, no single intended path and secrets everywhere, Full Bore gives you a world in which you can always find something new (until you find everything)New on SteamFull Bore is digging its way to Steam for the first time in May, featuring both Part 1: The First Dig, and the never-before-played Part 2: Into Hard Earth.
