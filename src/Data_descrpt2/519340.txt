							In this video we talk about a little more about advanced techniques of creating thumbnail sketches. We discuss things such as rhythm , lighting , and texture. The video is 1 hr HD video, in addition I added another 1 hr video doing another black and white sketch. So you get 2 hours total of HD video footage of me painting with LIVE commentary, so you can see all my mistakes and thought process.
