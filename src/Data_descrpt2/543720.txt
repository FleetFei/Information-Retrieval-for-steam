Each run through can take as little as a few minutes once paths are learned, and enemies and traps figured out - but unlockable modifiers will demand additional objectives be met before an escape attempted - and powerful new equipment and vehicles can be unlocked to help in those attempts.One-Shot One-KillQuick and deadly twin-stick shooter combat where any one bullet, arc of electricity or landmine could mean instant death.2 Minutes in and outLearn the map, the enemies and the traps - and escape in minutes.
