For this reason Whirligig support 3 render paths for you to try, Directshow, Media Foundation and libVLC.DirectShowDirectShow offers the best support for playback but requires addition decoders to be installed to get the best from it. Once you've installed the decoders you will have access to a very large range of video playback formats and if you have an Nvidia card you can also take advantage of GPU decoding. There is a full description of how to do this in the forum:http://steamcommunity.com/app/451650/discussions/0/364042262873027118/Media Foundation (Windows 8 and 10 only)Media Foundation offers good suuport for most video formats. It comes as standard on both Windows 8 and 10. If you're consered about installing additional decoders on your system then this is a good option.libVLCYou can also try libVLC. This is a codec library which has a wide range of built in video decoders and streaming options. This library is used in the popular video player VLC. It offers a larger range of video playback options than Media Foundation and doesn't require decoders to be installed.Image Supportjpg,png,jps,pnsWhirligig works with most jpg and png files but works best when the image file resolution has a factor of 2.Supported Projection TypesFisheye 100,110,120,130,140,150,160,170,180,190,200,210,220,230,240,250,260,270,280,300,310,320,330,340,350,360Barrel 180,360Cinema/Flat ScreenCinema CurvedCustom Enviroments/RoomsHome CinemaBedroomLiving RoomCustom FormatsCube Map Horizontal TeeCube Map HorizontalCube Map Vertical TeeCube Map VerticalFacebook Cube Map 3x2Facebook PyramidGardenGnome Cube Map 3x2Kodak PixPro SP360LatLong 360x90LG360OctanePanasonic A500Ricoh Theta SSamsung Gear 360Vray Cubemap InvertVray CubemapAdvice and guides can be found in the discussion forum.http:// http://steamcommunity.com/app/451650/discussions/
