							 Deceptively simple levels in the beginning lead up to hardcore levels at the end. A large variety of shapes and constraints, randomly generated levels and brute force + random rotation protection will force you to use your spatial awareness in order to proceed. Without developing your mental rotation skills from level to level, you will find yourself constantly failing. In addition, you will have a noble mission to save humanity throughout the cyberpunk story.Why are you still reading and not downloading Security Hole?OK, here is one last thing: the game contains an endless survival mode, suitable for eSports thanks to an adjustable level code which allows competitors to play on the same level (built with the same random sequence).
