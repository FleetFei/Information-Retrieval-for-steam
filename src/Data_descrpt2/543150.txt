The game is set in a dark canyon, you’ll play a warrior who swears to defend the saint ice crystal that seals the devil with his life. And in order to awake the their king, varieties of monsters will come and attack you in all kinds of ways. The armed zombies, flied-in-the-sky little zombies, long-foot monsters which are very dangerous due to their faster moving speed...They could hurt you by shooting arrows and fireballs from a long distance, at this time (you may slightly turn your body to avoid these). And, they can also move to your position and straight hurt you face to face. The drastic fighting is so blood-boiling, what’ re you waiting for? Just come and fight!!!
