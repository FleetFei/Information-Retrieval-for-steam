							Reed Albergotti (Wall Street Journal) is calling the film 'Miracle meets Moneyball' describing the behind-the-scenes experience of four underdog women cyclists who become America's hope for a medal at the 2012 London Olympics after the men's team is banned during the Lance Armstrong drug scandal. The underfunded women turn to volunteers, including their husbands and an innovative approach using 'Data not Doping' in an attempt to do the impossible; win the first U.S. Women's Track Cycling medal in over 20 years.
