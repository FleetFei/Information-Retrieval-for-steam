							The Warriors DLC contains two original FaceRig avatars: Dra`Gosh and  Mittaka - The Swordart Mistress. They are lean, mean, fighting machines. 
For these avatars, emphasis was put on detail to be able to bring an orc and an amazon to life in a realistic manner.
In order to be accepted by the real time renders, like the one used by 3D games and also by Facerig, we had to optimize the geometry. 
The optimization process was not done automatically in order to better maintain shape fidelity, thus making possible a later stage of detail baking, which would have as information source the initial model.
