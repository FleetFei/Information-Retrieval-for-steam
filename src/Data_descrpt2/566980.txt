							The Kaiser’s cakes are so good he’s going to take over the world! ...Unless you stop him! Play as a variety of animals in a “VR Angry Birds with Airplanes” game. As you fly around bombing destructible puzzles in your attempt to destroy all the cakes. If only it were that easy! You also have to avoid bombing and destroying the presents, that are sometimes precariously close to those world dominating cakes. The initial challenge is to complete the puzzle by destroying all the cakes. You get extra points for each piece of the structure destroyed, and lose points for any presents lost. Do it all with the least number of bombs for the highest score. The only lose condition is running out of bombs, while cakes remain intact. No worries simply crash the plane and the level resets!FeaturesSimple Flight Controls1 Environments6 Flyable Airplanes36 Challenging PuzzlesHigh level of VR comfort
