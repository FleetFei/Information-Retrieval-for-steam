							From the wreck of an old Spanish Galleon, El Magdalena, comes the Legendary Hammerhead! This war-torn Great Hammerhead was bruised, battered, skewered, and splintered in the midst of a naval battle over 300 years ago. This legendary beast hasn't been seen in hundreds of years, but some claim he never stopped swimming.
