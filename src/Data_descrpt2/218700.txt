Work with Angelica as she puzzles her way through the past and uses her insights to stop the pattern in the future in this hidden object puzzle adventure.


Angelica actively participates as you explore detailed environments and sift through hidden-object scenes for clues. Using Angelica’s journal and a highly developed hint system, close the case in the present and in the past, by piecing together game-changing information for an unexpected twist.
