							Soak up the eclectic music of the unique indie abstraction known as ULTRAWORLD EXODUS.  Find your favorite chair and take in a twenty five song double album that features spaced out ambiance, catchy orchestrations, and toe-tapping beats.  The sole creator of the game was also the sole creator of the soundtrack so these songs are tightly linked to a specifically designed audio-visual experience.  While originally composed to compliment vibrant landscapes, this unusual mix of songs easily stands on it's own.  So throw on your headphones, sit back, and enjoy!
