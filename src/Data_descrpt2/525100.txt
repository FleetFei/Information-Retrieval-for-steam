							SLIVER.tv is a platform to record, view, and stream top esports games in fully immersive, 360 VR video. Our cutting edge, patented technology immerses the audience inside a 3D game world, viewing their favorite players and matches in an exciting new way never seen before. Many games that incorporate VR spectating require you to own the game or download a client; this is not one of those platforms. Instead, SLIVER.tv is a place to watch 360 VR game content from any source, similar to how one might currently watch a video on Youtube, or a streamer on Twitch!Watch esports from inside the gameLook up at the SKYCAM for a first person viewSLIVER.tv supports livestreaming in 360 VRSLIVER.tv is constantly adding new tools and features for the emerging VR community, and we can't do it alone.
