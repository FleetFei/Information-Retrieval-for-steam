							Nikos Kazantzakis Airport (LGIR) in Heraklion (or Iraklion, if you prefer the Greek) is the second-busiest airport in Greece. Squeezed in between the sea and the city, it has one of the most scenic approaches in the Mediterranean.

Heraklion’s location and pleasant climate make it an incredibly popular destination for many people. So popular in fact, that this airport will soon be replaced by a new one as it is no longer able to handle heavy traffic in the summer. That means the only way you will be able to visit this iconic airport is in the virtual world!

FSDG’s incarnation of Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is fully detailed, complete with famous landmarks, high resolution ground textures, photo real terrain coverage of Heraklion and custom terrain mesh. The airport itself features local apron vehicles along with realistic car traffic, complete and detailed airport lighting and detailed 3D objects.
