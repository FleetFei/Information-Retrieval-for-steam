Depending on what you believe and approve, your World Map takes shape. And depending on how you choose your approvals, your World may end up very differently.It may end up like this...Or even end up like this!Establishing Trade RoutesYou need to pay your admirals wages, and keeping a functioning fleet does not come cheap.As you progress in the game, you will discover more exotic produces from newly uncovered lands.
