It will hunt down your opponent to the point of giving him or her cold sweats. Its Furies, darker than your worst nightmares, will wilt the confidence of your fiercest opponents. It knows nothing of pity. It gives no quarter. It will stop at nothing to achieve victory. Though it is shrouded in shadow and darkness, don’t start thinking its soul is dark: the Furkhan is unfailingly loyal to the one its has chosen as its Drakoneer.Furkhans spend less mana for their special moves.It is said that Ogams are the oldest Drakos the world has ever known. Is it because they are steeped in magic and ancient secrets? Or because they’ve been guided by many Master Drakoneers on the Way? It’s hard to say, but one thing is certain: their knowledge of Mana is incomparable. For an Ogam, Mana is everything. An Ogam knows that Mana flows through dreams like blood through veins. His charm is poisonous and his dance is fatal.Ogams win mana when they discard a card.
