							A couple of years ago we decided to make a high quality, immersive single-player football management game that is genuinely free to play. After many, many months of development we are very proud to present the first iteration - Soccer Manager 15. We have always kept users at the forefront of everything we do at Soccer Manager so our plan now is to let you enjoy the game for free, hopefully tell your friends about it and - even better - let us know what you think of the game by contributing to one our regular community events or via our social media/forum channels. Your feedback will help us shape the next major iteration (Soccer Manager 16) due for release later this year.
