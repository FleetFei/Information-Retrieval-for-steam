							Nissa Revane’s fully unlocked “Guardians of the Wood” green-black deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Nissa Revane believes in one thing: the strength of her people. She commands an impressive army of elves: warriors and fighters, clerics and mages, all willing to fight and die for her and her goals of elvish dominance. If swarming your enemy doesn’t quite get the job done, eliminate the strongest opposition with pinpoint removal spells and claim victory!
