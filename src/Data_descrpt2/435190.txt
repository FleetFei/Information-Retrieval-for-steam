							Boston never sleeps and there are always Nuyen and Karma points to be earned for an industrious Shadowrunner if you know where to find a job. From collecting nanite samples from infected sites, freeing hostages and defusing bombs to defending against invading headcases, corp troops or crazed technomancers, a wealth of repeatable mission will keep you on your toes.

The MISSIONS pack provides veteran Shadowrunners with replayable missions for single or co-op gameplay. All missions will feature variable enemies, target positions and other elements to keep replay fresh and offer you hours of challenging gameplay.

You also gain an extra slot to create a new character build and try out new combinations!

The missions will appear on the world map after you have finished the Lockdown Campaign and refresh in regular intervals.

This update works for both Shadowrun Chronicles and Shadowrun Chronicles: INFECTED! Director's Cut.
