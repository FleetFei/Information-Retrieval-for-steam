							Our hero Seamus can't fly, but he never touches the ground. Instead, he hangs by a rope and harness as he maneuvers his way through over 60 challenging puzzles!
In Cubicity, you pass across five worlds, in each world he'll need to acquire new weapons and learn new strategies in order to solve the increasingly difficult puzzles that block his path. 

Part action/adventure, part puzzle/strategy, you'll need to be both smart and quick-fingered to reach the end. Are you up for the challenge?
