							The Never Alone soundtrack features a 33-minute audio journey from composer and sound designer Brendan J. Hogan. Re-mastered music from the game — as well as new and unreleased music — are combined with 3D audio soundscapes and sound effects to take the listener on a guided journey back through the story of Kisima Inŋitchuŋa. To make the most of the 3D audio technology, headphones are recommended.  The soundtrack also features eleven bonus tracks from composers Daniel L.K. Caldwell and Colin O'Malley, originally found in Never Alone's Cultural Insights and trailers.Look for the music files in your Steam library:\SteamApps\common\NeverAlone\Soundtrack
