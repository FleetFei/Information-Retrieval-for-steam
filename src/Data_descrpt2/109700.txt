							How would you command your forces if you stood outside of time?  Send your units forward and backward through time to the very moment when they're needed most?  Double your forces by sending them back to fight side by side with their past selves?  Would you execute a feint by executing an attack on their resources, and then change your original orders to target their production facilities?  Or would you go deeper...						Achron is the world's first meta-time strategy game, allowing you to dynamically alter your past and future actions, send your units back and forth through time, even engineer temporal paradoxes that work to your advantage.  Play through four single player campaigns, or then go online to face off against your friends in a fully dynamic temporal environment!
