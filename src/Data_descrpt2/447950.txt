							Partake in a 2D retro action the likes of which hasnâ€™t been seen since the collapse of the arcades decades ago. Experience intense non-stop action as you fight off space insect hordes, collect weapons and power-ups, and battle for high score bragging rights against the entire world. And you know, save mankind from extinction at the hands of caterpillars, scorpions, spiders, and a slew of other ill-tempered giant killer insects."Bad Caterpillar is the game you deserve, but also the one you need."- Commissioner Gordman
