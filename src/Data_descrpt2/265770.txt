							For victory you need only three tools - Cannons, Lasers and Rockets! Discover a spaceship MOBA game with 2D combat in 3D environment, wide variety of play styles and fun gameplay for casual and pro gamers alike.

We wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play - a game chock-full of what’s cool about spaceships shooting each other up and with none of that boring stuff.
We set out to make a game with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play.
So we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.

In our game you will discover that: 

SPACE COMBAT IS EASY 
A videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional navigation makes you dizzy and disoriented. But in CLR you struggle against your opponents, not against your controls. We simplified gameplay just enough so you wouldn’t need to BE a great star pilot to FEEL like one.

SPACE COMBAT IS INTERESTING 
No boring parts, only what you come for - going into combat to send some rockets into the other guy’s hull.
And if you eventually get a little tired of shooting, and start looking for more - be sure that we will give you more. Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!

SPACE COMBAT IS FUN 
We don’t really know what «realistic» starships will look like, so we don’t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship. 
We streamlined our gameplay as much as we could, and then we turned the coolness knob up to eleven!
