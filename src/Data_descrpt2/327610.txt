							The Eye of Horus Beam Splitter is the first expansion for Khet 2.0.  The new Beam Splitter piece splits the laser in two creating new offensive possibilities!

The Beam Splitter moves exactly like a Scarab.  It can move one space, rotate 1/4 turn, or swap with an adjacent piece.  When a laser hits either of the mirrors, however, instead of just bouncing off at a 90 degree angle, it also allows the beam to pass straight through adding a lot of complexity and nuance to the game.  Use this new functionality to sneak attack your opponents, or even destroy multiple pieces in the same turn!

The Beam Splitter expansion comes with 5 new starting configurations to take advantage of the Beam Splitter's unique abilities.  Try your hand against opponents online or the 5 levels of computer players!
