							This is the Original Soundtrack of Secrets of Grindea! It currently features 37 tracks (31 from Story mode, and 6 Arcade remixes), and new tracks will be added as the game itself expands.The soundtrack is composed by Andrew Riley (Lucky Lion Studios), who's a superb musician and overall just a swell kind of dude! When we started out on the project, we were all students with no money to spare, and so couldn't afford any music. Along came Riley, who was so hyped on our work that he couldn't let that stand! He offered to compose the music at student-friendly rates, without sacrificing an inch of the quality.We're very happy to be able to offer his music as a standalone soundtrack, and we hope you'll enjoy it!For more Andrew Riley, check out his website and his bandcamp!To listen to the music, you can either use Steam's own music player, or find the songs as MP3s in the game install folder.Track ListStory Mode01 - Main Theme02 - Startington03 - Pillar Mountains04 - The Black Ferrets05 - Battling Freddy and Teddy06 - Battling Vilya07 - Evergrind Fields08 - Rival09 - Arena Battle10 - Arena Victory11 - Evergrind City12 - Collector's HQ13 - Pumpkin Woods14 - The Unknown15 - Flying Fortress16 - Mini Boss17 - Challenge18 - Omen19 - Boss Theme20 - Battling Marino21 - Western Fields22 - Naniva23 - Winterlands24 - Master Ivy25 - Luke26 - Toy Factory27 - Temple of Seasons28 - Crisis29 - Sorrow30 - Santa Fae31 - Game OverArcade Mode Remixes01 - Pillar Mountains Arcade02 - Evergrind Fields Arcade03 - Pumpkin Woods Arcade04 - Flying Fortress Arcade05 - Winterland Arcade06 - Temple of Seasons Arcade
