							Healer's Quest is a lighthearted RPG in which you play solely as the healer of a ragtag bunch of unfocused, greedy and highly amoral adventurers. The only match to their (very lacking) skills is their lousy temperament. They will rush head-first into desperate combats, fall into the most obvious traps, get cursed, poisoned, paralysed, vampirized, or – even – killed. It is up to you to ensure they will endure the most grievous wounds and survive their ordeals, in spite of their cripling noobishness.You are their only hope. You are... their healer !Features :Learn to use 18 different spells. Upgrade them to customize your strategy. Each spell has its own skill tree.Choose your Karma : Good, Evil or Victim!
