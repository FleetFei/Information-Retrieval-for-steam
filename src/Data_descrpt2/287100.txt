The game is highly influenced by games from 8-bit and 16-bit era, including Contra/Probotector series, as well as titles like Abuse and Doom Troopers. The game is set on a huge spaceship occupied by chaos cultists, where the main character (who clearly looks like a hi-tech version of the god Anubis) must kill everyone in sight.
