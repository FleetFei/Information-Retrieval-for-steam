							The Bleeding Hollow is a survival-horror themed sandbox style adventure for the Pathfinder RPG by Paizo. It is converted for Fantasy Grounds from over 100 pages of adrenaline pumping excitement for up to 6 players of 4th to 6th levels.

In this adventure, the players are drawn to the small wilderness town of Westden Falls to clear the surrounding environs of a particularly nasty group of harpies. Of course, nothing is as easy as it looks and the players soon find themselves embroiled in a plot between two ancient enemies.

Everyone becomes collateral damage, and the players must use every ounce of wit, survival instinct and tactics they possess to simply survive -- let alone helping those in need... This is not an adventure for the faint of heart, or the foolishly good. Hard moral choices will have to be made that will make your players sweat.

The adventure is written to follow the players, and not lead them. The choices they make will have great significance and possibly repercussions as the events unfold and the clock ticks down... Truly this is a fantastic sandbox style adventure.

The adventure is designed to scale for parties with more or less players, and even higher levels. Everything you need to run the game is at your fingertips.

The stunningly foreboding cover art is by Michael Fall. Our gruesome and frightening interior artwork is by Jason Lenox, the illustrator of 'Through the Eyes of Grizelda' and the upcoming gamer fan film 'Zero Charisma.'
