							Night Environment: Rhode Island for FSX: Steam Edition revolutionizes your VFR night flying experience. Using a series of databases, this add-on implements authentic and immersive lighting to different road types and other areas. Thousands of lights clearly illuminate highways that connect cities and smaller roads which link neighbourhoods. The Night Environment database contains more road data than default FSX: Steam Edition, so roads you may not see during the day become visible at night. All lights are visible for up to 60 miles for a more immersive experience.  All highway lights are raised above the surface and have a lit bitmap below them, giving them a 3D feel.  Night Environment: Rhode Island also comes with a configuration tool (Night Environment Manager v1.8) so you can customize the intensity of your night flying experience.Features: Full coverage of the state of Rhode Island, USA All major roads and most minor roads illuminated  Compatible with 3rd party scenery products including Orbx FTX and all photo scenery  Configurable for hardware performance  Configuration tool (accessible via the Tools section of your Steam library)
