							In this video we are discussing how to Kitbash with Lines in order to create environments. We will be talking about utilizing how to use 3D programs to get an initial blockout, making panels for modular designs , and then implementing them over 3D geometry. It's a nice way to be more efficient with your work and get a more cohesive design. It's about 2 hour worth of lectures broken up into 4 parts.
