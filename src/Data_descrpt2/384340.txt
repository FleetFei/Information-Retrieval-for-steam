Packetboat is a two-masted, fast ship, very capable in battle. Good firepower provided by a dozen of light cannons (5 on each board and 2 chase guns), tough hull structure and quite good downwind speed makes it formidable foe even to larger ships. Packetboats were extensively used in European coastal mail services and in times of war they were served as primary mean of communication between fleets.

Admiral account is purchasable for Gold. It allows you to get 50% more Fame, Expertise points and Piastres for each battle.  Bonuses of having Admiral account and famous ship multiply, i.e. you will be able to earn 87,5 % more Piastres and Fame point for each battle!
