							The digital artbook of Victor Vran is a 150+ pages long journey through the world of Zagoravia, the monsters, the characters and the tools of the hunter's trade, as imagined by our talented art team. To do justice to the creative process, we've included sketches, concepts, mood paintings, finished renders and even some "Visual Exploration" art that didn't made it in the final game.

The artbook is available in PDF format.

The original soundtrack of Victor Vran is composed by George Strezov and features 18 songs in MP3 format.
