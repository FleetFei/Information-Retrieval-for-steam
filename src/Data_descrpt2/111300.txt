							Real-time physics, innovative stunts and next-generation graphics combine into a dynamic, tricked-out RC car racing experience where players twist and turn, grind and gear up, performing aerial tricks and stunts while racking up points as they race to the finish in an unlikely location. Slam into unwitting tourists as you race for the finish. Set on a beautiful resort island, the fast-paced, bumper car gameplay transforms the relaxing setting into a frenzied raceway.
