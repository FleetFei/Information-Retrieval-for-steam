							Hey, you just died. But don't worry! All the major religions were wrong! Instead of ascending to a new plane of existence, you are now self-employed in the Afterlife with your own haunted house to run. Keep people just scared enough to keep believing in you, but not enough to alert the local authorities and you'll be able to live forever and maybe get your own reality show. 

Afterlife Empire was designed and written by Danielle Maiorino, created by Autobotika, published by The Fine Young Capitalists and funded by the gaming community. Enjoy a game with a diverse cast of all different races, religion and creeds funded by Gamergate and /v/

This is a demo of the game which is fully functional but will only allow you to explore your house for 15 minutes before returning you to the main menu.
