							In this free DLC, cleverly code named ”Santa’s Little Helper”, the hunt for the Deus Helix gets a christmassy makeover with intergalactic jingle bells, alien winter wonderlands and helpful holiday hints from your I-DBUGS elfs. Your favorite guide Nikodemus puts on his best holiday behavior (in the aftermath of the annual I-DBUGS Xmas party), and you might even spot Santa himself among the old Susurri worlds. Experience the epic helix hunt in the most festive of ways. Come celebrate the winter, or come back in the summer for all your Christmas needs.
