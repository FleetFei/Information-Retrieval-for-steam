Currently, you can build and play multi-player death matches with an ever-expanding list of special weapons and in-game tools like:  Jet Packs Bazookas Stun Guns Grappling Plunger  A wide variety of blocks and special art assets with a host of colors and functionsPrior to launch, future updates will allow you to build, share, and play new Q.U.I.R.K. game types like: King of the Hill  Sports Ball Arena Capture The Flag Tower Defense And the many, many game types that will be suggested by our community. While Q.U.I.R.K. master builders can currently share their levels directly with friends, we are on our way to building a full-featured UGC system using the Steam Workshop. For now, we'll be accepting new UGC submissions for death match arenas directly from the community.  Weâ€™re excited to be a part of the Steam Greenlight program, and look forward to hearing your feedback on Q.U.I.R.K. and your thoughts on improving our submission!
